      "it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will\r\n",
      "assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns,\r\n",
      "great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on\r\n",
      "a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as\r\n",
      "it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of\r\n",
      "the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and\r\n",

      "doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which\r\n",
      "case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never\r\n",
      "have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of\r\n",

      "particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could\r\n",

      "difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of\r\n",
      "respiration,--a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered\r\n",
      "necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a\r\n",
      "little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and\r\n",
      "the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter.  Now,\r\n",
      "if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful\r\n",
      "grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of\r\n",
      "profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been\r\n",
      "killed in no time.  There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old\r\n",
      "woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer;\r\n",
      "and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and\r\n",
      "Nature fought out the point between them.  The result was, that, after\r\n",
      "a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise\r\n",
      "to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been\r\n",
      "imposed  upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could\r\n",
      "reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been\r\n",
      "possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer\r\n",
      "space of time than three minutes and a quarter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his\r\n",
      "lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron\r\n",
      "bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly\r\n",
      "from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words,\r\n",
      "'Let me see the child, and die.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire:\r\n",
      "giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately.  As the\r\n",
      "young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed's head, said, with\r\n",
      "more kindness than might have been expected of him:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Lor bless her dear heart, no!' interposed the nurse, hastily\r\n",
      "depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which\r\n",
      "she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir,\r\n",
      "and had thirteen children of her own, and all on 'em dead except two,\r\n",
      "and them in the wurkus with me, she'll know better than to take on in\r\n",
      "that way, bless her dear heart!  Think what it is to be a mother,\r\n",
      "there's a dear young lamb do.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother's prospects failed\r\n",
      "in producing its due effect.  The patient shook her head, and stretched\r\n",
      "out her hand towards the child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The surgeon deposited it in her arms.  She imprinted her cold white\r\n",
      "lips passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face;\r\n",
      "gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back--and died. They chafed her\r\n",
      "breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever.  They\r\n",
      "talked of hope and comfort. They had been strangers too long.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's all over, Mrs. Thingummy!' said the surgeon at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah, poor dear, so it is!' said the nurse, picking up the cork of the\r\n",
      "green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to\r\n",
      "take up the child.  'Poor dear!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You needn't mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,' said\r\n",
      "the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. 'It's very\r\n",
      "likely it _will_ be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.'  He\r\n",
      "put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door,\r\n",
      "added, 'She was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She was brought here last night,' replied the old woman, 'by the\r\n",
      "overseer's order.  She was found lying in the street.  She had walked\r\n",
      "some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came\r\n",
      "from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand.  'The old\r\n",
      "story,' he said, shaking his head: 'no wedding-ring, I see. Ah!\r\n",
      "Good-night!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once\r\n",
      "more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair\r\n",
      "before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist\r\n",
      "was!  Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only\r\n",
      "covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it\r\n",
      "would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him\r\n",
      "his proper station in society.  But now that he was enveloped in the\r\n",
      "old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was\r\n",
      "badged and ticketed, and fell into his place at once--a parish\r\n",
      "child--the orphan of a workhouse--the humble, half-starved drudge--to\r\n",

      "by none.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic\r\n",

      "hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported\r\n",
      "by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities.  The parish\r\n",
      "authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether\r\n",
      "there was no female then domiciled in 'the house' who was in a\r\n",
      "situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of\r\n",
      "which he stood in need.  The workhouse authorities replied with\r\n",
      "humility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities\r\n",
      "magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be 'farmed,'\r\n",
      "or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse\r\n",
      "some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders\r\n",
      "against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the\r\n",
      "inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental\r\n",

      "a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to\r\n",
      "overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was\r\n",
      "a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children;\r\n",
      "and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself.\r\n",
      "So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own\r\n",

      "rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died,\r\n",
      "four-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable\r\n",
      "bait of air.  Unfortunately for, the experimental philosophy of the\r\n",
      "female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a\r\n",
      "similar result usually attended the operation of _her_ system; for at\r\n",
      "the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest\r\n",
      "possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen\r\n",
      "in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want\r\n",
      "and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by\r\n",
      "accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was\r\n",
      "usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers\r\n",
      "it had never known in this.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest\r\n",
      "upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead,\r\n",
      "or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a\r\n",
      "washing--though the latter accident was very scarce, anything\r\n",
      "approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm--the jury\r\n",
      "would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the\r\n",
      "parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a\r\n",
      "remonstrance.  But these impertinences were speedily checked by the\r\n",
      "evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of\r\n",
      "whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was\r\n",
      "very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever\r\n",
      "the parish wanted; which was very self-devotional.  Besides, the board\r\n",
      "made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the\r\n",
      "day before, to say they were going.  The children were neat and clean\r\n",
      "to behold, when _they_ went; and what more would the people have!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any\r\n",
      "very extraordinary or luxuriant crop.  Oliver Twist's ninth birthday\r\n",
      "found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and\r\n",
      "decidedly small in circumference.  But nature or inheritance had\r\n",
      "implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver's breast.  It had had plenty\r\n",
      "of room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and\r\n",
      "perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth\r\n",
      "birth-day at all.  Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth\r\n",
      "birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party\r\n",
      "of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a\r\n",
      "sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be\r\n",
      "hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly\r\n",
      "startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo\r\n",
      "the wicket of the garden-gate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Goodness gracious!  Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?' said Mrs. Mann,\r\n",
      "thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy.\r\n",
      "'(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash 'em\r\n",
      "directly.)--My heart alive!  Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you,\r\n",
      "sure-ly!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of\r\n",
      "responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he gave\r\n",
      "the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick\r\n",
      "which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle's.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Lor, only think,' said Mrs. Mann, running out,--for the three boys had\r\n",
      "been removed by this time,--'only think of that!  That I should have\r\n",
      "forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them\r\n",
      "dear children!  Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have\r\n",
      "softened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the\r\n",
      "beadle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,' inquired\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane, 'to keep the parish officers a waiting\r\n",
      "at your garden-gate, when they come here upon porochial business with\r\n",
      "the porochial orphans?  Are you aweer, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I\r\n",
      "may say, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'm sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear\r\n",
      "children as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,' replied Mrs.\r\n",
      "Mann with great humility.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his\r\n",
      "importance.  He had displayed the one, and vindicated the other. He\r\n",
      "relaxed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, well, Mrs. Mann,' he replied in a calmer tone; 'it may be as you\r\n",
      "say; it may be.  Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business,\r\n",
      "and have something to say.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor;\r\n",
      "placed a seat for him; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and\r\n",
      "cane on the table before him.  Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the\r\n",
      "perspiration which his walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the\r\n",
      "cocked hat, and smiled.  Yes, he smiled.  Beadles are but men: and Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now don't you be offended at what I'm a going to say,' observed Mrs.\r\n",
      "Mann, with captivating sweetness.  'You've had a long walk, you know,\r\n",
      "or I wouldn't mention it.  Now, will you take a little drop of\r\n",
      "somethink, Mr. Bumble?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not a drop.  Nor a drop,' said Mr. Bumble, waving his right hand in a\r\n",
      "dignified, but placid manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I think you will,' said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the\r\n",
      "refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it.  'Just a leetle drop,\r\n",
      "with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble coughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now, just a leetle drop,' said Mrs. Mann persuasively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What is it?' inquired the beadle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, it's what I'm obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put\r\n",
      "into the blessed infants' Daffy, when they ain't well, Mr. Bumble,'\r\n",
      "replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a\r\n",
      "bottle and glass.  'It's gin.  I'll not deceive you, Mr. B.  It's gin.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do you give the children Daffy, Mrs. Mann?' inquired Bumble, following\r\n",
      "with his eyes the interesting process of mixing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah, bless 'em, that I do, dear as it is,' replied the nurse. 'I\r\n",
      "couldn't see 'em suffer before my very eyes, you know sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No'; said Mr. Bumble approvingly; 'no, you could not.  You are a\r\n",
      "humane woman, Mrs. Mann.'  (Here she set down the glass.)  'I shall\r\n",
      "take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board, Mrs. Mann.'\r\n",
      "(He drew it towards him.)  'You feel as a mother, Mrs. Mann.'  (He\r\n",
      "stirred the gin-and-water.) 'I--I drink your health with cheerfulness,\r\n",
      "Mrs. Mann'; and he swallowed half of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And now about business,' said the beadle, taking out a leathern\r\n",
      "pocket-book.  'The child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine\r\n",
      "year old to-day.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bless him!' interposed Mrs. Mann, inflaming her left eye with the\r\n",
      "corner of her apron.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound, which was\r\n",
      "afterwards increased to twenty pound.  Notwithstanding the most\r\n",
      "superlative, and, I may say, supernat'ral exertions on the part of this\r\n",
      "parish,' said Bumble, 'we have never been able to discover who is his\r\n",
      "father, or what was his mother's settlement, name, or condition.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment's\r\n",
      "reflection, 'How comes he to have any name at all, then?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The beadle drew himself up with great pride, and said, 'I inwented it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You, Mr. Bumble!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I, Mrs. Mann.  We name our fondlings in alphabetical order. The last\r\n",
      "was a S,--Swubble, I named him. This was a T,--Twist, I named _him_.\r\n",
      "The next one comes will be Unwin, and the next Vilkins.  I have got\r\n",
      "names ready made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it\r\n",
      "again, when we come to Z.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, you're quite a literary character, sir!' said Mrs. Mann.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, well,' said the beadle, evidently gratified with the compliment;\r\n",
      "'perhaps I may be.  Perhaps I may be, Mrs. Mann.' He finished the\r\n",
      "gin-and-water, and added, 'Oliver being now too old to remain here, the\r\n",
      "board have determined to have him back into the house.  I have come out\r\n",
      "myself to take him there.  So let me see him at once.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'll fetch him directly,' said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room for that\r\n",
      "purpose.  Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of\r\n",
      "dirt which encrusted his face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed\r\n",
      "off in one washing, was led into the room by his benevolent protectress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Make a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,' said Mrs. Mann.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair,\r\n",
      "and the cocked hat on the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Will you go along with me, Oliver?' said Mr. Bumble, in a majestic\r\n",
      "voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great\r\n",
      "readiness, when, glancing upward, he caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had\r\n",
      "got behind the beadle's chair, and was shaking her fist at him with a\r\n",
      "furious countenance.  He took the hint at once, for the fist had been\r\n",
      "too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his\r\n",
      "recollection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Will she go with me?' inquired poor Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, she can't,' replied Mr. Bumble.  'But she'll come and see you\r\n",
      "sometimes.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was no very great consolation to the child.  Young as he was,\r\n",
      "however, he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at\r\n",
      "going away.  It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears\r\n",
      "into his eyes.  Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you\r\n",
      "want to cry; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed.  Mrs. Mann gave\r\n",
      "him a thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a\r\n",
      "piece of bread and butter, less he should seem too hungry when he got\r\n",
      "to the workhouse. With the slice of bread in his hand, and the little\r\n",
      "brown-cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never\r\n",
      "lighted the gloom of his infant years.  And yet he burst into an agony\r\n",
      "of childish grief, as the cottage-gate closed after him.  Wretched as\r\n",
      "were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind, they were\r\n",
      "the only friends he had ever known; and a sense of his loneliness in\r\n",
      "the great wide world, sank into the child's heart for the first time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping\r\n",
      "his gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at the end of every\r\n",
      "quarter of a mile whether they were 'nearly there.' To these\r\n",
      "interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for\r\n",
      "the temporary blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had\r\n",
      "by this time evaporated; and he was once again a beadle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an\r\n",
      "hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of\r\n",
      "bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old\r\n",
      "woman, returned; and, telling him it was a board night, informed him\r\n",
      "that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was,\r\n",
      "Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite\r\n",
      "certain whether he ought to laugh or cry.  He had no time to think\r\n",
      "about the matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head,\r\n",
      "with his cane, to wake him up: and another on the back to make him\r\n",
      "lively: and bidding him to follow, conducted him into a large\r\n",
      "white-washed room, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round\r\n",
      "a table.  At the top of the table, seated in an arm-chair rather higher\r\n",
      "than the rest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red\r\n",
      "face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bow to the board,' said Bumble.  Oliver brushed away two or three\r\n",
      "tears that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the\r\n",
      "table, fortunately bowed to that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's your name, boy?' said the gentleman in the high chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him\r\n",
      "tremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him\r\n",
      "cry.  These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating\r\n",
      "voice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool.\r\n",
      "Which was a capital way of raising his spirits, and putting him quite\r\n",
      "at his ease.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Boy,' said the gentleman in the high chair, 'listen to me. You know\r\n",
      "you're an orphan, I suppose?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's that, sir?' inquired poor Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The boy _is_ a fool--I thought he was,' said the gentleman in the\r\n",
      "white waistcoat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hush!' said the gentleman who had spoken first.  'You know you've got\r\n",
      "no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don't\r\n",
      "you?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What are you crying for?' inquired the gentleman in the white\r\n",
      "waistcoat.  And to be sure it was very extraordinary.  What _could_ the\r\n",
      "boy be crying for?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I hope you say your prayers every night,' said another gentleman in a\r\n",
      "gruff voice; 'and pray for the people who feed you, and take care of\r\n",
      "you--like a Christian.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, sir,' stammered the boy.  The gentleman who spoke last was\r\n",
      "unconsciously right.  It would have been very like a Christian, and a\r\n",
      "marvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people\r\n",
      "who fed and took care of _him_. But he hadn't, because nobody had\r\n",
      "taught him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well!  You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful trade,'\r\n",
      "said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So you'll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six o'clock,' added\r\n",
      "the surly one in the white waistcoat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process\r\n",
      "of picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and\r\n",
      "was then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he\r\n",
      "sobbed himself to sleep.  What a novel illustration of the tender laws\r\n",
      "of England!  They let the paupers go to sleep!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor Oliver!  He little thought, as he lay sleeping in happy\r\n",
      "unconsciousness of all around him, that the board had that very day\r\n",
      "arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence\r\n",
      "over all his future fortunes.  But they had.  And this was it:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and\r\n",
      "when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out\r\n",
      "at once, what ordinary folks would never have discovered--the poor\r\n",
      "people liked it!  It was a regular place of public entertainment for\r\n",
      "the poorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public\r\n",
      "breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and\r\n",
      "mortar elysium, where it was all play and no work.  'Oho!' said the\r\n",
      "board, looking very knowing; 'we are the fellows to set this to rights;\r\n",
      "we'll stop it all, in no time.'  So, they established the rule, that\r\n",
      "all poor people should have the alternative (for they would compel\r\n",
      "nobody, not they), of being starved by a gradual process in the house,\r\n",
      "or by a quick one out of it.  With this view, they contracted with the\r\n",
      "water-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a\r\n",
      "corn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and\r\n",
      "issued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and\r\n",
      "half a roll of Sundays.  They made a great many other wise and humane\r\n",
      "regulations, having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary\r\n",
      "to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in\r\n",
      "consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors' Commons; and,\r\n",
      "instead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had\r\n",
      "theretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him a\r\n",
      "bachelor!  There is no saying how many applicants for relief, under\r\n",
      "these last two heads, might have started up in all classes of society,\r\n",
      "if it had not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were\r\n",
      "long-headed men, and had provided for this difficulty.  The relief was\r\n",
      "inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened\r\n",
      "people.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was\r\n",
      "in full operation.  It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of\r\n",
      "the increase in the undertaker's bill, and the necessity of taking in\r\n",
      "the clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their\r\n",
      "wasted, shrunken forms, after a week or two's gruel.  But the number of\r\n",
      "workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were\r\n",
      "in ecstasies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a\r\n",
      "copper at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the\r\n",
      "purpose, and assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at\r\n",
      "mealtimes.  Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer, and\r\n",
      "no more--except on occasions of great public rejoicing, when he had two\r\n",
      "ounces and a quarter of bread besides.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The bowls never wanted washing.  The boys polished them with their\r\n",
      "spoons till they shone again; and when they had performed this\r\n",
      "operation (which never took very long, the spoons being nearly as large\r\n",
      "as the bowls), they would sit staring at the copper, with such eager\r\n",
      "eyes, as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was\r\n",
      "composed; employing themselves, meanwhile, in sucking their fingers\r\n",
      "most assiduously, with the view of catching up any stray splashes of\r\n",
      "gruel that might have been cast thereon.  Boys have generally excellent\r\n",
      "appetites. Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of\r\n",
      "slow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and\r\n",
      "wild with hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his age, and hadn't\r\n",
      "been used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small\r\n",
      "cook-shop), hinted darkly to his companions, that unless he had another\r\n",
      "basin of gruel per diem, he was afraid he might some night happen to\r\n",
      "eat the boy who slept next him, who happened to be a weakly youth of\r\n",
      "tender age.  He had a wild, hungry eye; and they implicitly believed\r\n",
      "him. A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the\r\n",
      "master after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to\r\n",
      "Oliver Twist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The evening arrived; the boys took their places.  The master, in his\r\n",
      "cook's uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his pauper assistants\r\n",
      "ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served out; and a long\r\n",
      "grace was said over the short commons.  The gruel disappeared; the boys\r\n",
      "whispered each other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors\r\n",
      "nudged him.  Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger, and\r\n",
      "reckless with misery.  He rose from the table; and advancing to the\r\n",
      "master, basin and spoon in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own\r\n",
      "temerity:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Please, sir, I want some more.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The master was a fat, healthy man; but he turned very pale. He gazed in\r\n",
      "stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then\r\n",
      "clung for support to the copper.  The assistants were paralysed with\r\n",
      "wonder; the boys with fear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What!' said the master at length, in a faint voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Please, sir,' replied Oliver, 'I want some more.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The master aimed a blow at Oliver's head with the ladle; pinioned him\r\n",
      "in his arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into\r\n",
      "the room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high\r\n",
      "chair, said,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mr. Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir!  Oliver Twist has asked for\r\n",
      "more!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a general start.  Horror was depicted on every countenance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'For _more_!' said Mr. Limbkins.  'Compose yourself, Bumble, and answer\r\n",
      "me distinctly.  Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had\r\n",
      "eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the\r\n",
      "hands of the parish.  In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were\r\n",

      "RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT\r\n",
      "HAVE BEEN A SINECURE\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of\r\n",
      "asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and\r\n",
      "solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of\r\n",
      "the board.  It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose,\r\n",
      "that, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the\r\n",
      "prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have\r\n",
      "established that sage individual's prophetic character, once and for\r\n",
      "ever, by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the\r\n",
      "wall, and attaching himself to the other.  To the performance of this\r\n",
      "feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that\r\n",
      "pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for\r\n",
      "all future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the\r\n",
      "express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and\r\n",
      "pronounced under their hands and seals.  There was a still greater\r\n",
      "obstacle in Oliver's youth and childishness.  He only cried bitterly\r\n",
      "all day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little\r\n",
      "hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the\r\n",
      "corner, tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble,\r\n",
      "and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even\r\n",
      "its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness\r\n",
      "which surrounded him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let it not be supposed by the enemies of 'the system,' that, during the\r\n",
      "period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of\r\n",
      "exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious\r\n",
      "consolation.  As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was\r\n",
      "allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump, in a\r\n",
      "stone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his catching\r\n",
      "cold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated\r\n",
      "applications of the cane.  As for society, he was carried every other\r\n",
      "day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a\r\n",
      "public warning and example.  And so far from being denied the\r\n",
      "advantages of religious consolation, he was kicked into the same\r\n",
      "apartment every evening at prayer-time, and there permitted to listen\r\n",
      "to, and console his mind with, a general supplication of the boys,\r\n",
      "containing a special clause, therein inserted by authority of the\r\n",
      "board, in which they entreated to be made good, virtuous, contented,\r\n",
      "and obedient, and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver\r\n",
      "Twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the\r\n",
      "exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness, and an\r\n",
      "article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It chanced one morning, while Oliver's affairs were in this auspicious\r\n",
      "and comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweep, went his way\r\n",
      "down the High Street, deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means\r\n",
      "of paying certain arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become\r\n",
      "rather pressing.  Mr. Gamfield's most sanguine estimate of his finances\r\n",
      "could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount;\r\n",
      "and, in a species of arithmetical desperation, he was alternately\r\n",
      "cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his\r\n",
      "eyes encountered the bill on the gate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Wo--o!' said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably,\r\n",
      "whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when\r\n",
      "he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was\r\n",
      "laden; so, without noticing the word of command, he jogged onward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but\r\n",
      "more particularly on his eyes; and, running after him, bestowed a blow\r\n",
      "on his head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a\r\n",
      "donkey's.  Then, catching hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp\r\n",
      "wrench, by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master; and\r\n",
      "by these means turned him round.  He then gave him another blow on the\r\n",
      "head, just to stun him till he came back again.  Having completed these\r\n",
      "arrangements, he walked up to the gate, to read the bill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with\r\n",
      "his hands behind him, after having delivered himself of some profound\r\n",
      "sentiments in the board-room.  Having witnessed the little dispute\r\n",
      "between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that\r\n",
      "person came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield\r\n",
      "was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted.  Mr. Gamfield\r\n",
      "smiled, too, as he perused the document; for five pounds was just the\r\n",
      "sum he had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was\r\n",
      "encumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse\r\n",
      "was, well knew he would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing\r\n",
      "for register stoves.  So, he spelt the bill through again, from\r\n",
      "beginning to end; and then, touching his fur cap in token of humility,\r\n",
      "accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to 'prentis,' said Mr.\r\n",
      "Gamfield.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ay, my man,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a\r\n",
      "condescending smile.  'What of him?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in a\r\n",
      "good 'spectable chimbley-sweepin' bisness,' said Mr. Gamfield, 'I wants\r\n",
      "a 'prentis, and I am ready to take him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Walk in,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.  Mr. Gamfield\r\n",
      "having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head,\r\n",
      "and another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his\r\n",
      "absence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room\r\n",
      "where Oliver had first seen him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's a nasty trade,' said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had again stated\r\n",
      "his wish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,' said another\r\n",
      "gentleman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley\r\n",
      "to make 'em come down again,' said Gamfield; 'that's all smoke, and no\r\n",
      "blaze; vereas smoke ain't o' no use at all in making a boy come down,\r\n",
      "for it only sinds him to sleep, and that's wot he likes.  Boys is wery\r\n",
      "obstinit, and wery lazy, Gen'l'men, and there's nothink like a good hot\r\n",
      "blaze to make 'em come down vith a run.  It's humane too, gen'l'men,\r\n",
      "acause, even if they've stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet\r\n",
      "makes 'em struggle to hextricate theirselves.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this\r\n",
      "explanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr.\r\n",
      "Limbkins.  The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a\r\n",
      "few minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words 'saving of\r\n",
      "expenditure,' 'looked well in the accounts,' 'have a printed report\r\n",
      "published,' were alone audible.  These only chanced to be heard,\r\n",
      "indeed, or account of their being very frequently repeated with great\r\n",
      "emphasis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having\r\n",
      "resumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We have considered your proposition, and we don't approve of it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not at all,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Decidedly not,' added the other members.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of\r\n",
      "having bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him\r\n",
      "that the board had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into\r\n",
      "their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their\r\n",
      "proceedings. It was very unlike their general mode of doing business,\r\n",
      "if they had; but still, as he had no particular wish to revive the\r\n",
      "rumour, he twisted his cap in his hands, and walked slowly from the\r\n",
      "table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So you won't let me have him, gen'l'men?' said Mr. Gamfield, pausing\r\n",
      "near the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' replied Mr. Limbkins; 'at least, as it's a nasty business, we\r\n",
      "think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Gamfield's countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he\r\n",
      "returned to the table, and said,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What'll you give, gen'l'men?  Come!  Don't be too hard on a poor man.\r\n",
      "What'll you give?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I should say, three pound ten was plenty,' said Mr. Limbkins.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ten shillings too much,' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come!' said Gamfield; 'say four pound, gen'l'men.  Say four pound, and\r\n",
      "you've got rid of him for good and all.  There!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Three pound ten,' repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come!  I'll split the diff'erence, gen'l'men,' urged Gamfield. 'Three\r\n",
      "pound fifteen.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not a farthing more,' was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You're desperate hard upon me, gen'l'men,' said Gamfield, wavering.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Pooh!  pooh!  nonsense!' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\r\n",
      "'He'd be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium. Take him, you silly\r\n",
      "fellow!  He's just the boy for you.  He wants the stick, now and then:\r\n",
      "it'll do him good; and his board needn't come very expensive, for he\r\n",
      "hasn't been overfed since he was born.  Ha!  ha!  ha!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and,\r\n",
      "observing a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile himself.\r\n",
      "The bargain was made.  Mr. Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver\r\n",
      "Twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for\r\n",
      "signature and approval, that very afternoon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his excessive\r\n",
      "astonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself\r\n",
      "into a clean shirt.  He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic\r\n",
      "performance, when Mr. Bumble brought him, with his own hands, a basin\r\n",
      "of gruel, and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of\r\n",
      "bread. At this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously:\r\n",
      "thinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill\r\n",
      "him for some useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten\r\n",
      "him up in that way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Don't make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be thankful,'\r\n",
      "said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity. 'You're a going to\r\n",
      "be made a 'prentice of, Oliver.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A prentice, sir!' said the child, trembling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, Oliver,' said Mr. Bumble.  'The kind and blessed gentleman which\r\n",
      "is so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of your own: are\r\n",
      "a going to 'prentice' you: and to set you up in life, and make a man of\r\n",
      "you: although the expense to the parish is three pound ten!--three\r\n",
      "pound ten, Oliver!--seventy shillins--one hundred and forty\r\n",
      "sixpences!--and all for a naughty orphan which nobody can't love.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this address in\r\n",
      "an awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child's face, and he\r\n",
      "sobbed bitterly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come,' said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was gratifying\r\n",
      "to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced;\r\n",
      "'Come, Oliver!  Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don't\r\n",
      "cry into your gruel; that's a very foolish action, Oliver.'  It\r\n",
      "certainly was, for there was quite enough water in it already.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all\r\n",
      "he would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the\r\n",
      "gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like\r\n",
      "it very much indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey:\r\n",
      "the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in\r\n",
      "either particular, there was no telling what would be done to him. When\r\n",
      "they arrived at the office, he was shut up in a little room by himself,\r\n",
      "and admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there, until he came back to fetch\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half an hour.  At\r\n",
      "the expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head, unadorned\r\n",
      "with the cocked hat, and said aloud:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.'  As Mr. Bumble said\r\n",
      "this, he put on a grim and threatening look, and added, in a low voice,\r\n",
      "'Mind what I told you, you young rascal!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble's face at this somewhat\r\n",
      "contradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his\r\n",
      "offering any remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining\r\n",
      "room: the door of which was open. It was a large room, with a great\r\n",
      "window.  Behind a desk, sat two old gentleman with powdered heads: one\r\n",
      "of whom was reading the newspaper; while the other was perusing, with\r\n",
      "the aid of a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles, a small piece of\r\n",
      "parchment which lay before him.  Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of\r\n",
      "the desk on one side; and Mr. Gamfield, with a partially washed face,\r\n",
      "on the other; while two or three bluff-looking men, in top-boots, were\r\n",
      "lounging about.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the\r\n",
      "little bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver had\r\n",
      "been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This is the boy, your worship,' said Mr. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a\r\n",
      "moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve; whereupon,\r\n",
      "the last-mentioned old gentleman woke up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, is this the boy?' said the old gentleman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This is him, sir,' replied Mr. Bumble.  'Bow to the magistrate, my\r\n",
      "dear.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance.  He had been\r\n",
      "wondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates' powder, whether all\r\n",
      "boards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards\r\n",
      "from thenceforth on that account.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well,' said the old gentleman, 'I suppose he's fond of\r\n",
      "chimney-sweeping?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He doats on it, your worship,' replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly\r\n",
      "pinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn't.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And he _will_ be a sweep, will he?' inquired the old gentleman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If we was to bind him to any other trade to-morrow, he'd run away\r\n",
      "simultaneous, your worship,' replied Bumble.\r\n",

      "'And this man that's to be his master--you, sir--you'll treat him well,\r\n",
      "and feed him, and do all that sort of thing, will you?' said the old\r\n",
      "gentleman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'When I says I will, I means I will,' replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You're a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest,\r\n",
      "open-hearted man,' said the old gentleman: turning his spectacles in\r\n",
      "the direction of the candidate for Oliver's premium, whose villainous\r\n",
      "countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty.  But the\r\n",
      "magistrate was half blind and half childish, so he couldn't reasonably\r\n",
      "be expected to discern what other people did.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I hope I am, sir,' said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I have no doubt you are, my friend,' replied the old gentleman: fixing\r\n",
      "his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the\r\n",
      "inkstand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the critical moment of Oliver's fate.  If the inkstand had been\r\n",
      "where the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen\r\n",
      "into it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been\r\n",
      "straightway hurried off.  But, as it chanced to be immediately under\r\n",
      "his nose, it followed, as a matter of course, that he looked all over\r\n",
      "his desk for it, without finding it; and happening in the course of his\r\n",
      "search to look straight before him, his gaze encountered the pale and\r\n",
      "terrified face of Oliver Twist: who, despite all the admonitory looks\r\n",
      "and pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance of his\r\n",
      "future master, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too\r\n",
      "palpable to be mistaken, even by a half-blind magistrate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and looked from Oliver to\r\n",
      "Mr. Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and\r\n",
      "unconcerned aspect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'My boy!' said the old gentleman, 'you look pale and alarmed. What is\r\n",
      "the matter?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stand a little away from him, Beadle,' said the other magistrate:\r\n",
      "laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of\r\n",
      "interest.  'Now, boy, tell us what's the matter: don't be afraid.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed that\r\n",
      "they would order him back to the dark room--that they would starve\r\n",
      "him--beat him--kill him if they pleased--rather than send him away with\r\n",
      "that dreadful man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well!' said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most\r\n",
      "impressive solemnity.  'Well! of all the artful and designing orphans\r\n",
      "that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hold your tongue, Beadle,' said the second old gentleman, when Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I beg your worship's pardon,' said Mr. Bumble, incredulous of having\r\n",
      "heard aright.  'Did your worship speak to me?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes.  Hold your tongue.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment.  A beadle ordered to hold\r\n",
      "his tongue!  A moral revolution!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked at his\r\n",
      "companion, he nodded significantly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We refuse to sanction these indentures,' said the old gentleman:\r\n",
      "tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I hope,' stammered Mr. Limbkins:  'I hope the magistrates will not\r\n",
      "form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper\r\n",
      "conduct, on the unsupported testimony of a child.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the\r\n",
      "matter,' said the second old gentleman sharply.  'Take the boy back to\r\n",
      "the workhouse, and treat him kindly.  He seems to want it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively\r\n",
      "and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he\r\n",
      "would be drawn and quartered into the bargain. Mr. Bumble shook his\r\n",
      "head with gloomy mystery, and said he wished he might come to good;\r\n",
      "whereunto Mr. Gamfield replied, that he wished he might come to him;\r\n",
      "which, although he agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem\r\n",
      "to be a wish of a totally opposite description.\r\n",

      "The next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was\r\n",

      "young man who is growing up, it is a very general custom to send him to\r\n",

      "counsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in\r\n",
      "some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port.  This\r\n",
      "suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done\r\n",
      "with him: the probability being, that the skipper would flog him to\r\n",
      "death, in a playful mood, some day after dinner, or would knock his\r\n",
      "brains out with an iron bar; both pastimes being, as is pretty\r\n",
      "generally known, very favourite and common recreations among gentleman\r\n",

      "providing for Oliver effectually, was to send him to sea without delay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries,\r\n",
      "with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a\r\n",
      "cabin-boy without any friends; and was returning to the workhouse to\r\n",
      "communicate the result of his mission; when he encountered at the gate,\r\n",
      "no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry, the parochial undertaker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt, large-jointed man, attired in a suit\r\n",
      "of threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour,\r\n",
      "and shoes to answer.  His features were not naturally intended to wear\r\n",
      "a smiling aspect, but he was in general rather given to professional\r\n",
      "jocosity.  His step was elastic, and his face betokened inward\r\n",
      "pleasantry, as he advanced to Mr. Bumble, and shook him cordially by\r\n",
      "the hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night, Mr.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'You'll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,' said the beadle, as he\r\n",
      "thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff-box of the\r\n",
      "undertaker: which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin.  'I\r\n",
      "say you'll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,' repeated Mr. Bumble,\r\n",
      "tapping the undertaker on the shoulder, in a friendly manner, with his\r\n",
      "cane.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Think so?' said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half\r\n",
      "disputed the probability of the event.  'The prices allowed by the\r\n",
      "board are very small, Mr. Bumble.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So are the coffins,' replied the beadle: with precisely as near an\r\n",
      "approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he ought to be;\r\n",
      "and laughed a long time without cessation.  'Well, well, Mr. Bumble,'\r\n",
      "he said at length, 'there's no denying that, since the new system of\r\n",
      "feeding has come in, the coffins are something narrower and more\r\n",
      "shallow than they used to be; but we must have some profit, Mr. Bumble.\r\n",
      "Well-seasoned timber is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron\r\n",
      "handles come, by canal, from Birmingham.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "profit is, of course, allowable.'\r\n",

      "'Of course, of course,' replied the undertaker; 'and if I don't get a\r\n",
      "profit upon this or that particular article, why, I make it up in the\r\n",
      "long-run, you see--he! he! he!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Just so,' said Mr. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Though I must say,' continued the undertaker, resuming the current of\r\n",
      "observations which the beadle had interrupted: 'though I must say, Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble, that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage:\r\n",
      "which is, that all the stout people go off the quickest.  The people\r\n",
      "who have been better off, and have paid rates for many years, are the\r\n",
      "first to sink when they come into the house; and let me tell you, Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble, that three or four inches over one's calculation makes a great\r\n",
      "hole in one's profits: especially when one has a family to provide for,\r\n",
      "sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an\r\n",
      "ill-used man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a\r\n",
      "reflection on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it\r\n",
      "advisable to change the subject.  Oliver Twist being uppermost in his\r\n",
      "mind, he made him his theme.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'By the bye,' said Mr. Bumble, 'you don't know anybody who wants a boy,\r\n",
      "do you?  A porochial 'prentis, who is at present a dead-weight; a\r\n",
      "millstone, as I may say, round the porochial throat?  Liberal terms,\r\n",
      "Mr. Sowerberry, liberal terms?'  As Mr. Bumble spoke, he raised his\r\n",
      "cane to the bill above him, and gave three distinct raps upon the words\r\n",
      "'five pounds':  which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of\r\n",
      "gigantic size.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Gadso!' said the undertaker: taking Mr. Bumble by the gilt-edged\r\n",
      "lappel of his official coat; 'that's just the very thing I wanted to\r\n",
      "speak to you about.  You know--dear me, what a very elegant button this\r\n",
      "is, Mr. Bumble!  I never noticed it before.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, I think it rather pretty,' said the beadle, glancing proudly\r\n",
      "downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat. 'The\r\n",
      "die is the same as the porochial seal--the Good Samaritan healing the\r\n",
      "sick and bruised man. The board presented it to me on Newyear's\r\n",
      "morning, Mr. Sowerberry.  I put it on, I remember, for the first time,\r\n",
      "to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman, who died in a doorway\r\n",
      "at midnight.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I recollect,' said the undertaker. 'The jury brought it in, \"Died from\r\n",
      "exposure to the cold, and want of the common necessaries of life,\"\r\n",
      "didn't they?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble nodded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And they made it a special verdict, I think,' said the undertaker, 'by\r\n",
      "adding some words to the effect, that if the relieving officer had--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Tush!  Foolery!' interposed the beadle.  'If the board attended to all\r\n",
      "the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk, they'd have enough to do.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Very true,' said the undertaker; 'they would indeed.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Juries,' said Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane tightly, as was his wont\r\n",
      "when working into a passion: 'juries is ineddicated, vulgar, grovelling\r\n",
      "wretches.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So they are,' said the undertaker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'They haven't no more philosophy nor political economy about 'em than\r\n",
      "that,' said the beadle, snapping his fingers contemptuously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No more they have,' acquiesced the undertaker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I despise 'em,' said the beadle, growing very red in the face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So do I,' rejoined the undertaker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And I only wish we'd a jury of the independent sort, in the house for\r\n",
      "a week or two,' said the beadle; 'the rules and regulations of the\r\n",
      "board would soon bring their spirit down for 'em.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Let 'em alone for that,' replied the undertaker.  So saying, he\r\n",
      "smiled, approvingly: to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish\r\n",
      "officer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr Bumble lifted off his cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the\r\n",
      "inside of the crown; wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his\r\n",
      "rage had engendered; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the\r\n",
      "undertaker, said in a calmer voice:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well; what about the boy?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh!' replied the undertaker; 'why, you know, Mr. Bumble, I pay a good\r\n",
      "deal towards the poor's rates.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hem!' said Mr. Bumble.  'Well?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well,' replied the undertaker, 'I was thinking that if I pay so much\r\n",
      "towards 'em, I've a right to get as much out of 'em as I can, Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble; and so--I think I'll take the boy myself.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and led him into the\r\n",
      "building.  Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes;\r\n",
      "and it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening 'upon\r\n",
      "liking'--a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that\r\n",
      "if the master find, upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out\r\n",
      "of a boy without putting too much food into him, he shall have him for\r\n",
      "a term of years, to do what he likes with.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When little Oliver was taken before 'the gentlemen' that evening; and\r\n",
      "informed that he was to go, that night, as general house-lad to a\r\n",
      "coffin-maker's; and that if he complained of his situation, or ever\r\n",
      "came back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea, there to be\r\n",
      "drowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so\r\n",
      "little emotion, that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened\r\n",
      "young rascal, and ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, although it was very natural that the board, of all people in the\r\n",
      "world, should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror\r\n",
      "at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody, they\r\n",
      "were rather out, in this particular instance.  The simple fact was,\r\n",
      "that Oliver, instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather\r\n",
      "too much; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state\r\n",
      "of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received.\r\n",
      "He heard the news of his destination, in perfect silence; and, having\r\n",
      "had his luggage put into his hand--which was not very difficult to\r\n",
      "carry, inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown\r\n",
      "paper parcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep--he pulled\r\n",
      "his cap over his eyes; and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumble's\r\n",
      "coat cuff, was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark;\r\n",
      "for the beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle always should:\r\n",
      "and, it being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by\r\n",
      "the skirts of Mr. Bumble's coat as they blew open, and disclosed to\r\n",
      "great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches.  As\r\n",
      "they drew near to their destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it\r\n",
      "expedient to look down, and see that the boy was in good order for\r\n",
      "inspection by his new master: which he accordingly did, with a fit and\r\n",
      "becoming air of gracious patronage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oliver!'  said Mr. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Pull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although Oliver did as he was desired, at once; and passed the back of\r\n",
      "his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a tear in them\r\n",
      "when he looked up at his conductor.  As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon\r\n",
      "him, it rolled down his cheek. It was followed by another, and another.\r\n",
      "The child made a strong effort, but it was an unsuccessful one.\r\n",
      "Withdrawing his other hand from Mr. Bumble's he covered his face with\r\n",
      "both; and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and\r\n",
      "bony fingers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well!' exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his little\r\n",
      "charge a look of intense malignity.  'Well!  Of _all_ the\r\n",
      "ungratefullest, and worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are\r\n",
      "the--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no, sir,' sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the\r\n",
      "well-known cane; 'no, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I\r\n",
      "will, sir!  I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so--so--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So what?' inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So lonely, sir!  So very lonely!' cried the child.  'Everybody hates\r\n",
      "me.  Oh! sir, don't, don't pray be cross to me!'  The child beat his\r\n",
      "hand upon his heart; and looked in his companion's face, with tears of\r\n",
      "real agony.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble regarded Oliver's piteous and helpless look, with some\r\n",
      "astonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky\r\n",
      "manner; and after muttering something about 'that troublesome cough,'\r\n",
      "bade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy. Then once more taking his\r\n",
      "hand, he walked on with him in silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his shop, was\r\n",
      "making some entries in his day-book by the light of a most appropriate\r\n",
      "dismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Aha!' said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing in\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'No one else, Mr. Sowerberry,' replied the beadle.  'Here! I've brought\r\n",
      "the boy.'  Oliver made a bow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh! that's the boy, is it?' said the undertaker:  raising the candle\r\n",
      "above his head, to get a better view of Oliver. 'Mrs. Sowerberry, will\r\n",
      "you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop, and\r\n",
      "presented the form of a short, then, squeezed-up woman, with a vixenish\r\n",
      "countenance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'My dear,' said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, 'this is the boy from\r\n",
      "the workhouse that I told you of.'  Oliver bowed again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Dear me!' said the undertaker's wife, 'he's very small.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, he _is_ rather small,' replied Mr. Bumble: looking at Oliver as\r\n",
      "if it were his fault that he was no bigger; 'he is small. There's no\r\n",
      "denying it.  But he'll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry--he'll grow.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah!  I dare say he will,' replied the lady pettishly, 'on our victuals\r\n",
      "and our drink.  I see no saving in parish children, not I; for they\r\n",
      "always cost more to keep, than they're worth. However, men always think\r\n",
      "they know best. There!  Get downstairs, little bag o' bones.'  With\r\n",
      "this, the undertaker's wife opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down\r\n",
      "a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark: forming the\r\n",
      "ante-room to the coal-cellar, and denominated 'kitchen'; wherein sat a\r\n",
      "slatternly girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very\r\n",
      "much out of repair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Here, Charlotte,' said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down,\r\n",
      "'give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip.  He\r\n",
      "hasn't come home since the morning, so he may go without 'em.  I dare\r\n",
      "say the boy isn't too dainty to eat 'em--are you, boy?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was\r\n",
      "trembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and a\r\n",
      "plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall\r\n",
      "within him; whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen\r\n",
      "Oliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected.\r\n",
      "I wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver\r\n",
      "tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine.  There is only\r\n",
      "one thing I should like better; and that would be to see the\r\n",
      "Philosopher making the same sort of meal himself, with the same relish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well,' said the undertaker's wife, when Oliver had finished his\r\n",
      "supper: which she had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful\r\n",
      "auguries of his future appetite: 'have you done?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There being nothing eatable within his reach, Oliver replied in the\r\n",
      "affirmative.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then come with me,' said Mrs. Sowerberry: taking up a dim and dirty\r\n",
      "lamp, and leading the way upstairs; 'your bed's under the counter.  You\r\n",
      "don't mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose? But it doesn't much\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Oliver, being left to himself in the undertaker's shop, set the lamp\r\n",
      "down on a workman's bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling\r\n",
      "of awe and dread, which many people a good deal older than he will be\r\n",
      "at no loss to understand.  An unfinished coffin on black tressels,\r\n",
      "which stood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like\r\n",
      "that a cold tremble came over him, every time his eyes wandered in the\r\n",
      "direction of the dismal object: from which he almost expected to see\r\n",
      "some frightful form slowly rear its head, to drive him mad with terror.\r\n",
      "Against the wall were ranged, in regular array, a long row of elm\r\n",
      "boards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light, like\r\n",

      "ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff\r\n",
      "neckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by\r\n",
      "four black steeds, approaching in the distance. The shop was close and\r\n",
      "hot.  The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins.  The\r\n",
      "recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust,\r\n",

      "best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation. The boy had no\r\n",
      "friends to care for, or to care for him.  The regret of no recent\r\n",
      "separation was fresh in his mind; the absence of no loved and\r\n",
      "well-remembered face sank heavily into his heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept\r\n",
      "into his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be\r\n",
      "lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the\r\n",
      "tall grass waving gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep\r\n",

      "repeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty-five times.\r\n",
      "When he began to undo the chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Open the door, will yer?' cried the voice which belonged to the legs\r\n",
      "which had kicked at the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I will, directly, sir,' replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and turning\r\n",
      "the key.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I suppose yer the new boy, ain't yer?' said the voice through the\r\n",
      "key-hole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'How old are yer?' inquired the voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ten, sir,' replied Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then I'll whop yer when I get in,' said the voice; 'you just see if I\r\n",
      "don't, that's all, my work'us brat!' and having made this obliging\r\n",
      "promise, the voice began to whistle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very\r\n",
      "expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the\r\n",
      "smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would\r\n",
      "redeem his pledge, most honourably. He drew back the bolts with a\r\n",
      "trembling hand, and opened the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street,\r\n",
      "and over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had\r\n",
      "addressed him through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm\r\n",
      "himself; for nobody did he see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post\r\n",
      "in front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut\r\n",
      "into wedges, the size of his mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then\r\n",
      "consumed with great dexterity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I beg your pardon, sir,' said Oliver at length: seeing that no other\r\n",
      "visitor made his appearance; 'did you knock?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "'Did you want a coffin, sir?' inquired Oliver, innocently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver\r\n",

      "way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yer don't know who I am, I suppose, Work'us?' said the charity-boy, in\r\n",

      "edifying gravity.\r\n",

      "'No, sir,' rejoined Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'm Mister Noah Claypole,' said the charity-boy, 'and you're under me.\r\n",
      "Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!' With this, Mr.\r\n",
      "Claypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a\r\n",
      "dignified air, which did him great credit.  It is difficult for a\r\n",
      "large-headed, small-eyed youth, of lumbering make and heavy\r\n",
      "countenance, to look dignified under any circumstances; but it is more\r\n",
      "especially so, when superadded to these personal attractions are a red\r\n",
      "nose and yellow smalls.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in\r\n",
      "his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a\r\n",
      "small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the\r\n",
      "day, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the\r\n",
      "assurance that 'he'd catch it,' condescended to help him.  Mr.\r\n",
      "Sowerberry came down soon after. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry\r\n",
      "appeared.  Oliver having 'caught it,' in fulfilment of Noah's\r\n",
      "prediction, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come near the fire, Noah,' said Charlotte.  'I saved a nice little bit\r\n",
      "of bacon for you from master's breakfast.  Oliver, shut that door at\r\n",
      "Mister Noah's back, and take them bits that I've put out on the cover\r\n",
      "of the bread-pan.  There's your tea; take it away to that box, and\r\n",
      "drink it there, and make haste, for they'll want you to mind the shop.\r\n",
      "D'ye hear?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'D'ye hear, Work'us?' said Noah Claypole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "you let the boy alone?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Let him alone!' said Noah.  'Why everybody lets him alone enough, for\r\n",
      "the matter of that.  Neither his father nor his mother will ever\r\n",
      "interfere with him.  All his relations let him have his own way pretty\r\n",
      "well.  Eh, Charlotte?  He! he! he!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, you queer soul!' said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in\r\n",
      "which she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully\r\n",
      "at poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest\r\n",
      "corner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially\r\n",
      "reserved for him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Noah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan.  No chance-child\r\n",
      "was he, for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his\r\n",
      "parents, who lived hard by; his mother being a washerwoman, and his\r\n",
      "father a drunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal\r\n",
      "pension of twopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction.  The\r\n",
      "shop-boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding\r\n",
      "Noah in the public streets, with the ignominious epithets of\r\n",
      "'leathers,' 'charity,' and the like; and Noah had bourne them without\r\n",
      "reply.  But, now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan, at\r\n",
      "whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn, he retorted on\r\n",
      "him with interest.  This affords charming food for contemplation.  It\r\n",
      "shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be; and how\r\n",
      "impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord\r\n",
      "and the dirtiest charity-boy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker's some three weeks or a\r\n",
      "month.  Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry--the shop being shut up--were taking\r\n",
      "their supper in the little back-parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after\r\n",
      "several deferential glances at his wife, said,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'My dear--'  He was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry looking up,\r\n",
      "with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he stopped short.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well,' said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing, my dear, nothing,' said Mr. Sowerberry.\r\n",

      "'Ugh, you brute!' said Mrs. Sowerberry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not at all, my dear,' said Mr. Sowerberry humbly.  'I thought you\r\n",
      "didn't want to hear, my dear.  I was only going to say--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, don't tell me what you were going to say,' interposed Mrs.\r\n",
      "Sowerberry.  'I am nobody; don't consult me, pray.  _I_ don't want to\r\n",
      "intrude upon your secrets.'  As Mrs. Sowerberry said this, she gave an\r\n",
      "hysterical laugh, which threatened violent consequences.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'But, my dear,' said Sowerberry, 'I want to ask your advice.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "manner: 'ask somebody else's.'  Here, there was another hysterical\r\n",
      "laugh, which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much.  This is a very\r\n",
      "common and much-approved matrimonial course of treatment, which is\r\n",
      "often very effective. It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging, as\r\n",
      "a special favour, to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most\r\n",
      "curious to hear.  After a short duration, the permission was most\r\n",
      "graciously conceded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's only about young Twist, my dear,' said Mr. Sowerberry. 'A very\r\n",
      "good-looking boy, that, my dear.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He need be, for he eats enough,' observed the lady.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear,' resumed Mr.\r\n",
      "Sowerberry, 'which is very interesting.  He would make a delightful\r\n",
      "mute, my love.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable\r\n",
      "wonderment.  Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and, without allowing time for\r\n",
      "any observation on the good lady's part, proceeded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear, but\r\n",
      "only for children's practice.  It would be very new to have a mute in\r\n",
      "proportion, my dear.  You may depend upon it, it would have a superb\r\n",
      "effect.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way,\r\n",
      "was much struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it would have been\r\n",
      "compromising her dignity to have said so, under existing circumstances,\r\n",
      "she merely inquired, with much sharpness, why such an obvious\r\n",
      "suggestion had not presented itself to her husband's mind before?  Mr.\r\n",
      "Sowerberry rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his\r\n",
      "proposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should\r\n",
      "be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this\r\n",
      "view, that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of\r\n",
      "his services being required.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The occasion was not long in coming.  Half an hour after breakfast next\r\n",
      "morning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against\r\n",
      "the counter, drew forth his large leathern pocket-book: from which he\r\n",
      "selected a small scrap of paper, which he handed over to Sowerberry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Aha!' said the undertaker, glancing over it with a lively countenance;\r\n",
      "'an order for a coffin, eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'For a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,' replied Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book: which, like\r\n",
      "himself, was very corpulent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bayton,' said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble.  'I never heard the name before.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bumble shook his head, as he replied, 'Obstinate people, Mr.\r\n",
      "Sowerberry; very obstinate.  Proud, too, I'm afraid, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Proud, eh?' exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer.  'Come, that's too\r\n",
      "much.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, it's sickening,' replied the beadle.  'Antimonial, Mr. Sowerberry!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So it is,' acquiesced the undertaker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We only heard of the family the night before last,' said the beadle;\r\n",
      "'and we shouldn't have known anything about them, then, only a woman\r\n",
      "who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial\r\n",
      "committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was\r\n",
      "very bad.  He had gone out to dinner; but his 'prentice (which is a\r\n",
      "very clever lad) sent 'em some medicine in a blacking-bottle, offhand.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah, there's promptness,' said the undertaker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Promptness, indeed!' replied the beadle.  'But what's the consequence;\r\n",
      "what's the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir?  Why, the husband\r\n",
      "sends back word that the medicine won't suit his wife's complaint, and\r\n",
      "so she shan't take it--says she shan't take it, sir!  Good, strong,\r\n",
      "wholesome medicine, as was given with great success to two Irish\r\n",
      "labourers and a coal-heaver, only a week before--sent 'em for nothing,\r\n",
      "with a blackin'-bottle in,--and he sends back word that she shan't take\r\n",
      "it, sir!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble's mind in full force, he\r\n",
      "struck the counter sharply with his cane, and became flushed with\r\n",
      "indignation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well,' said the undertaker, 'I ne--ver--did--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Never did, sir!' ejaculated the beadle.  'No, nor nobody never did;\r\n",
      "but now she's dead, we've got to bury her; and that's the direction;\r\n",
      "and the sooner it's done, the better.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first, in a\r\n",
      "fever of parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, he was so angry, Oliver, that he forgot even to ask after you!'\r\n",
      "said Mr. Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he strode down the\r\n",
      "street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of\r\n",
      "sight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at\r\n",
      "the mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble's voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He needn't haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble's glance,\r\n",
      "however; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman\r\n",
      "in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that\r\n",
      "now the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better\r\n",
      "avoided, until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years,\r\n",
      "and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish\r\n",
      "should be thus effectually and legally overcome.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well,' said Mr. Sowerberry, taking up his hat, 'the sooner this job is\r\n",
      "done, the better.  Noah, look after the shop. Oliver, put on your cap,\r\n",
      "and come with me.'  Oliver obeyed, and followed his master on his\r\n",
      "professional mission.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and densely\r\n",
      "inhabited part of the town; and then, striking down a narrow street\r\n",
      "more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through, paused\r\n",
      "to look for the house which was the object of their search.  The houses\r\n",
      "on either side were high and large, but very old, and tenanted by\r\n",
      "people of the poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have\r\n",
      "sufficiently denoted, without the concurrent testimony afforded by the\r\n",
      "squalid looks of the few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies\r\n",
      "half doubled, occasionally skulked along.  A great many of the\r\n",
      "tenements had shop-fronts; but these were fast closed, and mouldering\r\n",
      "away; only the upper rooms being inhabited.  Some houses which had\r\n",
      "become insecure from age and decay, were prevented from falling into\r\n",
      "the street, by huge beams of wood reared against the walls, and firmly\r\n",
      "planted in the road; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been\r\n",
      "selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches, for many of\r\n",
      "the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window, were\r\n",
      "wrenched from their positions, to afford an aperture wide enough for\r\n",
      "the passage of a human body.  The kennel was stagnant and filthy. The\r\n",
      "very rats, which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness, were\r\n",
      "hideous with famine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where Oliver\r\n",
      "and his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously through the dark\r\n",
      "passage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the\r\n",
      "undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs.  Stumbling\r\n",
      "against a door on the landing, he rapped at it with his knuckles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen.  The undertaker\r\n",
      "at once saw enough of what the room contained, to know it was the\r\n",
      "apartment to which he had been directed.  He stepped in; Oliver\r\n",
      "followed him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically,\r\n",
      "over the empty stove.  An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the\r\n",
      "cold hearth, and was sitting beside him. There were some ragged\r\n",
      "children in another corner; and in a small recess, opposite the door,\r\n",
      "there lay upon the ground, something covered with an old blanket.\r\n",
      "Oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place, and crept\r\n",
      "involuntarily closer to his master; for though it was covered up, the\r\n",
      "boy felt that it was a corpse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man's face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly;\r\n",
      "his eyes were bloodshot.  The old woman's face was wrinkled; her two\r\n",
      "remaining teeth protruded over her under lip; and her eyes were bright\r\n",
      "and piercing.  Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man.\r\n",
      "They seemed so like the rats he had seen outside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nobody shall go near her,' said the man, starting fiercely up, as the\r\n",
      "undertaker approached the recess. 'Keep back! Damn you, keep back, if\r\n",
      "you've a life to lose!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nonsense, my good man,' said the undertaker, who was pretty well used\r\n",
      "to misery in all its shapes.  'Nonsense!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I tell you,' said the man:  clenching his hands, and stamping\r\n",
      "furiously on the floor,--'I tell you I won't have her put into the\r\n",
      "ground.  She couldn't rest there.  The worms would worry her--not eat\r\n",
      "her--she is so worn away.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The undertaker offered no reply to this raving; but producing a tape\r\n",
      "from his pocket, knelt down for a moment by the side of the body.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah!' said the man: bursting into tears, and sinking on his knees at\r\n",
      "the feet of the dead woman; 'kneel down, kneel down--kneel round her,\r\n",
      "every one of you, and mark my words!  I say she was starved to death.\r\n",
      "I never knew how bad she was, till the fever came upon her; and then\r\n",
      "her bones were starting through the skin.  There was neither fire nor\r\n",
      "candle; she died in the dark--in the dark!  She couldn't even see her\r\n",
      "children's faces, though we heard her gasping out their names. I begged\r\n",
      "for her in the streets: and they sent me to prison. When I came back,\r\n",
      "she was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they\r\n",
      "starved her to death.  I swear it before the God that saw it! They\r\n",
      "starved her!'  He twined his hands in his hair; and, with a loud\r\n",
      "scream, rolled grovelling upon the floor: his eyes fixed, and the foam\r\n",
      "covering his lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman, who had\r\n",
      "hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that\r\n",
      "passed, menaced them into silence.  Having unloosened the cravat of the\r\n",
      "man who still remained extended on the ground, she tottered towards the\r\n",
      "undertaker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She was my daughter,' said the old woman, nodding her head in the\r\n",
      "direction of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer, more\r\n",
      "ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place. 'Lord, Lord!\r\n",
      "Well, it _is_ strange that I who gave birth to her, and was a woman\r\n",
      "then, should be alive and merry now, and she lying there: so cold and\r\n",
      "stiff!  Lord, Lord!--to think of it; it's as good as a play--as good as\r\n",
      "a play!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment,\r\n",
      "the undertaker turned to go away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stop, stop!' said the old woman in a loud whisper.  'Will she be\r\n",
      "buried to-morrow, or next day, or to-night?  I laid her out; and I must\r\n",
      "walk, you know.  Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is\r\n",
      "bitter cold.  We should have cake and wine, too, before we go!  Never\r\n",
      "mind; send some bread--only a loaf of bread and a cup of water.  Shall\r\n",
      "we have some bread, dear?' she said eagerly: catching at the\r\n",
      "undertaker's coat, as he once more moved towards the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, yes,' said the undertaker,'of course.  Anything you like!' He\r\n",
      "disengaged himself from the old woman's grasp; and, drawing Oliver\r\n",
      "after him, hurried away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a\r\n",
      "half-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble\r\n",
      "himself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the\r\n",
      "workhouse, who were to act as bearers.  An old black cloak had been\r\n",
      "thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man; and the bare coffin\r\n",
      "having been screwed down, was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers,\r\n",
      "and carried into the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!' whispered\r\n",
      "Sowerberry in the old woman's ear; 'we are rather late; and it won't\r\n",
      "do, to keep the clergyman waiting.  Move on, my men,--as quick as you\r\n",
      "like!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the\r\n",
      "two mourners kept as near them, as they could.  Mr. Bumble and\r\n",
      "Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs\r\n",
      "were not so long as his master's, ran by the side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had\r\n",
      "anticipated, however; for when they reached the obscure corner of the\r\n",
      "churchyard in which the nettles grew, and where the parish graves were\r\n",
      "made, the clergyman had not arrived; and the clerk, who was sitting by\r\n",
      "the vestry-room fire, seemed to think it by no means improbable that it\r\n",
      "might be an hour or so, before he came.  So, they put the bier on the\r\n",
      "brink of the grave; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp\r\n",
      "clay, with a cold rain drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the\r\n",
      "spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at\r\n",
      "hide-and-seek among the tombstones, or varied their amusements by\r\n",
      "jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin.  Mr. Sowerberry and\r\n",
      "Bumble, being personal friends of the clerk, sat by the fire with him,\r\n",
      "and read the paper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble,\r\n",
      "and Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave.\r\n",
      "Immediately afterwards, the clergyman appeared: putting on his surplice\r\n",
      "as he came along.  Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up\r\n",
      "appearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the\r\n",
      "burial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his\r\n",
      "surplice to the clerk, and walked away again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now, Bill!' said Sowerberry to the grave-digger. 'Fill up!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was no very difficult task, for the grave was so full, that the\r\n",
      "uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface.  The\r\n",
      "grave-digger shovelled in the earth; stamped it loosely down with his\r\n",
      "feet: shouldered his spade; and walked off, followed by the boys, who\r\n",
      "murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come, my good fellow!' said Bumble, tapping the man on the back. 'They\r\n",
      "want to shut up the yard.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man who had never once moved, since he had taken his station by the\r\n",
      "grave side, started, raised his head, stared at the person who had\r\n",
      "addressed him, walked forward for a few paces; and fell down in a\r\n",
      "swoon.  The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss\r\n",
      "of her cloak (which the undertaker had taken off), to pay him any\r\n",
      "attention; so they threw a can of cold water over him; and when he came\r\n",
      "to, saw him safely out of the churchyard, locked the gate, and departed\r\n",
      "on their different ways.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, Oliver,' said Sowerberry, as they walked home, 'how do you like\r\n",
      "it?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Pretty well, thank you, sir' replied Oliver, with considerable\r\n",
      "hesitation.  'Not very much, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah, you'll get used to it in time, Oliver,' said Sowerberry. 'Nothing\r\n",
      "when you _are_ used to it, my boy.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver wondered, in his own mind, whether it had taken a very long time\r\n",
      "to get Mr. Sowerberry used to it.  But he thought it better not to ask\r\n",
      "the question; and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he had\r\n",
      "seen and heard.\r\n",

      "The month's trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed.  It was a nice\r\n",
      "sickly season just at this time.  In commercial phrase, coffins were\r\n",
      "looking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great\r\n",
      "deal of experience.  The success of Mr. Sowerberry's ingenious\r\n",
      "speculation, exceeded even his most sanguine hopes.  The oldest\r\n",
      "inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so\r\n",
      "prevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful\r\n",
      "processions which little Oliver headed, in a hat-band reaching down to\r\n",
      "his knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the\r\n",
      "mothers in the town.  As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his\r\n",
      "adult expeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity\r\n",
      "of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a\r\n",
      "finished undertaker, he had many opportunities of observing the\r\n",
      "beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded\r\n",
      "people bear their trials and losses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich\r\n",
      "old lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of nephews\r\n",
      "and nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous\r\n",
      "illness, and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most\r\n",
      "public occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as need\r\n",
      "be--quite cheerful and contented--conversing together with as much\r\n",
      "freedom and gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb\r\n",
      "them.  Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic\r\n",
      "calmness. Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far\r\n",
      "from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to\r\n",
      "render it as becoming and attractive as possible.  It was observable,\r\n",
      "too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during\r\n",
      "the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached\r\n",
      "home, and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over.  All\r\n",
      "this was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with\r\n",
      "great admiration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good\r\n",
      "people, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm\r\n",
      "with any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for\r\n",
      "many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and\r\n",
      "ill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now\r\n",
      "that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the\r\n",
      "black stick and hatband, while he, the old one, remained stationary in\r\n",
      "the muffin-cap and leathers.  Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah\r\n",
      "did; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry\r\n",
      "was disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and\r\n",
      "a glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as\r\n",
      "comfortable as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in\r\n",
      "the grain department of a brewery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver's history; for I\r\n",
      "have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance,\r\n",
      "but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future\r\n",
      "prospects and proceedings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual\r\n",

      "half of the worst end of the neck--when Charlotte being called out of\r\n",
      "the way, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole,\r\n",
      "being hungry and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a\r\n",
      "worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the\r\n",
      "table-cloth; and pulled Oliver's hair; and twitched his ears; and\r\n",
      "expressed his opinion that he was a 'sneak'; and furthermore announced\r\n",
      "his intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable\r\n",
      "event should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty\r\n",
      "annoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was.\r\n",
      "But, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and\r\n",
      "in his attempt, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want\r\n",
      "to be funny.  He got rather personal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Work'us,' said Noah, 'how's your mother?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She's dead,' replied Oliver; 'don't you say anything about her to me!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver's colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and there\r\n",
      "was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole\r\n",
      "thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying.\r\n",
      "Under this impression he returned to the charge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What did she die of, Work'us?' said Noah.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Of a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,' replied Oliver:\r\n",
      "more as if he were talking to himself, than answering Noah. 'I think I\r\n",
      "know what it must be to die of that!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Tol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work'us,' said Noah, as a tear\r\n",
      "rolled down Oliver's cheek.  'What's set you a snivelling now?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not _you_,' replied Oliver, sharply. 'There; that's enough. Don't say\r\n",
      "anything more to me about her; you'd better not!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Better not!' exclaimed Noah. 'Well!  Better not!  Work'us, don't be\r\n",
      "impudent.  _Your_ mother, too!  She was a nice 'un she was.  Oh, Lor!'\r\n",
      "And here, Noah nodded his head expressively; and curled up as much of\r\n",
      "his small red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the\r\n",
      "occasion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yer know, Work'us,' continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver's silence,\r\n",
      "and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most\r\n",
      "annoying: 'Yer know, Work'us, it can't be helped now; and of course yer\r\n",
      "couldn't help it then; and I am very sorry for it; and I'm sure we all\r\n",
      "are, and pity yer very much.  But yer must know, Work'us, yer mother\r\n",
      "was a regular right-down bad 'un.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What did you say?' inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A regular right-down bad 'un, Work'us,' replied Noah, coolly. 'And\r\n",
      "it's a great deal better, Work'us, that she died when she did, or else\r\n",
      "she'd have been hard labouring in Bridewell, or transported, or hung;\r\n",
      "which is more likely than either, isn't it?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Crimson with fury, Oliver started up; overthrew the chair and table;\r\n",
      "seized Noah by the throat; shook him, in the violence of his rage, till\r\n",
      "his teeth chattered in his head; and collecting his whole force into\r\n",
      "one heavy blow, felled him to the ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet child, mild, dejected\r\n",
      "creature that harsh treatment had made him.  But his spirit was roused\r\n",
      "at last; the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire.\r\n",
      "His breast heaved; his attitude was erect; his eye bright and vivid;\r\n",
      "his whole person changed, as he stood glaring over the cowardly\r\n",
      "tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet; and defied him with an\r\n",
      "energy he had never known before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He'll murder me!' blubbered Noah.  'Charlotte!  missis!  Here's the\r\n",
      "new boy a murdering of me!  Help! help!  Oliver's gone mad!\r\n",
      "Char--lotte!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Noah's shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and a\r\n",
      "louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen\r\n",
      "by a side-door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she was\r\n",
      "quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human\r\n",
      "life, to come further down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, you little wretch!' screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with her\r\n",
      "utmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man\r\n",
      "in particularly good training.  'Oh, you little un-grate-ful,\r\n",
      "mur-de-rous, hor-rid villain!'  And between every syllable, Charlotte\r\n",
      "gave Oliver a blow with all her might: accompanying it with a scream,\r\n",
      "for the benefit of society.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Charlotte's fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should not\r\n",
      "be effectual in calming Oliver's wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into\r\n",
      "the kitchen, and assisted to hold him with one hand, while she\r\n",
      "scratched his face with the other. In this favourable position of\r\n",
      "affairs, Noah rose from the ground, and pommelled him behind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was rather too violent exercise to last long.  When they were all\r\n",
      "wearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver,\r\n",
      "struggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and\r\n",
      "there locked him up.  This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a\r\n",
      "chair, and burst into tears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bless her, she's going off!' said Charlotte.  'A glass of water, Noah,\r\n",
      "dear.  Make haste!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh!  Charlotte,' said Mrs. Sowerberry:  speaking as well as she could,\r\n",
      "through a deficiency of breath, and a sufficiency of cold water, which\r\n",
      "Noah had poured over her head and shoulders.  'Oh! Charlotte, what a\r\n",
      "mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah! mercy indeed, ma'am,' was the reply.  I only hope this'll teach\r\n",
      "master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures, that are born\r\n",
      "to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle. Poor Noah!  He was\r\n",
      "all but killed, ma'am, when I come in.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Poor fellow!' said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking piteously on the\r\n",
      "charity-boy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Noah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level\r\n",
      "with the crown of Oliver's head, rubbed his eyes with the inside of his\r\n",
      "wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him, and performed\r\n",
      "some affecting tears and sniffs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's to be done!' exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.  'Your master's not at\r\n",
      "home; there's not a man in the house, and he'll kick that door down in\r\n",
      "ten minutes.'  Oliver's vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in\r\n",
      "question, rendered this occurance highly probable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Dear, dear!  I don't know, ma'am,' said Charlotte, 'unless we send for\r\n",
      "the police-officers.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Or the millingtary,' suggested Mr. Claypole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no,' said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of Oliver's old\r\n",
      "friend.  'Run to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly,\r\n",
      "and not to lose a minute; never mind your cap!  Make haste!  You can\r\n",
      "hold a knife to that black eye, as you run along. It'll keep the\r\n",
      "swelling down.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Noah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his fullest speed;\r\n",
      "and very much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a\r\n",
      "charity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell, with no cap on his\r\n",
      "head, and a clasp-knife at his eye.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused\r\n",
      "not once for breath, until he reached the workhouse-gate. Having rested\r\n",
      "here, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an\r\n",
      "imposing show of tears and terror, he knocked loudly at the wicket; and\r\n",
      "presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that\r\n",
      "even he, who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of\r\n",
      "times, started back in astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, what's the matter with the boy!' said the old pauper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mr. Bumble!  Mr. Bumble!' cried Noah, with well-affected dismay: and\r\n",
      "in tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so much\r\n",
      "that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,--which is a very\r\n",
      "curious and remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a beadle,\r\n",
      "acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a\r\n",
      "momentary visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of\r\n",
      "personal dignity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!' said Noah:  'Oliver, sir,--Oliver has--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What?  What?' interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his\r\n",
      "metallic eyes. 'Not run away; he hasn't run away, has he, Noah?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, sir, no.  Not run away, sir, but he's turned wicious,' replied\r\n",
      "Noah. 'He tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder\r\n",
      "Charlotte; and then missis.  Oh! what dreadful pain it is!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such agony, please, sir!'  And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body\r\n",
      "into an extensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble to understand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of\r\n",
      "Oliver Twist, he had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from\r\n",
      "which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his\r\n",
      "dreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he observed a\r\n",
      "gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in\r\n",
      "his lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to\r\n",
      "attract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman\r\n",
      "aforesaid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The gentleman's notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked\r\n",
      "three paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young\r\n",
      "cur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with\r\n",
      "something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so\r\n",
      "designated, an involuntary process?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's a poor boy from the free-school, sir,' replied Mr. Bumble, 'who\r\n",
      "has been nearly murdered--all but murdered, sir,--by young Twist.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'By Jove!' exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping\r\n",
      "short.  'I knew it!  I felt a strange presentiment from the very first,\r\n",
      "that that audacious young savage would come to be hung!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,' said\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And his missis,' interposed Mr. Claypole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And his master, too, I think you said, Noah?' added Mr. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No! he's out, or he would have murdered him,' replied Noah. 'He said\r\n",
      "he wanted to.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah!  Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?' inquired the gentleman in the\r\n",
      "white waistcoat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, sir,' replied Noah.  'And please, sir, missis wants to know\r\n",
      "whether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog\r\n",
      "him--'cause master's out.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Certainly, my boy; certainly,' said the gentleman in the white\r\n",
      "waistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting Noah's head, which was about\r\n",
      "three inches higher than his own.  'You're a good boy--a very good boy.\r\n",
      "Here's a penny for you.  Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry's with your\r\n",
      "cane, and see what's best to be done. Don't spare him, Bumble.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, I will not, sir,' replied the beadle.  And the cocked hat and cane\r\n",
      "having been, by this time, adjusted to their owner's satisfaction, Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the\r\n",
      "undertaker's shop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here the position of affairs had not at all improved.  Sowerberry had\r\n",
      "not yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished\r\n",
      "vigour, at the cellar-door.  The accounts of his ferocity as related by\r\n",
      "Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble judged it prudent to parley, before opening the door.  With this\r\n",
      "view he gave a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and, then,\r\n",
      "applying his mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oliver!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come; you let me out!' replied Oliver, from the inside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do you know this here voice, Oliver?' said Mr. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,' replied Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ain't you afraid of it, sir?  Ain't you a-trembling while I speak,\r\n",
      "sir?' said Mr. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No!' replied Oliver, boldly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit, and was\r\n",
      "in the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a little.  He\r\n",
      "stepped back from the keyhole; drew himself up to his full height; and\r\n",
      "looked from one to another of the three bystanders, in mute\r\n",
      "astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,' said Mrs. Sowerberry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's not Madness, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble, after a few moments of\r\n",
      "deep meditation.  'It's Meat.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What?' exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Meat, ma'am, meat,' replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. 'You've\r\n",
      "over-fed him, ma'am.  You've raised a artificial soul and spirit in\r\n",
      "him, ma'am unbecoming a person of his condition: as the board, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Sowerberry, who are practical philosophers, will tell you.  What have\r\n",
      "paupers to do with soul or spirit?  It's quite enough that we let 'em\r\n",
      "have live bodies.  If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma'am, this would\r\n",
      "never have happened.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Dear, dear!' ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising her eyes to\r\n",
      "the kitchen ceiling: 'this comes of being liberal!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse\r\n",
      "bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else\r\n",
      "would eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in\r\n",
      "her voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble's heavy accusation.  Of\r\n",
      "which, to do her justice, she was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or\r\n",
      "deed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah!' said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth\r\n",
      "again; 'the only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to\r\n",
      "leave him in the cellar for a day or so, till he's a little starved\r\n",
      "down; and then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the\r\n",
      "apprenticeship.  He comes of a bad family. Excitable natures, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Sowerberry!  Both the nurse and doctor said, that that mother of his\r\n",
      "made her way here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed\r\n",
      "any well-disposed woman, weeks before.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this point of Mr. Bumble's discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to\r\n",
      "know that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced\r\n",
      "kicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible.\r\n",
      "Sowerberry returned at this juncture.  Oliver's offence having been\r\n",
      "explained to him, with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best\r\n",
      "calculated to rouse his ire, he unlocked the cellar-door in a\r\n",
      "twinkling, and dragged his rebellious apprentice out, by the collar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver's clothes had been torn in the beating he had received; his face\r\n",
      "was bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead.\r\n",
      "The angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he was pulled\r\n",
      "out of his prison, he scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite\r\n",
      "undismayed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain't you?' said Sowerberry; giving\r\n",
      "Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He called my mother names,' replied Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch?' said Mrs.\r\n",
      "Sowerberry.  'She deserved what he said, and worse.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She didn't' said Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She did,' said Mrs. Sowerberry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's a lie!' said Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative.  If he had\r\n",
      "hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be\r\n",
      "quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been,\r\n",
      "according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a\r\n",
      "brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of\r\n",
      "a man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital\r\n",
      "within the limits of this chapter.  To do him justice, he was, as far\r\n",
      "as his power went--it was not very extensive--kindly disposed towards\r\n",
      "the boy; perhaps, because it was his interest to be so; perhaps,\r\n",
      "because his wife disliked him. The flood of tears, however, left him no\r\n",
      "resource; so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs.\r\n",
      "Sowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble's subsequent application of\r\n",
      "the parochial cane, rather unnecessary.  For the rest of the day, he\r\n",
      "was shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of\r\n",
      "bread; and at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after making various remarks\r\n",
      "outside the door, by no means complimentary to the memory of his\r\n",
      "mother, looked into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings of\r\n",
      "Noah and Charlotte, ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the\r\n",
      "gloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings\r\n",
      "which the day's treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a\r\n",
      "mere child.  He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt;\r\n",
      "he had borne the lash without a cry: for he felt that pride swelling in\r\n",
      "his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last, though they\r\n",
      "had roasted him alive.  But now, when there were none to see or hear\r\n",
      "him, he fell upon his knees on the floor; and, hiding his face in his\r\n",
      "hands, wept such tears as, God send for the credit of our nature, few\r\n",
      "so young may ever have cause to pour out before him!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude. The\r\n",
      "candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet. Having\r\n",
      "gazed cautiously round him, and listened intently, he gently undid the\r\n",
      "fastenings of the door, and looked abroad.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a cold, dark night.  The stars seemed, to the boy's eyes,\r\n",
      "farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before; there was no\r\n",
      "wind; and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground,\r\n",
      "looked sepulchral and death-like, from being so still. He softly\r\n",
      "reclosed the door.  Having availed himself of the expiring light of the\r\n",
      "candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel\r\n",
      "he had, sat himself down upon a bench, to wait for morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the\r\n",
      "shutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door.  One timid look\r\n",
      "around--one moment's pause of hesitation--he had closed it behind him,\r\n",
      "and was in the open street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up\r\n",
      "the hill.  He took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across\r\n",
      "the fields: which he knew, after some distance, led out again into the\r\n",
      "road; struck into it, and walked quickly on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Along this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he had trotted beside\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm.\r\n",
      "His way lay directly in front of the cottage. His heart beat quickly\r\n",
      "when he bethought himself of this; and he half resolved to turn back.\r\n",
      "He had come a long way though, and should lose a great deal of time by\r\n",
      "doing so.  Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of\r\n",
      "his being seen; so he walked on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He reached the house.  There was no appearance of its inmates stirring\r\n",
      "at that early hour.  Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden.  A\r\n",
      "child was weeding one of the little beds; as he stopped, he raised his\r\n",
      "pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions.\r\n",
      "Oliver felt glad to see him, before he went; for, though younger than\r\n",
      "himself, he had been his little friend and playmate.  They had been\r\n",
      "beaten, and starved, and shut up together, many and many a time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hush, Dick!' said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his\r\n",
      "thin arm between the rails to greet him.  'Is any one up?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nobody but me,' replied the child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You musn't say you saw me, Dick,' said Oliver.  'I am running away.\r\n",
      "They beat and ill-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fortune, some\r\n",
      "long way off.  I don't know where.  How pale you are!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I heard the doctor tell them I was dying,' replied the child with a\r\n",
      "faint smile.  'I am very glad to see you, dear; but don't stop, don't\r\n",
      "stop!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, yes, I will, to say good-b'ye to you,' replied Oliver. 'I shall\r\n",
      "see you again, Dick.  I know I shall!  You will be well and happy!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I hope so,' replied the child.  'After I am dead, but not before.  I\r\n",
      "know the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of\r\n",
      "Heaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake.\r\n",
      "Kiss me,' said the child,  climbing up the low gate, and flinging his\r\n",

      "Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles\r\n",

      "YOUNG GENTLEMAN\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and once more\r\n",
      "gained the high-road.  It was eight o'clock now. Though he was nearly\r\n",
      "five miles away from the town, he ran, and hid behind the hedges, by\r\n",
      "turns, till noon: fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken.  Then\r\n",
      "he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone, and began to think,\r\n",
      "for the first time, where he had better go and try to live.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The stone by which he was seated, bore, in large characters, an\r\n",
      "intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London. The\r\n",
      "name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy's mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "London!--that great place!--nobody--not even Mr. Bumble--could ever\r\n",
      "find him there!  He had often heard the old men in the workhouse, too,\r\n",
      "say that no lad of spirit need want in London; and that there were ways\r\n",
      "of living in that vast city, which those who had been bred up in\r\n",
      "country parts had no idea of.  It was the very place for a homeless\r\n",
      "boy, who must die in the streets unless some one helped him. As these\r\n",
      "things passed through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and again\r\n",
      "walked forward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four\r\n",
      "miles more, before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could\r\n",
      "hope to reach his place of destination. As this consideration forced\r\n",
      "itself upon him, he slackened his pace a little, and meditated upon his\r\n",
      "means of getting there.  He had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and\r\n",
      "two pairs of stockings, in his bundle.  He had a penny too--a gift of\r\n",
      "Sowerberry's after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more\r\n",
      "than ordinarily well--in his pocket. 'A clean shirt,' thought Oliver,\r\n",
      "'is a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings;\r\n",
      "and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles' walk\r\n",
      "in winter time.'  But Oliver's thoughts, like those of most other\r\n",
      "people, although they were extremely ready and active to point out his\r\n",
      "difficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of\r\n",
      "surmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular\r\n",
      "purpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and\r\n",
      "trudged on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing\r\n",
      "but the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he\r\n",
      "begged at the cottage-doors by the road-side.  When the night came, he\r\n",
      "turned into a meadow; and, creeping close under a hay-rick, determined\r\n",
      "to lie there, till morning.  He felt frightened at first, for the wind\r\n",
      "moaned dismally over the empty fields: and he was cold and hungry, and\r\n",
      "more alone than he had ever felt before.  Being very tired with his\r\n",
      "walk, however, he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He felt cold and stiff, when he got up next morning, and so hungry that\r\n",
      "he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very\r\n",
      "first village through which he passed.  He had walked no more than\r\n",
      "twelve miles, when night closed in again. His feet were sore, and his\r\n",
      "legs so weak that they trembled beneath him.  Another night passed in\r\n",
      "the bleak damp air, made him worse; when he set forward on his journey\r\n",
      "next morning he could hardly crawl along.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came up, and\r\n",
      "then begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took\r\n",
      "any notice of him: and even those told him to wait till they got to the\r\n",
      "top of the hill, and then let them see how far he could run for a\r\n",
      "halfpenny.  Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way,\r\n",
      "but was unable to do it, by reason of his fatigue and sore feet.  When\r\n",
      "the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets\r\n",
      "again, declaring that he was an idle young dog, and didn't deserve\r\n",
      "anything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust\r\n",
      "behind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all\r\n",
      "persons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to\r\n",
      "jail.  This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out\r\n",
      "of those villages with all possible expedition.  In others, he would\r\n",
      "stand about the inn-yards, and look mournfully at every one who passed:\r\n",
      "a proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady's ordering one\r\n",
      "of the post-boys who were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out\r\n",
      "of the place, for she was sure he had come to steal something.  If he\r\n",
      "begged at a farmer's house, ten to one but they threatened to set the\r\n",
      "dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they talked about\r\n",
      "the beadle--which brought Oliver's heart into his mouth,--very often\r\n",
      "the only thing he had there, for many hours together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man, and a\r\n",
      "benevolent old lady, Oliver's troubles would have been shortened by the\r\n",
      "very same process which had put an end to his mother's; in other words,\r\n",
      "he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king's highway.  But\r\n",
      "the turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady,\r\n",
      "who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part\r\n",
      "of the earth, took pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him what little\r\n",
      "she could afford--and more--with such kind and gentle words, and such\r\n",
      "tears of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deeper into Oliver's\r\n",
      "soul, than all the sufferings he had ever undergone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place, Oliver\r\n",
      "limped slowly into the little town of Barnet. The window-shutters were\r\n",
      "closed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business\r\n",
      "of the day.  The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the\r\n",
      "light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation,\r\n",
      "as he sat, with bleeding feet and covered with dust, upon a door-step.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were drawn up;\r\n",
      "and people began passing to and fro.  Some few stopped to gaze at\r\n",
      "Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they\r\n",
      "hurried by; but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire\r\n",
      "how he came there. He had no heart to beg. And there he sat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great\r\n",
      "number of public-houses (every other house in Barnet was a tavern,\r\n",
      "large or small), gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed\r\n",
      "through, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with\r\n",
      "ease, in a few hours, what it had taken him a whole week of courage and\r\n",
      "determination beyond his years to accomplish: when he was roused by\r\n",
      "observing that a boy, who had passed him carelessly some minutes\r\n",
      "before, had returned, and was now surveying him most earnestly from the\r\n",
      "opposite side of the way.  He took little heed of this at first; but\r\n",
      "the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long,\r\n",
      "that Oliver raised his head, and returned his steady look.  Upon this,\r\n",
      "the boy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hullo, my covey!  What's the row?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was about his\r\n",
      "own age: but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even\r\n",
      "seen.  He was a snub-nosed, flat-browed, common-faced boy enough; and\r\n",
      "as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see; but he had about him all\r\n",
      "the airs and manners of a man.  He was short of his age: with rather\r\n",
      "bow-legs, and little, sharp, ugly eyes.  His hat was stuck on the top\r\n",
      "of his head so lightly, that it threatened to fall off every\r\n",
      "moment--and would have done so, very often, if the wearer had not had a\r\n",
      "knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch, which\r\n",
      "brought it back to its old place again.  He wore a man's coat, which\r\n",
      "reached nearly to his heels.  He had turned the cuffs back, half-way up\r\n",
      "his arm, to get his hands out of the sleeves: apparently with the\r\n",
      "ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy\r\n",
      "trousers; for there he kept them.  He was, altogether, as roystering\r\n",
      "and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six, or\r\n",
      "something less, in the bluchers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hullo, my covey!  What's the row?' said this strange young gentleman\r\n",
      "to Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I am very hungry and tired,' replied Oliver: the tears standing in his\r\n",
      "eyes as he spoke. 'I have walked a long way.  I have been walking these\r\n",
      "seven days.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Walking for sivin days!' said the young gentleman.  'Oh, I see. Beak's\r\n",
      "order, eh?  But,' he added, noticing Oliver's look of surprise, 'I\r\n",
      "suppose you don't know what a beak is, my flash com-pan-i-on.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird's mouth\r\n",
      "described by the term in question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'My eyes, how green!' exclaimed the young gentleman. 'Why, a beak's a\r\n",
      "madgst'rate; and when you walk by a beak's order, it's not straight\r\n",
      "forerd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down agin.  Was you\r\n",
      "never on the mill?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What mill?' inquired Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What mill!  Why, _the_ mill--the mill as takes up so little room that\r\n",
      "it'll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when the wind's\r\n",
      "low with people, than when it's high; acos then they can't get workmen.\r\n",
      "But come,' said the young gentleman; 'you want grub, and you shall have\r\n",
      "it.  I'm at low-water-mark myself--only one bob and a magpie; but, as\r\n",
      "far as it goes, I'll fork out and stump.  Up with you on your pins.\r\n",
      "There!  Now then! 'Morrice!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Assisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him to an adjacent\r\n",
      "chandler's shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of ready-dressed ham\r\n",
      "and a half-quartern loaf, or, as he himself expressed it, 'a fourpenny\r\n",
      "bran!' the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust, by the\r\n",
      "ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a\r\n",
      "portion of the crumb, and stuffing it therein.  Taking the bread under\r\n",
      "his arm, the young gentlman turned into a small public-house, and led\r\n",
      "the way to a tap-room in the rear of the premises. Here, a pot of beer\r\n",
      "was brought in, by direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver,\r\n",
      "falling to, at his new friend's bidding, made a long and hearty meal,\r\n",
      "during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time\r\n",
      "with great attention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Going to London?' said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length\r\n",
      "concluded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Got any lodgings?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Money?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The strange boy whistled; and put his arms into his pockets, as far as\r\n",
      "the big coat-sleeves would let them go.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do you live in London?' inquired Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes. I do, when I'm at home,' replied the boy. 'I suppose you want\r\n",
      "some place to sleep in to-night, don't you?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I do, indeed,' answered Oliver. 'I have not slept under a roof since I\r\n",
      "left the country.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Don't fret your eyelids on that score,' said the young gentleman.\r\n",
      "'I've got to be in London to-night; and I know a 'spectable old\r\n",
      "gentleman as lives there, wot'll give you lodgings for nothink, and\r\n",
      "never ask for the change--that is, if any genelman he knows interduces\r\n",
      "you. And don't he know me?  Oh, no! Not in the least!  By no means.\r\n",
      "Certainly not!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter fragments\r\n",
      "of discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he did\r\n",
      "so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted;\r\n",
      "especially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the\r\n",
      "old gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a\r\n",
      "comfortable place, without loss of time.  This led to a more friendly\r\n",
      "and confidential dialogue; from which Oliver discovered that his\r\n",
      "friend's name was Jack Dawkins, and that he was a peculiar pet and\r\n",
      "protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Dawkin's appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the\r\n",
      "comforts which his patron's interest obtained for those whom he took\r\n",
      "under his protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and dissolute\r\n",
      "mode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his intimate\r\n",
      "friends he was better known by the sobriquet of 'The Artful Dodger,'\r\n",
      "Oliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the\r\n",
      "moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon\r\n",
      "him.  Under this impression, he secretly resolved to cultivate the good\r\n",
      "opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and, if he found\r\n",
      "the Dodger incorrigible, as he more than half suspected he should, to\r\n",
      "decline the honour of his farther acquaintance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall, it\r\n",
      "was nearly eleven o'clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington.\r\n",
      "They crossed from the Angel into St. John's Road; struck down the small\r\n",
      "street which terminates at Sadler's Wells Theatre; through Exmouth\r\n",
      "Street and Coppice Row; down the little court by the side of the\r\n",
      "workhouse; across the classic ground which once bore the name of\r\n",
      "Hockley-in-the-Hole; thence into Little Saffron Hill; and so into\r\n",
      "Saffron Hill the Great: along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace,\r\n",
      "directing Oliver to follow close at his heels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of\r\n",
      "his leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either\r\n",
      "side of the way, as he passed along.  A dirtier or more wretched place\r\n",
      "he had never seen.  The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air\r\n",
      "was impregnated with filthy odours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade\r\n",
      "appeared to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were\r\n",
      "crawling in and out at the doors, or screaming from the inside.  The\r\n",
      "sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the\r\n",
      "place, were the public-houses; and in them, the lowest orders of Irish\r\n",
      "were wrangling with might and main. Covered ways and yards, which here\r\n",
      "and there diverged from the main street, disclosed little knots of\r\n",
      "houses, where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth;\r\n",
      "and from several of the door-ways, great ill-looking fellows were\r\n",
      "cautiously emerging, bound, to all appearance, on no very well-disposed\r\n",
      "or harmless errands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver was just considering whether he hadn't better run away, when\r\n",
      "they reached the bottom of the hill.  His conductor, catching him by\r\n",
      "the arm, pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane; and drawing\r\n",
      "him into the passage, closed it behind them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now, then!' cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from the\r\n",
      "Dodger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Plummy and slam!' was the reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right; for the\r\n",
      "light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the\r\n",
      "passage; and a man's face peeped out, from where a balustrade of the\r\n",
      "old kitchen staircase had been broken away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There's two on you,' said the man, thrusting the candle farther out,\r\n",
      "and shielding his eyes with his hand.  'Who's the t'other one?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A new pal,' replied Jack Dawkins, pulling Oliver forward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Where did he come from?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Greenland. Is Fagin upstairs?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, he's a sortin' the wipes.  Up with you!'  The candle was drawn\r\n",
      "back, and the face disappeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver, groping his way with one hand, and having the other firmly\r\n",
      "grasped by his companion, ascended with much difficulty the dark and\r\n",
      "broken stairs: which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition\r\n",
      "that showed he was well acquainted with them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He threw open the door of a back-room, and drew Oliver in after him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and\r\n",
      "dirt.  There was a deal table before the fire: upon which were a\r\n",
      "candle, stuck in a ginger-beer bottle, two or three pewter pots, a loaf\r\n",
      "and butter, and a plate.  In a frying-pan, which was on the fire, and\r\n",
      "which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string, some sausages were\r\n",
      "cooking; and standing over them, with a toasting-fork in his hand, was\r\n",
      "a very old shrivelled Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face\r\n",
      "was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair. He was dressed in a\r\n",
      "greasy flannel gown, with his throat bare; and seemed to be dividing\r\n",
      "his attention between the frying-pan and the clothes-horse, over which\r\n",
      "a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging.  Several rough beds\r\n",
      "made of old sacks, were huddled side by side on the floor. Seated round\r\n",
      "the table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking\r\n",
      "long clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men.\r\n",
      "These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to\r\n",
      "the Jew; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver.  So did the Jew\r\n",
      "himself, toasting-fork in hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This is him, Fagin,' said Jack Dawkins;'my friend Oliver Twist.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the\r\n",
      "hand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance.\r\n",
      "Upon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came round him, and shook\r\n",
      "both his hands very hard--especially the one in which he held his\r\n",

      "conscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in\r\n",

      "Oliver, and called him by his name. He did not answer, and was to all\r\n",
      "appearances asleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the\r\n",
      "door: which he fastened. He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver,\r\n",
      "from some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on\r\n",
      "the table. His eyes glistened as he raised the lid, and looked in.\r\n",
      "Dragging an old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a\r\n",
      "magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Aha!' said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every\r\n",
      "feature with a hideous grin. 'Clever dogs! Clever dogs! Staunch to the\r\n",
      "last! Never told the old parson where they were. Never poached upon old\r\n",
      "Fagin! And why should they? It wouldn't have loosened the knot, or kept\r\n",
      "the drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no! Fine fellows! Fine fellows!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew\r\n",
      "once more deposited the watch in its place of safety. At least half a\r\n",
      "dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed\r\n",
      "with equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other\r\n",
      "articles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly\r\n",
      "workmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of their names.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that\r\n",
      "it lay in the palm of his hand. There seemed to be some very minute\r\n",
      "inscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading\r\n",
      "it with his hand, pored over it, long and earnestly. At length he put\r\n",
      "it down, as if despairing of success; and, leaning back in his chair,\r\n",
      "muttered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What a fine thing capital punishment is! Dead men never repent; dead\r\n",
      "men never bring awkward stories to light. Ah, it's a fine thing for the\r\n",
      "trade! Five of 'em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or\r\n",
      "turn white-livered!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been\r\n",
      "staring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver's face; the boy's eyes were\r\n",
      "fixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only\r\n",
      "for an instant--for the briefest space of time that can possibly be\r\n",
      "conceived--it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on\r\n",
      "a bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up. He trembled\r\n",
      "very much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the\r\n",
      "knife quivered in the air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's that?' said the Jew. 'What do you watch me for? Why are you\r\n",
      "awake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy! Quick--quick! for your life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I wasn't able to sleep any longer, sir,' replied Oliver, meekly. 'I am\r\n",
      "very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You were not awake an hour ago?' said the Jew, scowling fiercely on\r\n",
      "the boy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No! No, indeed!' replied Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Are you sure?' cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before:\r\n",
      "and a threatening attitude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Upon my word I was not, sir,' replied Oliver, earnestly. 'I was not,\r\n",
      "indeed, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Tush, tush, my dear!' said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old manner,\r\n",
      "and playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as if to\r\n",
      "induce the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport. 'Of course I\r\n",
      "know that, my dear. I only tried to frighten you. You're a brave boy.\r\n",
      "Ha! ha! you're a brave boy, Oliver.' The Jew rubbed his hands with a\r\n",
      "chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?' said the Jew, laying\r\n",
      "his hand upon it after a short pause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah!' said the Jew, turning rather pale. 'They--they're mine, Oliver;\r\n",
      "my little property. All I have to live upon, in my old age. The folks\r\n",
      "call me a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that's all.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in\r\n",
      "such a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps\r\n",
      "his fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of\r\n",
      "money, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he\r\n",
      "might get up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Certainly, my dear, certainly,' replied the old gentleman. 'Stay.\r\n",
      "There's a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. Bring it here;\r\n",
      "and I'll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to\r\n",
      "raise the pitcher.  When he turned his head, the box was gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying\r\n",
      "the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew's directions, when\r\n",
      "the Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom\r\n",
      "Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally\r\n",
      "introduced to him as Charley Bates. The four sat down, to breakfast, on\r\n",
      "the coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought\r\n",
      "home in the crown of his hat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well,' said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing himself\r\n",
      "to the Dodger, 'I hope you've been at work this morning, my dears?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hard,' replied the Dodger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'As nails,' added Charley Bates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Good boys, good boys!' said the Jew. 'What have you got, Dodger?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A couple of pocket-books,' replied that young gentlman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Lined?' inquired the Jew, with eagerness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Pretty well,' replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books; one\r\n",
      "green, and the other red.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not so heavy as they might be,' said the Jew, after looking at the\r\n",
      "insides carefully; 'but very neat and nicely made.  Ingenious workman,\r\n",
      "ain't he, Oliver?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Very indeed, sir,' said Oliver. At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed\r\n",
      "uproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to\r\n",
      "laugh at, in anything that had passed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And what have you got, my dear?' said Fagin to Charley Bates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Wipes,' replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four\r\n",
      "pocket-handkerchiefs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well,' said the Jew, inspecting them closely; 'they're very good ones,\r\n",
      "very. You haven't marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks shall\r\n",
      "be picked out with a needle, and we'll teach Oliver how to do it. Shall\r\n",
      "us, Oliver, eh? Ha! ha! ha!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If you please, sir,' said Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You'd like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as easy as Charley\r\n",
      "Bates, wouldn't you, my dear?' said the Jew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Very much, indeed, if you'll teach me, sir,' replied Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Master Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply, that\r\n",
      "he burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he was\r\n",
      "drinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly\r\n",
      "terminated in his premature suffocation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He is so jolly green!' said Charley when he recovered, as an apology\r\n",
      "to the company for his unpolite behaviour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver's hair over his eyes,\r\n",
      "and said he'd know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman,\r\n",
      "observing Oliver's colour mounting, changed the subject by asking\r\n",
      "whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning?\r\n",
      "This made him wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies\r\n",
      "of the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver naturally\r\n",
      "wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very\r\n",
      "industrious.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentlman and the two\r\n",
      "boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed in\r\n",
      "this way. The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in one pocket of\r\n",
      "his trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat\r\n",
      "pocket, with a guard-chain round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond\r\n",
      "pin in his shirt: buttoned his coat tight round him, and putting his\r\n",
      "spectacle-case and handkerchief in his pockets, trotted up and down the\r\n",
      "room with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen\r\n",
      "walk about the streets any hour in the day.  Sometimes he stopped at\r\n",
      "the fire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he was\r\n",
      "staring with all his might into shop-windows.  At such times, he would\r\n",
      "look constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping\r\n",
      "all his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn't lost anything, in such a\r\n",
      "very funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran\r\n",
      "down his face.  All this time, the two boys followed him closely about:\r\n",
      "getting out of his sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that\r\n",
      "it was impossible to follow their motions. At last, the Dodger trod\r\n",
      "upon his toes, or ran upon his boot accidently, while Charley Bates\r\n",
      "stumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they took from\r\n",
      "him, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box, note-case,\r\n",
      "watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief, even the\r\n",
      "spectacle-case.  If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his\r\n",
      "pockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game began all over\r\n",
      "again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When this game had been played a great many times, a couple of young\r\n",
      "ladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was named Bet,\r\n",
      "and the other Nancy.  They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly\r\n",
      "turned up behind, and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings.\r\n",
      "They were not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of\r\n",
      "colour in their faces, and looked quite stout and hearty.  Being\r\n",
      "remarkably free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them\r\n",
      "very nice girls indeed.  As there is no doubt they were.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The visitors stopped a long time. Spirits were produced, in consequence\r\n",
      "of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside; and\r\n",
      "the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn. At length,\r\n",
      "Charley Bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof.\r\n",
      "This, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly\r\n",
      "afterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went\r\n",
      "away together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with\r\n",
      "money to spend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There, my dear,' said Fagin. 'That's a pleasant life, isn't it? They\r\n",
      "have gone out for the day.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Have they done work, sir?' inquired Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,' said the Jew; 'that is, unless they should unexpectedly come\r\n",
      "across any, when they are out; and they won't neglect it, if they do,\r\n",
      "my dear, depend upon it.  Make 'em your models, my dear. Make 'em your\r\n",
      "models,' tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his\r\n",
      "words; 'do everything they bid you, and take their advice in all\r\n",
      "matters--especially the Dodger's, my dear. He'll be a great man\r\n",
      "himself, and will make you one too, if you take pattern by him.--Is my\r\n",
      "handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?' said the Jew, stopping\r\n",
      "short.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, sir,' said Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'See if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw them do,\r\n",
      "when we were at play this morning.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen\r\n",
      "the Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with\r\n",
      "the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is it gone?' cried the Jew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Here it is, sir,' said Oliver, showing it in his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You're a clever boy, my dear,' said the playful old gentleman, patting\r\n",
      "Oliver on the head approvingly. 'I never saw a sharper lad. Here's a\r\n",
      "shilling for you. If you go on, in this way, you'll be the greatest man\r\n",
      "of the time. And now come here, and I'll show you how to take the marks\r\n",
      "out of the handkerchiefs.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman's pocket in play, had to\r\n",
      "do with his chances of being a great man.  But, thinking that the Jew,\r\n",
      "being so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to\r\n",
      "the table, and was soon deeply involved in his new study.\r\n",

      "For many days, Oliver remained in the Jew's room, picking the marks out\r\n",
      "of the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought\r\n",
      "home,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which\r\n",
      "the two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning. At length,\r\n",
      "he began to languish for fresh air, and took many occasions of\r\n",
      "earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work\r\n",
      "with his two companions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what\r\n",
      "he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman's character.\r\n",
      "Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty-handed,\r\n",
      "he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy\r\n",
      "habits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by\r\n",
      "sending them supperless to bed. On one occasion, indeed, he even went\r\n",
      "so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was\r\n",
      "carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so\r\n",
      "eagerly sought. There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two\r\n",
      "or three days, and the dinners had been rather meagre. Perhaps these\r\n",
      "were reasons for the old gentleman's giving his assent; but, whether\r\n",
      "they were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the\r\n",
      "joint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up,\r\n",
      "and his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his\r\n",
      "hands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they\r\n",

      "divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and\r\n",
      "thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that\r\n",
      "they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction.\r\n",
      "These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring\r\n",
      "his intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when\r\n",
      "his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very\r\n",
      "mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open\r\n",
      "square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion\r\n",
      "of terms, 'The Green': when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying\r\n",
      "his finger on his lip, drew his companions back again, with the\r\n",
      "greatest caution and circumspection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's the matter?' demanded Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hush!' replied the Dodger. 'Do you see that old cove at the\r\n",
      "book-stall?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The old gentleman over the way?' said Oliver. 'Yes, I see him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He'll do,' said the Dodger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A prime plant,' observed Master Charley Bates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he\r\n",
      "was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked\r\n",
      "stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman\r\n",
      "towards whom his attention had been directed. Oliver walked a few paces\r\n",
      "after them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood\r\n",
      "looking on in silent amazement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a\r\n",
      "powdered head and gold spectacles. He was dressed in a bottle-green\r\n",
      "coat with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a\r\n",
      "smart bamboo cane under his arm. He had taken up a book from the stall,\r\n",
      "and there he stood, reading away, as hard as if he were in his\r\n",
      "elbow-chair, in his own study. It is very possible that he fancied\r\n",
      "himself there, indeed; for it was plain, from his abstraction, that he\r\n",
      "saw not the book-stall, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short,\r\n",
      "anything but the book itself: which he was reading straight through:\r\n",
      "turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page, beginning at\r\n",
      "the top line of the next one, and going regularly on, with the greatest\r\n",
      "interest and eagerness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What was Oliver's horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking\r\n",
      "on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the\r\n",
      "Dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman's pocket, and draw from\r\n",
      "thence a handkerchief! To see him hand the same to Charley Bates; and\r\n",
      "finally to behold them, both running away round the corner at full\r\n",
      "speed!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches,\r\n",
      "and the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy's mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his\r\n",
      "veins from terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then,\r\n",
      "confused and frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he\r\n",
      "did, made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was all done in a minute's space. In the very instant when Oliver\r\n",
      "began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and\r\n",
      "missing his handkerchief, turned sharp round. Seeing the boy scudding\r\n",
      "away at such a rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the\r\n",
      "depredator; and shouting 'Stop thief!' with all his might, made off\r\n",
      "after him, book in hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the\r\n",
      "hue-and-cry. The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public\r\n",
      "attention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the\r\n",
      "very first doorway round the corner. They no sooner heard the cry, and\r\n",
      "saw Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they\r\n",
      "issued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting 'Stop thief!' too,\r\n",
      "joined in the pursuit like good citizens.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he was not\r\n",
      "theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that\r\n",
      "self-preservation is the first law of nature. If he had been, perhaps\r\n",
      "he would have been prepared for this. Not being prepared, however, it\r\n",
      "alarmed him the more; so away he went like the wind, with the old\r\n",
      "gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stop thief! Stop thief!' There is a magic in the sound. The tradesman\r\n",
      "leaves his counter, and the car-man his waggon; the butcher throws down\r\n",
      "his tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand-boy\r\n",
      "his parcels; the school-boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the\r\n",
      "child his battledore. Away they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter,\r\n",
      "slap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as\r\n",
      "they turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls:\r\n",
      "and streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the sound.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stop thief! Stop thief!' The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and\r\n",
      "the crowd accumulate at every turning. Away they fly, splashing through\r\n",
      "the mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run\r\n",
      "the people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the\r\n",
      "very thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the\r\n",
      "shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, 'Stop thief! Stop thief!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stop thief! Stop thief!' There is a passion FOR _hunting_ _something_\r\n",
      "deeply implanted in the human breast.  One wretched breathless child,\r\n",
      "panting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large\r\n",
      "drops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to\r\n",
      "make head upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track, and gain\r\n",
      "upon him every instant, they hail his decreasing strength with joy.\r\n",
      "'Stop thief!'  Ay, stop him for God's sake, were it only in mercy!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stopped at last!  A clever blow.  He is down upon the pavement; and the\r\n",
      "crowd eagerly gather round him:  each new comer, jostling and\r\n",
      "struggling with the others to catch a glimpse.  'Stand aside!'  'Give\r\n",
      "him a little air!'  'Nonsense! he don't deserve it.'  'Where's the\r\n",
      "gentleman?'  'Here his is, coming down the street.'  'Make room there\r\n",
      "for the gentleman!' 'Is this the boy, sir!'  'Yes.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth,\r\n",
      "looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when\r\n",
      "the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by\r\n",
      "the foremost of the pursuers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,' said the gentleman, 'I am afraid it is the boy.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Afraid!' murmured the crowd.  'That's a good 'un!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Poor fellow!' said the gentleman, 'he has hurt himself.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'_I_ did that, sir,' said a great lubberly fellow, stepping forward;\r\n",
      "'and preciously I cut my knuckle agin' his mouth.  I stopped him, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fellow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something for his\r\n",
      "pains; but, the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression of\r\n",
      "dislike, look anxiously round, as if he contemplated running away\r\n",
      "himself:  which it is very possible he might have attempted to do, and\r\n",
      "thus have afforded another chase, had not a police officer (who is\r\n",
      "generally the last person to arrive in such cases) at that moment made\r\n",
      "his way through the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come, get up,' said the man, roughly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It wasn't me indeed, sir.  Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,'\r\n",
      "said Oliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking round.  'They\r\n",
      "are here somewhere.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh no, they ain't,' said the officer.  He meant this to be ironical,\r\n",
      "but it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off\r\n",
      "down the first convenient court they came to.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come, get up!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Don't hurt him,' said the old gentleman, compassionately.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh no, I won't hurt him,' replied the officer, tearing his jacket half\r\n",
      "off his back, in proof thereof.  'Come, I know you; it won't do.  Will\r\n",
      "you stand upon your legs, you young devil?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his\r\n",
      "feet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar, at\r\n",
      "a rapid pace.  The gentleman walked on with them by the officer's side;\r\n",
      "and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead,\r\n",
      "and stared back at Oliver from time to time.  The boys shouted in\r\n",

      "TREATS OF MR. FANG THE POLICE MAGISTRATE; AND FURNISHES A SLIGHT\r\n",
      "SPECIMEN OF HIS MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The offence had been committed within the district, and indeed in the\r\n",
      "immediate neighborhood of, a very notorious metropolitan police office.\r\n",
      "The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two\r\n",
      "or three streets, and down a place called Mutton Hill, when he was led\r\n",
      "beneath a low archway, and up a dirty court, into this dispensary of\r\n",
      "summary justice, by the back way.  It was a small paved yard into which\r\n",
      "they turned; and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of\r\n",
      "whiskers on his face, and a bunch of keys in his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's the matter now?' said the man carelessly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A young fogle-hunter,' replied the man who had Oliver in charge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Are you the party that's been robbed, sir?' inquired the man with the\r\n",
      "keys.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, I am,' replied the old gentleman; 'but I am not sure that this\r\n",
      "boy actually took the handkerchief.  I--I would rather not press the\r\n",
      "case.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Must go before the magistrate now, sir,' replied the man. 'His worship\r\n",
      "will be disengaged in half a minute.  Now, young gallows!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he\r\n",
      "unlocked as he spoke, and which led into a stone cell.  Here he was\r\n",
      "searched; and nothing being found upon him, locked up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar, only not\r\n",
      "so light.  It was most intolerably dirty; for it was Monday morning;\r\n",
      "and it had been tenanted by six drunken people, who had been locked up,\r\n",
      "elsewhere, since Saturday night.  But this is little.  In our\r\n",
      "station-houses, men and women are every night confined on the most\r\n",
      "trivial charges--the word is worth noting--in dungeons, compared with\r\n",
      "which, those in Newgate, occupied by the most atrocious felons, tried,\r\n",
      "found guilty, and under sentence of death, are palaces. Let any one who\r\n",
      "doubts this, compare the two.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated\r\n",
      "in the lock.  He turned with a sigh to the book, which had been the\r\n",
      "innocent cause of all this disturbance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There is something in that boy's face,' said the old gentleman to\r\n",
      "himself as he walked slowly away, tapping his chin with the cover of\r\n",
      "the book, in a thoughtful manner; 'something that touches and interests\r\n",
      "me.  _Can_ he be innocent?  He looked like--Bye the bye,' exclaimed the\r\n",
      "old gentleman, halting very abruptly, and staring up into the sky,\r\n",
      "'Bless my soul!--where have I seen something like that look before?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After musing for some minutes, the old gentleman walked, with the same\r\n",
      "meditative face, into a back anteroom opening from the yard; and there,\r\n",
      "retiring into a corner, called up before his mind's eye a vast\r\n",
      "amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many\r\n",
      "years.  'No,' said the old gentleman, shaking his head; 'it must be\r\n",
      "imagination.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He wandered over them again.  He had called them into view, and it was\r\n",
      "not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them.  There\r\n",
      "were the faces of friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost\r\n",
      "strangers peering intrusively from the crowd; there were the faces of\r\n",
      "young and blooming girls that were now old women; there were faces that\r\n",
      "the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to\r\n",
      "its power, still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling\r\n",
      "back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming\r\n",
      "of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond\r\n",
      "the tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only to be\r\n",
      "set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to\r\n",
      "Heaven.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver's\r\n",
      "features bore a trace.  So, he heaved a sigh over the recollections he\r\n",
      "awakened; and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman,\r\n",
      "buried them again in the pages of the musty book.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the man\r\n",
      "with the keys to follow him into the office.  He closed his book\r\n",
      "hastily; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the\r\n",
      "renowned Mr. Fang.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall.  Mr. Fang sat\r\n",
      "behind a bar, at the upper end; and on one side the door was a sort of\r\n",
      "wooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling\r\n",
      "very much at the awfulness of the scene.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fang was a lean, long-backed, stiff-necked, middle-sized man, with\r\n",
      "no great quantity of hair, and what he had, growing on the back and\r\n",
      "sides of his head.  His face was stern, and much flushed.  If he were\r\n",
      "really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good\r\n",
      "for him, he might have brought action against his countenance for\r\n",
      "libel, and have recovered heavy damages.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old gentleman bowed respectfully; and advancing to the magistrate's\r\n",
      "desk, said, suiting the action to the word, 'That is my name and\r\n",
      "address, sir.'  He then withdrew a pace or two; and, with another\r\n",
      "polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head, waited to be questioned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment perusing a leading\r\n",
      "article in a newspaper of the morning, adverting to some recent\r\n",
      "decision of his, and commending him, for the three hundred and fiftieth\r\n",
      "time, to the special and particular notice of the Secretary of State\r\n",
      "for the Home Department.  He was out of temper; and he looked up with\r\n",
      "an angry scowl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Who are you?' said Mr. Fang.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his card.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Officer!' said Mr. Fang, tossing the card contemptuously away with the\r\n",
      "newspaper.  'Who is this fellow?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'My name, sir,' said the old gentleman, speaking _like_ a gentleman,\r\n",
      "'my name, sir, is Brownlow.  Permit me to inquire the name of the\r\n",
      "magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a\r\n",
      "respectable person, under the protection of the bench.'  Saying this,\r\n",
      "Mr. Brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person\r\n",
      "who would afford him the required information.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Officer!' said Mr. Fang, throwing the paper on one side, 'what's this\r\n",
      "fellow charged with?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He's not charged at all, your worship,' replied the officer. 'He\r\n",
      "appears against this boy, your worship.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good annoyance, and\r\n",
      "a safe one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Appears against the boy, does he?' said Mr. Fang, surveying Mr.\r\n",
      "Brownlow contemptuously from head to foot.  'Swear him!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Before I am sworn, I must beg to say one word,' said Mr. Brownlow;\r\n",
      "'and that is, that I really never, without actual experience, could\r\n",
      "have believed--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hold your tongue, sir!' said Mr. Fang, peremptorily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I will not, sir!' replied the old gentleman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hold your tongue this instant, or I'll have you turned out of the\r\n",
      "office!' said Mr. Fang.  'You're an insolent impertinent fellow.  How\r\n",
      "dare you bully a magistrate!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What!' exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Swear this person!' said Fang to the clerk.  'I'll not hear another\r\n",
      "word.  Swear him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brownlow's indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting perhaps,\r\n",
      "that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he suppressed\r\n",
      "his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now,' said Fang, 'what's the charge against this boy?  What have you\r\n",
      "got to say, sir?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I was standing at a bookstall--' Mr. Brownlow began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hold your tongue, sir,' said Mr. Fang.  'Policeman!  Where's the\r\n",
      "policeman?  Here, swear this policeman.  Now, policeman, what is this?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The policeman, with becoming humility, related how he had taken the\r\n",
      "charge; how he had searched Oliver, and found nothing on his person;\r\n",
      "and how that was all he knew about it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Are there any witnesses?' inquired Mr. Fang.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'None, your worship,' replied the policeman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning round to the\r\n",
      "prosecutor, said in a towering passion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or\r\n",
      "do you not?  You have been sworn.  Now, if you stand there, refusing to\r\n",
      "give evidence, I'll punish you for disrespect to the bench; I will,\r\n",
      "by--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By what, or by whom, nobody knows, for the clerk and jailor coughed\r\n",
      "very loud, just at the right moment; and the former dropped a heavy\r\n",
      "book upon the floor, thus preventing the word from being\r\n",
      "heard--accidently, of course.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With many interruptions, and repeated insults, Mr. Brownlow contrived\r\n",
      "to state his case;  observing that, in the surprise of the moment, he\r\n",
      "had run after the boy because he had saw him running away; and\r\n",
      "expressing his hope that, if the magistrate should believe him,\r\n",
      "although not actually the thief, to be connected with the thieves, he\r\n",
      "would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He has been hurt already,' said the old gentleman in conclusion. 'And\r\n",
      "I fear,' he added, with great energy, looking towards the bar, 'I\r\n",
      "really fear that he is ill.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh! yes, I dare say!' said Mr. Fang, with a sneer.  'Come, none of\r\n",
      "your tricks here, you young vagabond; they won't do. What's your name?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him.  He was deadly pale;\r\n",
      "and the whole place seemed turning round and round.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's your name, you hardened scoundrel?' demanded Mr. Fang.\r\n",
      "'Officer, what's his name?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was addressed to a bluff old fellow, in a striped waistcoat, who\r\n",
      "was standing by the bar.  He bent over Oliver, and repeated the\r\n",
      "inquiry; but finding him really incapable of understanding the\r\n",
      "question; and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the\r\n",
      "magistrate the more, and add to the severity of his sentence; he\r\n",
      "hazarded a guess.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He says his name's Tom White, your worship,' said the kind-hearted\r\n",
      "thief-taker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, he won't speak out, won't he?' said Fang.  'Very well, very well.\r\n",
      "Where does he live?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Where he can, your worship,' replied the officer; again pretending to\r\n",
      "receive Oliver's answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Has he any parents?' inquired Mr. Fang.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He says they died in his infancy, your worship,' replied the officer:\r\n",
      "hazarding the usual reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking\r\n",
      "round with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of\r\n",
      "water.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stuff and nonsense!' said Mr. Fang:  'don't try to make a fool of me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I think he really is ill, your worship,' remonstrated the officer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I know better,' said Mr. Fang.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Take care of him, officer,' said the old gentleman, raising his hands\r\n",
      "instinctively; 'he'll fall down.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stand away, officer,' cried Fang;  'let him, if he likes.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver availed himself of the kind permission, and fell to the floor in\r\n",
      "a fainting fit.  The men in the office looked at each other, but no one\r\n",
      "dared to stir.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I knew he was shamming,' said Fang, as if this were incontestable\r\n",
      "proof of the fact.  'Let him lie there; he'll soon be tired of that.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?'  inquired the clerk in\r\n",
      "a low voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Summarily,' replied Mr. Fang.  'He stands committed for three\r\n",
      "months--hard labour of course.  Clear the office.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were\r\n",
      "preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell; when an elderly man\r\n",
      "of decent but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black, rushed\r\n",
      "hastily into the office, and advanced towards the bench.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stop, stop!  don't take him away!  For Heaven's sake stop a moment!'\r\n",
      "cried the new comer, breathless with haste.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a\r\n",
      "summary and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the\r\n",
      "character, almost the lives, of Her Majesty's subjects, expecially of\r\n",
      "the poorer class; and although, within such walls, enough fantastic\r\n",
      "tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are\r\n",
      "closed to the public, save through the medium of the daily\r\n",
      "press.[Footnote:  Or were virtually, then.] Mr. Fang was consequently\r\n",
      "not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such\r\n",
      "irreverent disorder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What is this?  Who is this?  Turn this man out.  Clear the office!'\r\n",
      "cried Mr. Fang.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I _will_ speak,' cried the man; 'I will not be turned out.  I saw it\r\n",
      "all.  I keep the book-stall.  I demand to be sworn. I will not be put\r\n",
      "down.  Mr. Fang, you must hear me.  You must not refuse, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man was right.  His manner was determined; and the matter was\r\n",
      "growing rather too serious to be hushed up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Swear the man,' growled Mr. Fang, with a very ill grace. 'Now, man,\r\n",
      "what have you got to say?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This,' said the man:  'I saw three boys:  two others and the prisoner\r\n",
      "here:  loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman\r\n",
      "was reading.  The robbery was committed by another boy.  I saw it done;\r\n",
      "and I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it.'\r\n",
      "Having by this time recovered a little breath, the worthy book-stall\r\n",
      "keeper proceeded to relate, in a more coherent manner the exact\r\n",
      "circumstances of the robbery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why didn't you come here before?' said Fang, after a pause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I hadn't a soul to mind the shop,' replied the man.  'Everybody who\r\n",
      "could have helped me, had joined in the pursuit.  I could get nobody\r\n",
      "till five minutes ago; and I've run here all the way.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The prosecutor was reading, was he?' inquired Fang, after another\r\n",
      "pause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,' replied the man.  'The very book he has in his hand.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, that book, eh?' said Fang.  'Is it paid for?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, it is not,' replied the man, with a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Dear me, I forgot all about it!' exclaimed the absent old gentleman,\r\n",
      "innocently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy!' said Fang, with\r\n",
      "a comical effort to look humane.  'I consider, sir, that you have\r\n",
      "obtained possession of that book, under very suspicious and\r\n",
      "disreputable circumstances; and you may think yourself very fortunate\r\n",
      "that the owner of the property declines to prosecute. Let this be a\r\n",
      "lesson to you, my man, or the law will overtake you yet.  The boy is\r\n",
      "discharged.  Clear the office!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'D--n me!' cried the old gentleman, bursting out with the rage he had\r\n",
      "kept down so long, 'd--n me!   I'll--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Clear the office!' said the magistrate.  'Officers, do you hear? Clear\r\n",
      "the office!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The mandate was obeyed; and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was conveyed\r\n",
      "out, with the book in one hand, and the bamboo cane in the other:  in a\r\n",
      "perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance.  He reached the yard; and his\r\n",
      "passion vanished in a moment.  Little Oliver Twist lay on his back on\r\n",
      "the pavement, with his shirt unbuttoned, and his temples bathed with\r\n",
      "water; his face a deadly white; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole\r\n",
      "frame.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Poor boy, poor boy!' said Mr. Brownlow, bending over him. 'Call a\r\n",
      "coach, somebody, pray.  Directly!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A coach was obtained, and Oliver having been carefully laid on the\r\n",
      "seat, the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'May I accompany you?' said the book-stall keeper, looking in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bless me, yes, my dear sir,' said Mr. Brownlow quickly.  'I forgot\r\n",
      "you.  Dear, dear!  I have this unhappy book still! Jump in.  Poor\r\n",
      "fellow!  There's no time to lose.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The book-stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "CHAPTER XII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "IN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE. AND IN\r\n",
      "WHICH THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS YOUTHFUL\r\n",
      "FRIENDS.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which\r\n",
      "Oliver had traversed when he first entered London in company with the\r\n",
      "Dodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the Angel at\r\n",
      "Islington, stopped at length before a neat house, in a quiet shady\r\n",
      "street near Pentonville.  Here, a bed was prepared, without loss of\r\n",
      "time, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his young charge carefully and\r\n",
      "comfortably deposited; and here, he was tended with a kindness and\r\n",
      "solicitude that knew no bounds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of\r\n",
      "his new friends.  The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and\r\n",
      "many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy\r\n",
      "bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever.  The\r\n",
      "worm does not work more surely on the dead body, than does this slow\r\n",
      "creeping fire upon the living frame.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Weak, and thin, and pallid, he awoke at last from what seemed to have\r\n",
      "been a long and troubled dream.  Feebly raising himself in the bed,\r\n",
      "with his head resting on his trembling arm, he looked anxiously around.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What room is this?  Where have I been brought to?' said Oliver. 'This\r\n",
      "is not the place I went to sleep in.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and weak;\r\n",
      "but they were overheard at once.  The curtain at the bed's head was\r\n",
      "hastily drawn back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly and precisely\r\n",
      "dressed, rose as she undrew it, from an arm-chair close by, in which\r\n",
      "she had been sitting at needle-work.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hush, my dear,' said the old lady softly.  'You must be very quiet, or\r\n",
      "you will be ill again; and you have been very bad,--as bad as bad could\r\n",
      "be, pretty nigh.  Lie down again; there's a dear!'  With those words,\r\n",
      "the old lady very gently placed Oliver's head upon the pillow; and,\r\n",
      "smoothing back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and loving\r\n",
      "in his face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand in\r\n",
      "hers, and drawing it round his neck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Save us!' said the old lady, with tears in her eyes.  'What a grateful\r\n",
      "little dear it is.  Pretty creetur!  What would his mother feel if she\r\n",
      "had sat by him as I have, and could see him now!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Perhaps she does see me,' whispered Oliver, folding his hands\r\n",
      "together; 'perhaps she has sat by me.  I almost feel as if she had.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That was the fever, my dear,' said the old lady mildly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I suppose it was,' replied Oliver, 'because heaven is a long way off;\r\n",
      "and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor\r\n",
      "boy.  But if she knew I was ill, she must have pitied me, even there;\r\n",
      "for she was very ill herself before she died.  She can't know anything\r\n",
      "about me though,' added Oliver after a moment's silence.  'If she had\r\n",
      "seen me hurt, it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always\r\n",
      "looked sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first, and her\r\n",
      "spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were\r\n",
      "part and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver\r\n",
      "to drink; and then, patting him on the cheek, told him he must lie very\r\n",
      "quiet, or he would be ill again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the\r\n",
      "kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he\r\n",
      "was completely exhausted with what he had already said.  He soon fell\r\n",
      "into a gentle doze, from which he was awakened by the light of a\r\n",
      "candle:  which, being brought near the bed, showed him a gentleman with\r\n",
      "a very large and loud-ticking gold watch in his hand, who felt his\r\n",
      "pulse, and said he was a great deal better.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You _are_ a great deal better, are you not, my dear?' said the\r\n",
      "gentleman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, thank you, sir,' replied Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,  I know you are,' said the gentleman:  'You're hungry too, an't\r\n",
      "you?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, sir,' answered Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hem!' said the gentleman.  'No, I know you're not.  He is not hungry,\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bedwin,' said the gentleman:  looking very wise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old lady made a respectful inclination of the head, which seemed to\r\n",
      "say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man. The doctor\r\n",
      "appeared much of the same opinion himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You feel sleepy, don't you, my dear?' said the doctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, sir,' replied Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' said the doctor, with a very shrewd and satisfied look. 'You're\r\n",
      "not sleepy.  Nor thirsty.  Are you?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, sir, rather thirsty,' answered Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Just as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,' said the doctor.  'It's very natural\r\n",
      "that he should be thirsty.  You may give him a little tea, ma'am, and\r\n",
      "some dry toast without any butter.  Don't keep him too warm, ma'am; but\r\n",
      "be careful that you don't let him be too cold; will you have the\r\n",
      "goodness?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old lady dropped a curtsey.  The doctor, after tasting the cool\r\n",
      "stuff, and expressing a qualified approval of it, hurried away:  his\r\n",
      "boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went\r\n",
      "downstairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he awoke, it was nearly\r\n",
      "twelve o'clock.  The old lady tenderly bade him good-night shortly\r\n",
      "afterwards, and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just\r\n",
      "come:  bringing with her, in a little bundle, a small Prayer Book and a\r\n",
      "large nightcap. Putting the latter on her head and the former on the\r\n",
      "table, the old woman, after telling Oliver that she had come to sit up\r\n",
      "with him, drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series\r\n",
      "of short naps, chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings\r\n",
      "forward, and divers moans and chokings. These, however, had no worse\r\n",
      "effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard, and then fall asleep\r\n",
      "again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And thus the night crept slowly on.  Oliver lay awake for some time,\r\n",
      "counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the\r\n",
      "rushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with his languid\r\n",
      "eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall. The darkness and\r\n",
      "the deep stillness of the room were very solemn; as they brought into\r\n",
      "the boy's mind the thought that death had been hovering there, for many\r\n",
      "days and nights, and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his\r\n",
      "awful presence, he turned his face upon the pillow, and fervently\r\n",
      "prayed to Heaven.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Gradually, he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent\r\n",
      "suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain\r\n",
      "to wake from.  Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all\r\n",
      "the struggles and turmoils of life; to all its cares for the present;\r\n",
      "its anxieties for the future; more than all, its weary recollections of\r\n",
      "the past!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his eyes; he felt\r\n",
      "cheerful and happy.  The crisis of the disease was safely past.  He\r\n",
      "belonged to the world again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In three days' time he was able to sit in an easy-chair, well propped\r\n",
      "up with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had\r\n",
      "him carried downstairs into the little housekeeper's room, which\r\n",
      "belonged to her.  Having him set, here, by the fire-side, the good old\r\n",
      "lady sat herself down too; and, being in a state of considerable\r\n",
      "delight at seeing him so much better, forthwith began to cry most\r\n",
      "violently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Never mind me, my dear,' said the old lady; 'I'm only having a regular\r\n",
      "good cry.  There; it's all over now; and I'm quite comfortable.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You're very, very kind to me, ma'am,' said Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, never you mind that, my dear,' said the old lady; 'that's got\r\n",
      "nothing to do with your broth; and it's full time you had it; for the\r\n",
      "doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this morning; and we\r\n",
      "must get up our best looks, because the better we look, the more he'll\r\n",
      "be pleased.'  And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming\r\n",
      "up, in a little saucepan, a basin full of broth:  strong enough, Oliver\r\n",
      "thought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation\r\n",
      "strength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest\r\n",
      "computation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Are you fond of pictures, dear?' inquired the old lady, seeing that\r\n",
      "Oliver had fixed his eyes, most intently, on a portrait which hung\r\n",
      "against the wall; just opposite his chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't quite know, ma'am,' said Oliver, without taking his eyes from\r\n",
      "the canvas; 'I have seen so few that I hardly know.  What a beautiful,\r\n",
      "mild face that lady's is!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah!' said the old lady, 'painters always make ladies out prettier than\r\n",
      "they are, or they wouldn't get any custom, child. The man that invented\r\n",
      "the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never\r\n",
      "succeed; it's a deal too honest.  A deal,' said the old lady, laughing\r\n",
      "very heartily at her own acuteness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is--is that a likeness, ma'am?' said Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,' said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the broth;\r\n",
      "'that's a portrait.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Whose, ma'am?' asked Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, really, my dear, I don't know,' answered the old lady in a\r\n",
      "good-humoured manner.  'It's not a likeness of anybody that you or I\r\n",
      "know, I expect.  It seems to strike your fancy, dear.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It is so pretty,' replied Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, sure you're not afraid of it?' said the old lady: observing in\r\n",
      "great surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the\r\n",
      "painting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh no, no,' returned Oliver quickly; 'but the eyes look so sorrowful;\r\n",
      "and where I sit, they seem fixed upon me.  It makes my heart beat,'\r\n",
      "added Oliver in a low voice, 'as if it was alive, and wanted to speak\r\n",
      "to me, but couldn't.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Lord save us!' exclaimed the old lady, starting; 'don't talk in that\r\n",
      "way, child.  You're weak and nervous after your illness. Let me wheel\r\n",
      "your chair round to the other side; and then you won't see it.  There!'\r\n",
      "said the old lady, suiting the action to the word; 'you don't see it\r\n",
      "now, at all events.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver _did_ see it in his mind's eye as distinctly as if he had not\r\n",
      "altered his position; but he thought it better not to worry the kind\r\n",
      "old lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him; and Mrs. Bedwin,\r\n",
      "satisfied that he felt more comfortable, salted and broke bits of\r\n",
      "toasted bread into the broth, with all the bustle befitting so solemn a\r\n",
      "preparation. Oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition.  He\r\n",
      "had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful, when there came a soft rap at\r\n",
      "the door.  'Come in,' said the old lady; and in walked Mr. Brownlow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he had no\r\n",
      "sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead, and thrust his hands\r\n",
      "behind the skirts of his dressing-gown to take a good long look at\r\n",
      "Oliver, than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd\r\n",
      "contortions.  Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness, and\r\n",
      "made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his\r\n",
      "benefactor, which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again;\r\n",
      "and the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr. Brownlow's heart,\r\n",
      "being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane\r\n",
      "disposition, forced a supply of tears into his eyes, by some hydraulic\r\n",
      "process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a\r\n",
      "condition to explain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Poor boy, poor boy!' said Mr. Brownlow, clearing his throat. 'I'm\r\n",
      "rather hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin.  I'm afraid I have caught\r\n",
      "cold.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I hope not, sir,' said Mrs. Bedwin.  'Everything you have had, has\r\n",
      "been well aired, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't know, Bedwin.  I don't know,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'I rather\r\n",
      "think I had a damp napkin at dinner-time yesterday; but never mind\r\n",
      "that.  How do you feel, my dear?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Very happy, sir,' replied Oliver.  'And very grateful indeed, sir, for\r\n",
      "your goodness to me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Good by,' said Mr. Brownlow, stoutly.  'Have you given him any\r\n",
      "nourishment, Bedwin?  Any slops, eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,' replied Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bedwin:  drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the\r\n",
      "last word:  to intimate that between slops, and broth will compounded,\r\n",
      "there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ugh!' said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight shudder; 'a couple of glasses\r\n",
      "of port wine would have done him a great deal more good. Wouldn't they,\r\n",
      "Tom White, eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'My name is Oliver, sir,' replied the little invalid:  with a look of\r\n",
      "great astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oliver,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'Oliver what?  Oliver White, eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Queer name!' said the old gentleman.  'What made you tell the\r\n",
      "magistrate your name was White?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I never told him so, sir,' returned Oliver in amazement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked\r\n",
      "somewhat sternly in Oliver's face.  It was impossible to doubt him;\r\n",
      "there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Some mistake,' said Mr. Brownlow.  But, although his motive for\r\n",
      "looking steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the\r\n",
      "resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him\r\n",
      "so strongly, that he could not withdraw his gaze.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I hope you are not angry with me, sir?' said Oliver, raising his eyes\r\n",
      "beseechingly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no,' replied the old gentleman.  'Why! what's this?  Bedwin, look\r\n",
      "there!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke, he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver's head, and\r\n",
      "then to the boy's face.  There was its living copy. The eyes, the head,\r\n",
      "the mouth; every feature was the same. The expression was, for the\r\n",
      "instant, so precisely alike, that the minutest line seemed copied with\r\n",
      "startling accuracy!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not being\r\n",
      "strong enough to bear the start it gave him, he fainted away.  A\r\n",
      "weakness on his part, which affords the narrative an opportunity of\r\n",
      "relieving the reader from suspense, in behalf of the two young pupils\r\n",
      "of the Merry Old Gentleman; and of recording--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That when the Dodger, and his accomplished friend Master Bates, joined\r\n",
      "in the hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver's heels, in consequence\r\n",
      "of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow's personal\r\n",
      "property, as has been already described, they were actuated by a very\r\n",
      "laudable and becoming regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the\r\n",
      "freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the\r\n",
      "first and proudest boasts of a true-hearted Englishman, so, I need\r\n",
      "hardly beg the reader to observe, that this action should tend to exalt\r\n",
      "them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great\r\n",
      "a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own\r\n",
      "preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code\r\n",
      "of laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid\r\n",
      "down as the main-springs of all Nature's deeds and actions:  the said\r\n",
      "philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady's proceedings to\r\n",
      "matters of maxim and theory:  and, by a very neat and pretty compliment\r\n",
      "to her exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight\r\n",
      "any considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling. For,\r\n",
      "these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by\r\n",
      "universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and\r\n",
      "weaknesses of her sex.\r\n",

      "If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of\r\n",
      "the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate\r\n",
      "predicament, I should at once find it in the fact (also recorded in a\r\n",
      "foregoing part of this narrative), of their quitting the pursuit, when\r\n",
      "the general attention was fixed upon Oliver; and making immediately for\r\n",
      "their home by the shortest possible cut.  Although I do not mean to\r\n",
      "assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages,\r\n",
      "to shorten the road to any great conclusion (their course indeed being\r\n",
      "rather to lengthen the distance, by various circumlocutions and\r\n",
      "discursive staggerings, like unto those in which drunken men under the\r\n",
      "pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas, are prone to indulge); still, I\r\n",
      "do mean to say, and do say distinctly, that it is the invariable\r\n",
      "practice of many mighty philosophers, in carrying out their theories,\r\n",
      "to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every\r\n",
      "possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect\r\n",
      "themselves.  Thus, to do a great right, you may do a little wrong; and\r\n",
      "you may take any means which the end to be attained, will justify; the\r\n",
      "amount of the right, or the amount of the wrong, or indeed the\r\n",
      "distinction between the two, being left entirely to the philosopher\r\n",
      "concerned, to be settled and determined by his clear, comprehensive,\r\n",
      "and impartial view of his own particular case.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not until the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity, through\r\n",
      "a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured\r\n",
      "to halt beneath a low and dark archway.  Having remained silent here,\r\n",
      "just long enough to recover breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an\r\n",
      "exclamation of amusement and delight; and, bursting into an\r\n",
      "uncontrollable fit of laughter, flung himself upon a doorstep, and\r\n",
      "rolled thereon in a transport of mirth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's the matter?' inquired the Dodger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ha! ha! ha!' roared Charley Bates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hold your noise,' remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round.\r\n",
      "'Do you want to be grabbed, stupid?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I can't help it,' said Charley, 'I can't help it!  To see him\r\n",
      "splitting away at that pace, and cutting round the corners, and\r\n",
      "knocking up again' the posts, and starting on again as if he was made\r\n",
      "of iron as well as them, and me with the wipe in my pocket, singing out\r\n",
      "arter him--oh, my eye!' The vivid imagination of Master Bates presented\r\n",
      "the scene before him in too strong colours.  As he arrived at this\r\n",
      "apostrophe, he again rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than\r\n",
      "before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What'll Fagin say?' inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next\r\n",
      "interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the\r\n",
      "question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What?' repeated Charley Bates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah, what?' said the Dodger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, what should he say?' inquired Charley:  stopping rather suddenly\r\n",
      "in his merriment; for the Dodger's manner was impressive.  'What should\r\n",
      "he say?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his hat,\r\n",

      "countenance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was explanatory, but not satisfactory.  Master Bates felt it so;\r\n",
      "and again said, 'What do you mean?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Dodger made no reply; but putting his hat on again, and gathering\r\n",
      "the skirts of his long-tailed coat under his arm, thrust his tongue\r\n",
      "into his cheek, slapped the bridge of his nose some half-dozen times in\r\n",
      "a familiar but expressive manner, and turning on his heel, slunk down\r\n",
      "the court.  Master Bates followed, with a thoughtful countenance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the\r\n",
      "occurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he\r\n",
      "sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand; a\r\n",
      "pocket-knife in his right; and a pewter pot on the trivet.  There was a\r\n",
      "rascally smile on his white face as he turned round, and looking\r\n",
      "sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows, bent his ear towards the\r\n",
      "door, and listened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, how's this?' muttered the Jew:  changing countenance; 'only two\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The footsteps approached nearer; they reached the landing. The door was\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'That's very likely,' returned Sikes with a malicious grin. 'You're\r\n",
      "blowed upon, Fagin.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And I'm afraid, you see,' added the Jew, speaking as if he had not\r\n",
      "noticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he did\r\n",
      "so,--'I'm afraid that, if the game was up with us, it might be up with\r\n",
      "a good many more, and that it would come out rather worse for you than\r\n",
      "it would for me, my dear.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man started, and turned round upon the Jew.  But the old\r\n",
      "gentleman's shoulders were shrugged up to his ears; and his eyes were\r\n",
      "vacantly staring on the opposite wall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a long pause. Every member of the respectable coterie\r\n",
      "appeared plunged in his own reflections; not excepting the dog, who by\r\n",
      "a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an\r\n",
      "attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter\r\n",
      "in the streets when he went out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Somebody must find out wot's been done at the office,' said Mr. Sikes\r\n",
      "in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew nodded assent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If he hasn't peached, and is committed, there's no fear till he comes\r\n",
      "out again,' said Mr. Sikes, 'and then he must be taken care on.  You\r\n",
      "must get hold of him somehow.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again the Jew nodded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The prudence of this line of action, indeed, was obvious; but,\r\n",
      "unfortunately, there was one very strong objection to its being\r\n",
      "adopted.  This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and\r\n",
      "Mr. William Sikes, happened, one and all, to entertain a violent and\r\n",
      "deeply-rooted antipathy to going near a police-office on any ground or\r\n",
      "pretext whatever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of\r\n",
      "uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult to\r\n",
      "guess.  It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject,\r\n",
      "however; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver\r\n",
      "had seen on a former occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The very thing!' said the Jew.  'Bet will go; won't you, my dear?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Wheres?' inquired the young lady.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Only just up to the office, my dear,' said the Jew coaxingly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm\r\n",
      "that she would not, but that she merely expressed an emphatic and\r\n",
      "earnest desire to be 'blessed' if she would; a polite and delicate\r\n",
      "evasion of the request, which shows the young lady to have been\r\n",
      "possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict\r\n",
      "upon a fellow-creature, the pain of a direct and pointed refusal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew's countenance fell.  He turned from this young lady, who was\r\n",
      "gaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green boots, and\r\n",
      "yellow curl-papers, to the other female.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nancy, my dear,' said the Jew in a soothing manner, 'what do YOU say?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That it won't do; so it's no use a-trying it on, Fagin,' replied Nancy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What do you mean by that?' said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly\r\n",
      "manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What I say, Bill,' replied the lady collectedly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, you're just the very person for it,' reasoned Mr. Sikes: 'nobody\r\n",
      "about here knows anything of you.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And as I don't want 'em to, neither,' replied Nancy in the same\r\n",
      "composed manner, 'it's rather more no than yes with me, Bill.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She'll go, Fagin,' said Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, she won't, Fagin,' said Nancy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, she will, Fagin,' said Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Mr. Sikes was right.  By dint of alternate threats, promises, and\r\n",
      "bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake\r\n",
      "the commission.  She was not, indeed, withheld by the same\r\n",
      "considerations as her agreeable friend; for, having recently removed\r\n",
      "into the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel suburb\r\n",
      "of Ratcliffe, she was not under the same apprehension of being\r\n",
      "recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her\r\n",
      "curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,--both articles of dress\r\n",
      "being provided from the Jew's inexhaustible stock,--Miss Nancy prepared\r\n",
      "to issue forth on her errand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stop a minute, my dear,' said the Jew, producing, a little covered\r\n",
      "basket.  'Carry that in one hand.  It looks more respectable, my dear.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Give her a door-key to carry in her t'other one, Fagin,' said Sikes;\r\n",
      "'it looks real and genivine like.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, yes, my dear, so it does,' said the Jew, hanging a large\r\n",
      "street-door key on the forefinger of the young lady's right hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There; very good!  Very good indeed, my dear!' said the Jew, rubbing\r\n",
      "his hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, my brother!  My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!'\r\n",
      "exclaimed Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket\r\n",
      "and the street-door key in an agony of distress.  'What has become of\r\n",
      "him!  Where have they taken him to!  Oh, do have pity, and tell me\r\n",
      "what's been done with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you\r\n",
      "please, gentlemen!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart-broken tone:\r\n",
      "to the immeasurable delight of her hearers:  Miss Nancy paused, winked\r\n",
      "to the company, nodded smilingly round, and disappeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah, she's a clever girl, my dears,' said the Jew, turning round to his\r\n",
      "young friends, and shaking his head gravely, as if in mute admonition\r\n",
      "to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She's a honour to her sex,' said Mr. Sikes, filling his glass, and\r\n",
      "smiting the table with his enormous fist.  'Here's her health, and\r\n",
      "wishing they was all like her!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While these, and many other encomiums, were being passed on the\r\n",
      "accomplished Nancy, that young lady made the best of her way to the\r\n",
      "police-office; whither, notwithstanding a little natural timidity\r\n",
      "consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected, she\r\n",
      "arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Entering by the back way, she tapped softly with the key at one of the\r\n",
      "cell-doors, and listened.  There was no sound within:  so she coughed\r\n",
      "and listened again.  Still there was no reply:  so she spoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nolly, dear?' murmured Nancy in a gentle voice; 'Nolly?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who had been\r\n",
      "taken up for playing the flute, and who, the offence against society\r\n",
      "having been clearly proved, had been very properly committed by Mr.\r\n",
      "Fang to the House of Correction for one month; with the appropriate and\r\n",
      "amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare, it would be\r\n",
      "more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical\r\n",
      "instrument.  He made no answer: being occupied mentally bewailing the\r\n",
      "loss of the flute, which had been confiscated for the use of the\r\n",
      "county:  so Nancy passed on to the next cell, and knocked there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well!' cried a faint and feeble voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is there a little boy here?' inquired Nancy, with a preliminary sob.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' replied the voice; 'God forbid.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a vagrant of sixty-five, who was going to prison for _not_\r\n",
      "playing the flute; or, in other words, for begging in the streets, and\r\n",
      "doing nothing for his livelihood.  In the next cell was another man,\r\n",
      "who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without\r\n",
      "license; thereby doing something for his living, in defiance of the\r\n",
      "Stamp-office.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or\r\n",
      "knew anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in\r\n",
      "the striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and\r\n",
      "lamentations, rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of\r\n",
      "the street-door key and the little basket, demanded her own dear\r\n",
      "brother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I haven't got him, my dear,' said the old man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Where is he?' screamed Nancy, in a distracted manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, the gentleman's got him,' replied the officer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What gentleman!  Oh, gracious heavens!  What gentleman?' exclaimed\r\n",
      "Nancy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed the\r\n",
      "deeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office,\r\n",
      "and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to\r\n",
      "have been committed by another boy, not in custody; and that the\r\n",
      "prosecutor had carried him away, in an insensible condition, to his own\r\n",
      "residence:  of and concerning which, all the informant knew was, that\r\n",
      "it was somewhere in Pentonville, he having heard that word mentioned in\r\n",
      "the directions to the coachman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young woman\r\n",
      "staggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her faltering walk for a\r\n",
      "swift run, returned by the most devious and complicated route she could\r\n",
      "think of, to the domicile of the Jew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered,\r\n",
      "than he very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his hat,\r\n",
      "expeditiously departed:  without devoting any time to the formality of\r\n",
      "wishing the company good-morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We must know where he is, my dears; he must be found,' said the Jew\r\n",
      "greatly excited.  'Charley, do nothing but skulk about, till you bring\r\n",
      "home some news of him!  Nancy, my dear, I must have him found.  I trust\r\n",
      "to you, my dear,--to you and the Artful for everything!  Stay, stay,'\r\n",
      "added the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand; 'there's money,\r\n",
      "my dears.  I shall shut up this shop to-night.  You'll know where to\r\n",
      "find me!  Don't stop here a minute.  Not an instant, my dears!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words, he pushed them from the room:  and carefully\r\n",
      "double-locking and barring the door behind them, drew from its place of\r\n",
      "concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver.\r\n",
      "Then, he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath\r\n",
      "his clothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A rap at the door startled him in this occupation.  'Who's there?' he\r\n",
      "cried in a shrill tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Me!' replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key-hole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What now?' cried the Jew impatiently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is he to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?' inquired the\r\n",
      "Dodger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,' replied the Jew, 'wherever she lays hands on him.  Find him,\r\n",
      "find him out, that's all.  I shall know what to do next; never fear.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boy murmured a reply of intelligence:  and hurried downstairs after\r\n",
      "his companions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He has not peached so far,' said the Jew as he pursued his occupation.\r\n",

      "COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER'S STAY AT MR. BROWNLOW'S, WITH\r\n",
      "THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG UTTERED CONCERNING HIM,\r\n",
      "WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver soon recovering from the fainting-fit into which Mr. Brownlow's\r\n",
      "abrupt exclamation had thrown him, the subject of the picture was\r\n",
      "carefully avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin, in the\r\n",
      "conversation that ensued:  which indeed bore no reference to Oliver's\r\n",
      "history or prospects, but was confined to such topics as might amuse\r\n",
      "without exciting him.  He was still too weak to get up to breakfast;\r\n",
      "but, when he came down into the housekeeper's room next day, his first\r\n",
      "act was to cast an eager glance at the wall, in the hope of again\r\n",
      "looking on the face of the beautiful lady.  His expectations were\r\n",
      "disappointed, however, for the picture had been removed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah!' said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver's eyes.\r\n",
      "'It is gone, you see.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I see it is ma'am,' replied Oliver.  'Why have they taken it away?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that as it\r\n",
      "seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting well, you\r\n",
      "know,' rejoined the old lady.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, no, indeed.  It didn't worry me, ma'am,' said Oliver. 'I liked to\r\n",
      "see it.  I quite loved it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, well!' said the old lady, good-humouredly; 'you get well as fast\r\n",
      "as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again. There!  I promise\r\n",
      "you that!  Now, let us talk about something else.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at\r\n",
      "that time.  As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness, he\r\n",
      "endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he listened\r\n",
      "attentively to a great many stories she told him, about an amiable and\r\n",
      "handsome daughter of hers, who was married to an amiable and handsome\r\n",
      "man, and lived in the country; and about a son, who was clerk to a\r\n",
      "merchant in the West Indies; and who was, also, such a good young man,\r\n",
      "and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a-year, that it brought\r\n",
      "the tears into her eyes to talk about them.  When the old lady had\r\n",
      "expatiated, a long time, on the excellences of her children, and the\r\n",
      "merits of her kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gone,\r\n",
      "poor dear soul! just six-and-twenty years, it was time to have tea.\r\n",
      "After tea she began to teach Oliver cribbage: which he learnt as\r\n",
      "quickly as she could teach:  and at which game they played, with great\r\n",
      "interest and gravity, until it was time for the invalid to have some\r\n",
      "warm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and then to go cosily\r\n",
      "to bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were happy days, those of Oliver's recovery.  Everything was so\r\n",
      "quiet, and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after\r\n",
      "the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived, it\r\n",
      "seemed like Heaven itself.  He was no sooner strong enough to put his\r\n",
      "clothes on, properly, than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and\r\n",
      "a new cap, and a new pair of shoes, to be provided for him.  As Oliver\r\n",
      "was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes, he gave\r\n",
      "them to a servant who had been very kind to him, and asked her to sell\r\n",
      "them to a Jew, and keep the money for herself.  This she very readily\r\n",
      "did; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew\r\n",
      "roll them up in his bag and walk away, he felt quite delighted to think\r\n",
      "that they were safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger\r\n",
      "of his ever being able to wear them again.  They were sad rags, to tell\r\n",
      "the truth; and Oliver had never had a new suit before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he was\r\n",
      "sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr.\r\n",
      "Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see\r\n",
      "him in his study, and talk to him a little while.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bless us, and save us!  Wash your hands, and let me part your hair\r\n",
      "nicely for you, child,' said Mrs. Bedwin.  'Dear heart alive!  If we\r\n",
      "had known he would have asked for you, we would have put you a clean\r\n",
      "collar on, and made you as smart as sixpence!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver did as the old lady bade him; and, although she lamented\r\n",
      "grievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little\r\n",
      "frill that bordered his shirt-collar; he looked so delicate and\r\n",
      "handsome, despite that important personal advantage, that she went so\r\n",
      "far as to say:  looking at him with great complacency from head to\r\n",
      "foot, that she really didn't think it would have been possible, on the\r\n",
      "longest notice, to have made much difference in him for the better.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door.  On Mr. Brownlow\r\n",
      "calling to him to come in, he found himself in a little back room,\r\n",
      "quite full of books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little\r\n",
      "gardens.  There was a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr.\r\n",
      "Brownlow was seated reading.  When he saw Oliver, he pushed the book\r\n",
      "away from him, and told him to come near the table, and sit down.\r\n",
      "Oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read\r\n",
      "such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world\r\n",
      "wiser.  Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver\r\n",
      "Twist, every day of their lives.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There are a good many books, are there not, my boy?' said Mr.\r\n",
      "Brownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the\r\n",
      "shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A great number, sir,' replied Oliver.  'I never saw so many.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You shall read them, if you behave well,' said the old gentleman\r\n",
      "kindly; 'and you will like that, better than looking at the\r\n",
      "outsides,--that is, some cases; because there are books of which the\r\n",
      "backs and covers are by far the best parts.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,' said Oliver, pointing to\r\n",
      "some large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the binding.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not always those,' said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head,\r\n",
      "and smiling as he did so; 'there are other equally heavy ones, though\r\n",
      "of a much smaller size.  How should you like to grow up a clever man,\r\n",
      "and write books, eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I think I would rather read them, sir,' replied Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What! wouldn't you like to be a book-writer?' said the old gentleman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver considered a little while; and at last said, he should think it\r\n",
      "would be a much better thing to be a book-seller; upon which the old\r\n",
      "gentleman laughed heartily, and declared he had said a very good thing.\r\n",
      "Which Oliver felt glad to have done, though he by no means knew what it\r\n",
      "was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, well,' said the old gentleman, composing his features. 'Don't be\r\n",
      "afraid!  We won't make an author of you, while there's an honest trade\r\n",
      "to be learnt, or brick-making to turn to.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Thank you, sir,' said Oliver.  At the earnest manner of his reply, the\r\n",
      "old gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious\r\n",
      "instinct, which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great attention\r\n",
      "to.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now,' said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but at the\r\n",
      "same time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had ever known him\r\n",
      "assume yet, 'I want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am\r\n",
      "going to say.  I shall talk to you without any reserve; because I am\r\n",
      "sure you are well able to understand me, as many older persons would\r\n",
      "be.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, don't tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!' exclaimed\r\n",
      "Oliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman's\r\n",
      "commencement!  'Don't turn me out of doors to wander in the streets\r\n",
      "again.  Let me stay here, and be a servant.  Don't send me back to the\r\n",
      "wretched place I came from.  Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'My dear child,' said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of\r\n",
      "Oliver's sudden appeal; 'you need not be afraid of my deserting you,\r\n",
      "unless you give me cause.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I never, never will, sir,' interposed Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I hope not,' rejoined the old gentleman.  'I do not think you ever\r\n",
      "will.  I have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I have\r\n",
      "endeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you,\r\n",
      "nevertheless; and I am more interested in your behalf than I can well\r\n",
      "account for, even to myself.  The persons on whom I have bestowed my\r\n",
      "dearest love, lie deep in their graves; but, although the happiness and\r\n",
      "delight of my life lie buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my\r\n",
      "heart, and sealed it up, forever, on my best affections.  Deep\r\n",
      "affliction has but strengthened and refined them.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the old gentleman said this in a low voice:  more to himself than to\r\n",
      "his companion:  and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards:\r\n",
      "Oliver sat quite still.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, well!' said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful\r\n",
      "tone, 'I only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing\r\n",
      "that I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful,\r\n",
      "perhaps, not to wound me again.  You say you are an orphan, without a\r\n",
      "friend in the world; all the inquiries I have been able to make,\r\n",
      "confirm the statement.  Let me hear your story; where you come from;\r\n",
      "who brought you up; and how you got into the company in which I found\r\n",
      "you.  Speak the truth, and you shall not be friendless while I live.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver's sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on\r\n",
      "the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the\r\n",
      "farm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly\r\n",
      "impatient little double-knock was heard at the street-door:  and the\r\n",
      "servant, running upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is he coming up?' inquired Mr. Brownlow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, sir,' replied the servant.  'He asked if there were any muffins\r\n",
      "in the house; and, when I told him yes, he said he had come to tea.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was\r\n",
      "an old friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little rough in\r\n",
      "his manners; for he was a worthy creature at bottom, as he had reason\r\n",
      "to know.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Shall I go downstairs, sir?' inquired Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' replied Mr. Brownlow, 'I would rather you remained here.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment, there walked into the room:  supporting himself by a\r\n",
      "thick stick:  a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was\r\n",
      "dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and\r\n",
      "gaiters, and a broad-brimmed white hat, with the sides turned up with\r\n",
      "green.  A very small-plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat;\r\n",
      "and a very long steel watch-chain, with nothing but a key at the end,\r\n",
      "dangled loosely below it.  The ends of his white neckerchief were\r\n",
      "twisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety of shapes\r\n",
      "into which his countenance was twisted, defy description.  He had a\r\n",
      "manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke; and of looking\r\n",
      "out of the corners of his eyes at the same time:  which irresistibly\r\n",
      "reminded the beholder of a parrot.  In this attitude, he fixed himself,\r\n",
      "the moment he made his appearance; and, holding out a small piece of\r\n",
      "orange-peel at arm's length, exclaimed, in a growling, discontented\r\n",
      "voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Look here! do you see this!  Isn't it a most wonderful and\r\n",
      "extraordinary thing that I can't call at a man's house but I find a\r\n",
      "piece of this poor surgeon's friend on the staircase? I've been lamed\r\n",
      "with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my death, or I'll\r\n",
      "be content to eat my own head, sir!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed\r\n",
      "nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his\r\n",
      "case, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility\r\n",
      "of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable\r\n",
      "a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed,\r\n",
      "Mr. Grimwig's head was such a particularly large one, that the most\r\n",
      "sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get\r\n",
      "through it at a sitting--to put entirely out of the question, a very\r\n",
      "thick coating of powder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'll eat my head, sir,' repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his stick upon\r\n",
      "the ground.  'Hallo! what's that!' looking at Oliver, and retreating a\r\n",
      "pace or two.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,' said Mr.\r\n",
      "Brownlow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver bowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You don't mean to say that's the boy who had the fever, I hope?' said\r\n",
      "Mr. Grimwig, recoiling a little more.  'Wait a minute! Don't speak!\r\n",
      "Stop--' continued Mr. Grimwig, abruptly, losing all dread of the fever\r\n",
      "in his triumph at the discovery; 'that's the boy who had the orange!\r\n",
      "If that's not the boy, sir, who had the orange, and threw this bit of\r\n",
      "peel upon the staircase, I'll eat my head, and his too.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no, he has not had one,' said Mr. Brownlow, laughing. 'Come!  Put\r\n",
      "down your hat; and speak to my young friend.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I feel strongly on this subject, sir,' said the irritable old\r\n",
      "gentleman, drawing off his gloves.  'There's always more or less\r\n",
      "orange-peel on the pavement in our street; and I _know_ it's put there\r\n",
      "by the surgeon's boy at the corner.  A young woman stumbled over a bit\r\n",
      "last night, and fell against my garden-railings; directly she got up I\r\n",
      "saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime-light.\r\n",
      "\"Don't go to him,\" I called out of the window, \"he's an assassin!  A\r\n",
      "man-trap!\"  So he is.  If he is not--'  Here the irascible old\r\n",
      "gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick; which was\r\n",
      "always understood, by his friends, to imply the customary offer,\r\n",
      "whenever it was not expressed in words. Then, still keeping his stick\r\n",
      "in his hand, he sat down; and, opening a double eye-glass, which he\r\n",
      "wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver:  who,\r\n",
      "seeing that he was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's the boy, is it?' said Mr. Grimwig, at length.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's the boy,' replied Mr. Brownlow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'How are you, boy?' said Mr. Grimwig.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A great deal better, thank you, sir,' replied Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about\r\n",
      "to say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the\r\n",
      "visitor's manner, he was very happy to do.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He is a nice-looking boy, is he not?' inquired Mr. Brownlow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't know,' replied Mr. Grimwig, pettishly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Don't know?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No.  I don't know.  I never see any difference in boys.  I only knew\r\n",
      "two sort of boys.  Mealy boys, and beef-faced boys.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And which is Oliver?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mealy.  I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy; a fine boy, they\r\n",
      "call him; with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid\r\n",
      "boy; with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams\r\n",
      "of his blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a\r\n",
      "wolf.  I know him!  The wretch!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'these are not the characteristics of young\r\n",
      "Oliver Twist; so he needn't excite your wrath.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'They are not,' replied Mr. Grimwig.  'He may have worse.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here, Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford Mr.\r\n",
      "Grimwig the most exquisite delight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He may have worse, I say,' repeated Mr. Grimwig.  'Where does he come\r\n",
      "from!  Who is he?  What is he?  He has had a fever.  What of that?\r\n",
      "Fevers are not peculiar to good people; are they?  Bad people have\r\n",
      "fevers sometimes; haven't they, eh?  I knew a man who was hung in\r\n",
      "Jamaica for murdering his master.  He had had a fever six times; he\r\n",
      "wasn't recommended to mercy on that account.  Pooh! nonsense!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr.\r\n",
      "Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver's appearance and\r\n",
      "manner were unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for\r\n",
      "contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the\r\n",
      "orange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to\r\n",
      "him whether a boy was well-looking or not, he had resolved, from the\r\n",
      "first, to oppose his friend.  When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one\r\n",
      "point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he\r\n",
      "had postponed any investigation into Oliver's previous history until he\r\n",
      "thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled\r\n",
      "maliciously.  And he demanded, with a sneer, whether the housekeeper\r\n",
      "was in the habit of counting the plate at night; because if she didn't\r\n",
      "find a table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he would\r\n",
      "be content to--and so forth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous\r\n",
      "gentleman:  knowing his friend's peculiarities, bore with great good\r\n",
      "humour; as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to express his\r\n",
      "entire approval of the muffins, matters went on very smoothly; and\r\n",
      "Oliver, who made one of the party, began to feel more at his ease than\r\n",
      "he had yet done in the fierce old gentleman's presence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of\r\n",
      "the life and adventures of Oliver Twist?' asked Grimwig of Mr.\r\n",
      "Brownlow, at the conclusion of the meal; looking sideways at Oliver, as\r\n",
      "he resumed his subject.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'To-morrow morning,' replied Mr. Brownlow.  'I would rather he was\r\n",
      "alone with me at the time.  Come up to me to-morrow morning at ten\r\n",
      "o'clock, my dear.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver.  He answered with some hesitation, because\r\n",
      "he was confused by Mr. Grimwig's looking so hard at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'll tell you what,' whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow; 'he\r\n",
      "won't come up to you to-morrow morning.  I saw him hesitate. He is\r\n",
      "deceiving you, my good friend.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'll swear he is not,' replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If he is not,' said Mr. Grimwig, 'I'll--' and down went the stick.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'll answer for that boy's truth with my life!' said Mr. Brownlow,\r\n",
      "knocking the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And I for his falsehood with my head!' rejoined Mr. Grimwig, knocking\r\n",
      "the table also.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We shall see,' said Mr. Brownlow, checking his rising anger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We will,' replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile;  'we will.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this moment,\r\n",
      "a small parcel of books, which Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased\r\n",
      "of the identical bookstall-keeper, who has already figured in this\r\n",
      "history; having laid them on the table, she prepared to leave the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin!' said Mr. Brownlow; 'there is something to\r\n",
      "go back.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He has gone, sir,' replied Mrs. Bedwin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Call after him,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'it's particular.  He is a poor\r\n",
      "man, and they are not paid for.  There are some books to be taken back,\r\n",
      "too.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The street-door was opened.  Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran\r\n",
      "another; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy;\r\n",
      "but there was no boy in sight.  Oliver and the girl returned, in a\r\n",
      "breathless state, to report that there were no tidings of him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Dear me, I am very sorry for that,' exclaimed Mr. Brownlow; 'I\r\n",
      "particularly wished those books to be returned to-night.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Send Oliver with them,' said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical smile; 'he\r\n",
      "will be sure to deliver them safely, you know.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,' said Oliver. 'I'll run\r\n",
      "all the way, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out\r\n",
      "on any account; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined\r\n",
      "him that he should; and that, by his prompt discharge of the\r\n",
      "commission, he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions:  on\r\n",
      "this head at least:  at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You _shall_ go, my dear,' said the old gentleman.  'The books are on a\r\n",
      "chair by my table.  Fetch them down.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his arm in\r\n",
      "a great bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he was to\r\n",
      "take.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You are to say,' said Mr. Brownlow, glancing steadily at Grimwig; 'you\r\n",
      "are to say that you have brought those books back; and that you have\r\n",
      "come to pay the four pound ten I owe him.  This is a five-pound note,\r\n",
      "so you will have to bring me back, ten shillings change.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I won't be ten minutes, sir,' said Oliver, eagerly.  Having buttoned\r\n",
      "up the bank-note in his jacket pocket, and placed the books carefully\r\n",
      "under his arm, he made a respectful bow, and left the room.  Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bedwin followed him to the street-door, giving him many directions\r\n",
      "about the nearest way, and the name of the bookseller, and the name of\r\n",
      "the street:  all of which Oliver said he clearly understood.  Having\r\n",
      "superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold, the old lady\r\n",
      "at length permitted him to depart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bless his sweet face!' said the old lady, looking after him. 'I can't\r\n",
      "bear, somehow, to let him go out of my sight.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he turned\r\n",
      "the corner.  The old lady smilingly returned his salutation, and,\r\n",
      "closing the door, went back to her own room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Let me see; he'll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,' said Mr.\r\n",
      "Brownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it on the table.  'It will\r\n",
      "be dark by that time.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh! you really expect him to come back, do you?' inquired Mr. Grimwig.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Don't you?' asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig's breast, at the\r\n",
      "moment; and it was rendered stronger by his friend's confident smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' he said, smiting the table with his fist, 'I do not. The boy has\r\n",
      "a new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable books under his\r\n",
      "arm, and a five-pound note in his pocket.  He'll join his old friends\r\n",
      "the thieves, and laugh at you.  If ever that boy returns to this house,\r\n",
      "sir, I'll eat my head.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words he drew his chair closer to the table; and there the\r\n",
      "two friends sat, in silent expectation, with the watch between them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our\r\n",
      "own judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and\r\n",
      "hasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a\r\n",
      "bad-hearted man, and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see\r\n",
      "his respected friend duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly\r\n",
      "and strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It grew so dark, that the figures on the dial-plate were scarcely\r\n",
      "discernible; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in\r\n",
      "silence, with the watch between them.\r\n",

      "SHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY\r\n",
      "WERE\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of\r\n",
      "Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light\r\n",
      "burnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in\r\n",
      "the summer:  there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a\r\n",
      "small glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a\r\n",
      "velveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by\r\n",
      "that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated\r\n",
      "to recognise as Mr. William Sikes.  At his feet, sat a white-coated,\r\n",
      "red-eyed dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his\r\n",
      "master with both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh\r\n",
      "cut on one side of his mouth, which appeared to be the result of some\r\n",
      "recent conflict.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Keep quiet, you warmint!  Keep quiet!' said Mr. Sikes, suddenly\r\n",
      "breaking silence.  Whether his meditations were so intense as to be\r\n",
      "disturbed by the dog's winking, or whether his feelings were so wrought\r\n",
      "upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable\r\n",
      "from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for\r\n",
      "argument and consideration.  Whatever was the cause, the effect was a\r\n",
      "kick and a curse, bestowed upon the dog simultaneously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by\r\n",
      "their masters; but Mr. Sikes's dog, having faults of temper in common\r\n",
      "with his owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a\r\n",
      "powerful sense of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth\r\n",
      "in one of the half-boots.  Having given in a hearty shake, he retired,\r\n",
      "growling, under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr.\r\n",
      "Sikes levelled at his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You would, would you?' said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand, and\r\n",
      "deliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife, which he drew\r\n",
      "from his pocket.  'Come here, you born devil!  Come here!  D'ye hear?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest\r\n",
      "key of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some\r\n",
      "unaccountable objection to having his throat cut, he remained where he\r\n",
      "was, and growled more fiercely than before:  at the same time grasping\r\n",
      "the end of the poker between his teeth, and biting at it like a wild\r\n",
      "beast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping on\r\n",
      "his knees, began to assail the animal most furiously.  The dog jumped\r\n",
      "from right to left, and from left to right; snapping, growling, and\r\n",
      "barking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the\r\n",
      "struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the\r\n",
      "door suddenly opening, the dog darted out:  leaving Bill Sikes with the\r\n",
      "poker and the clasp-knife in his hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage.  Mr.\r\n",
      "Sikes, being disappointed of the dog's participation, at once\r\n",
      "transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?' said Sikes,\r\n",
      "with a fierce gesture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I didn't know, my dear, I didn't know,' replied Fagin, humbly; for the\r\n",
      "Jew was the new comer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Didn't know, you white-livered thief!' growled Sikes. 'Couldn't you\r\n",
      "hear the noise?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not a sound of it, as I'm a living man, Bill,' replied the Jew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh no!  You hear nothing, you don't,' retorted Sikes with a fierce\r\n",
      "sneer.  'Sneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or go!  I\r\n",
      "wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why?' inquired the Jew with a forced smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as\r\n",
      "haven't half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he likes,'\r\n",
      "replied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look;\r\n",
      "'that's why.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to\r\n",
      "laugh at the pleasantry of his friend.  He was obviously very ill at\r\n",
      "ease, however.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Grin away,' said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him with\r\n",
      "savage contempt; 'grin away.  You'll never have the laugh at me,\r\n",
      "though, unless it's behind a nightcap.  I've got the upper hand over\r\n",
      "you, Fagin; and, d--me, I'll keep it.  There!  If I go, you go; so take\r\n",
      "care of me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, well, my dear,' said the Jew, 'I know all that; we--we--have a\r\n",
      "mutual interest, Bill,--a mutual interest.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Humph,' said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on\r\n",
      "the Jew's side than on his.  'Well, what have you got to say to me?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's all passed safe through the melting-pot,' replied Fagin, 'and\r\n",
      "this is your share.  It's rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but\r\n",
      "as I know you'll do me a good turn another time, and--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stow that gammon,' interposed the robber, impatiently. 'Where is it?\r\n",
      "Hand over!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,' replied the Jew,\r\n",
      "soothingly.  'Here it is!  All safe!'  As he spoke, he drew forth an\r\n",
      "old cotton handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large knot in\r\n",
      "one corner, produced a small brown-paper packet.  Sikes, snatching it\r\n",
      "from him, hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it\r\n",
      "contained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This is all, is it?' inquired Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'All,' replied the Jew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You haven't opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come\r\n",
      "along, have you?' inquired Sikes, suspiciously. 'Don't put on an\r\n",
      "injured look at the question; you've done it many a time. Jerk the\r\n",
      "tinkler.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell.\r\n",
      "It was answered by another Jew:  younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile\r\n",
      "and repulsive in appearance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure.  The Jew, perfectly\r\n",
      "understanding the hint, retired to fill it:  previously exchanging a\r\n",
      "remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if\r\n",
      "in expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the\r\n",
      "action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third\r\n",
      "person.  It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie\r\n",
      "the boot-lace which the dog had torn.  Possibly, if he had observed the\r\n",
      "brief interchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no\r\n",
      "good to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is anybody here, Barney?' inquired Fagin; speaking, now that that\r\n",
      "Sikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Dot a shoul,' replied Barney; whose words:  whether they came from the\r\n",
      "heart or not:  made their way through the nose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nobody?' inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise:  which perhaps might\r\n",
      "mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Dobody but Biss Dadsy,' replied Barney.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nancy!' exclaimed Sikes.  'Where?  Strike me blind, if I don't honour\r\n",
      "that 'ere girl, for her native talents.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She's bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,' replied Barney.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Send her here,' said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor. 'Send her\r\n",
      "here.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Barney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining\r\n",
      "silent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he retired; and\r\n",
      "presently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the\r\n",
      "bonnet, apron, basket, and street-door key, complete.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You are on the scent, are you, Nancy?' inquired Sikes, proffering the\r\n",
      "glass.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, I am, Bill,' replied the young lady, disposing of its contents;\r\n",
      "'and tired enough of it I am, too.  The young brat's been ill and\r\n",
      "confined to the crib; and--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah, Nancy, dear!' said Fagin, looking up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew's red eye-brows, and a\r\n",
      "half closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was\r\n",
      "disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance.\r\n",
      "The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she\r\n",
      "suddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon Mr.\r\n",
      "Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters. In about ten minutes'\r\n",
      "time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy\r\n",
      "pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to go.\r\n",
      "Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself,\r\n",
      "expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together,\r\n",
      "followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard\r\n",
      "as soon as his master was out of sight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it;\r\n",
      "looked after him as he walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched\r\n",
      "fist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated\r\n",
      "himself at the table; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the\r\n",
      "interesting pages of the Hue-and-Cry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he was within so very\r\n",
      "short a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his way to the\r\n",
      "book-stall.  When he got into Clerkenwell, he accidently turned down a\r\n",
      "by-street which was not exactly in his way; but not discovering his\r\n",
      "mistake until he had got half-way down it, and knowing it must lead in\r\n",
      "the right direction, he did not think it worth while to turn back; and\r\n",
      "so marched on, as quickly as he could, with the books under his arm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he ought to\r\n",
      "feel; and how much he would give for only one look at poor little Dick,\r\n",
      "who, starved and beaten, might be weeping bitterly at that very moment;\r\n",
      "when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud.  'Oh, my\r\n",
      "dear brother!'  And he had hardly looked up, to see what the matter\r\n",
      "was, when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round\r\n",
      "his neck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Don't,' cried Oliver, struggling.  'Let go of me.  Who is it? What are\r\n",
      "you stopping me for?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations from\r\n",
      "the young woman who had embraced him; and who had a little basket and a\r\n",
      "street-door key in her hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh my gracious!' said the young woman, 'I have found him!  Oh! Oliver!\r\n",
      "Oliver!  Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer such distress on your\r\n",
      "account!  Come home, dear, come.  Oh, I've found him.  Thank gracious\r\n",
      "goodness heavins, I've found him!'  With these incoherent exclamations,\r\n",
      "the young woman burst into another fit of crying, and got so dreadfully\r\n",
      "hysterical, that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a\r\n",
      "butcher's boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet, who was\r\n",
      "also looking on, whether he didn't think he had better run for the\r\n",
      "doctor.  To which, the butcher's boy:  who appeared of a lounging, not\r\n",
      "to say indolent disposition:  replied, that he thought not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, no, no, never mind,' said the young woman, grasping Oliver's hand;\r\n",
      "'I'm better now.  Come home directly, you cruel boy! Come!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, ma'am,' replied the young woman, 'he ran away, near a month ago,\r\n",
      "from his parents, who are hard-working and respectable people; and went\r\n",
      "and joined a set of thieves and bad characters; and almost broke his\r\n",
      "mother's heart.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Young wretch!' said one woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Go home, do, you little brute,' said the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I am not,' replied Oliver, greatly alarmed.  'I don't know her. I\r\n",
      "haven't any sister, or father and mother either.  I'm an orphan; I live\r\n",
      "at Pentonville.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Only hear him, how he braves it out!' cried the young woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, it's Nancy!' exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for the first\r\n",
      "time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You see he knows me!' cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders. 'He\r\n",
      "can't help himself.  Make him come home, there's good people, or he'll\r\n",
      "kill his dear mother and father, and break my heart!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What the devil's this?' said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop, with\r\n",
      "a white dog at his heels; 'young Oliver! Come home to your poor mother,\r\n",
      "you young dog!  Come home directly.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't belong to them.  I don't know them.  Help! help!' cried\r\n",
      "Oliver, struggling in the man's powerful grasp.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Help!' repeated the man.  'Yes; I'll help you, you young rascal!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What books are these?  You've been a stealing 'em, have you? Give 'em\r\n",
      "here.'  With these words, the man tore the volumes from his grasp, and\r\n",
      "struck him on the head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's right!' cried a looker-on, from a garret-window. 'That's the\r\n",
      "only way of bringing him to his senses!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'To be sure!' cried a sleepy-faced carpenter, casting an approving look\r\n",
      "at the garret-window.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It'll do him good!' said the two women.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And he shall have it, too!' rejoined the man, administering another\r\n",
      "blow, and seizing Oliver by the collar.  'Come on, you young villain!\r\n",
      "Here, Bull's-eye, mind him, boy!  Mind him!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Weak with recent illness; stupified by the blows and the suddenness of\r\n",
      "the attack; terrified by the fierce growling of the dog, and the\r\n",
      "brutality of the man; overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders\r\n",
      "that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be;\r\n",
      "what could one poor child do!  Darkness had set in; it was a low\r\n",
      "neighborhood; no help was near; resistance was useless.  In another\r\n",
      "moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was\r\n",
      "forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to\r\n",
      "give utterance to, unintelligible.  It was of little moment, indeed,\r\n",
      "whether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for\r\n",
      "them, had they been ever so plain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "The gas-lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the\r\n",
      "open door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if\r\n",
      "there were any traces of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat,\r\n",
      "perseveringly, in the dark parlour, with the watch between them.\r\n",

      "RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open\r\n",
      "space; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other\r\n",
      "indications of a cattle-market.  Sikes slackened his pace when they\r\n",
      "reached this spot:  the girl being quite unable to support any longer,\r\n",
      "the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked.  Turning to Oliver,\r\n",
      "he roughly commanded him to take hold of Nancy's hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do you hear?' growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked round.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "The dog looked up, and growled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "'if he speaks ever so soft a word, hold him!  D'ye mind!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dog growled again; and licking his lips, eyed Oliver as if he were\r\n",
      "anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He's as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn't!' said\r\n",

      "Bull's-eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually\r\n",
      "endearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl\r\n",
      "for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been\r\n",
      "Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary. The night\r\n",
      "was dark and foggy.  The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle\r\n",
      "through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the\r\n",
      "streets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger\r\n",

      "depressing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell struck the\r\n",

      "'Of course they can,' replied Sikes.  'It was Bartlemy time when I was\r\n",
      "shopped; and there warn't a penny trumpet in the fair, as I couldn't\r\n",
      "hear the squeaking on.  Arter I was locked up for the night, the row\r\n",
      "and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could\r\n",
      "almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Poor fellow!' said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards the\r\n",
      "quarter in which the bell had sounded.  'Oh, Bill, such fine young\r\n",
      "chaps as them!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes; that's all you women think of,' answered Sikes.  'Fine young\r\n",
      "chaps!  Well, they're as good as dead, so it don't much matter.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency\r\n",
      "to jealousy, and, clasping Oliver's wrist more firmly, told him to step\r\n",
      "out again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Wait a minute!' said the girl:  'I wouldn't hurry by, if it was you\r\n",
      "that was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o'clock struck,\r\n",
      "Bill.  I'd walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the snow\r\n",
      "was on the ground, and I hadn't a shawl to cover me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And what good would that do?' inquired the unsentimental Mr. Sikes.\r\n",
      "'Unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout\r\n",
      "rope, you might as well be walking fifty mile off, or not walking at\r\n",
      "all, for all the good it would do me.  Come on, and don't stand\r\n",
      "preaching there.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl burst into a laugh; drew her shawl more closely round her; and\r\n",
      "they walked away.  But Oliver felt her hand tremble, and, looking up in\r\n",
      "her face as they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly\r\n",
      "white.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full\r\n",
      "half-hour:  meeting very few people, and those appearing from their\r\n",
      "looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself.\r\n",
      "At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full of\r\n",
      "old-clothes shops; the dog running forward, as if conscious that there\r\n",
      "was no further occasion for his keeping on guard, stopped before the\r\n",
      "door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted; the house was\r\n",
      "in a ruinous condition, and on the door was nailed a board, intimating\r\n",
      "that it was to let:  which looked as if it had hung there for many\r\n",
      "years.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'All right,' cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell.\r\n",
      "They crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood for a few\r\n",
      "moments under a lamp.  A noise, as if a sash window were gently raised,\r\n",
      "was heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened.  Mr. Sikes then\r\n",
      "seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony; and\r\n",
      "all three were quickly inside the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The passage was perfectly dark.  They waited, while the person who had\r\n",
      "let them in, chained and barred the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Anybody here?' inquired Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is the old 'un here?' asked the robber.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,' replied the voice, 'and precious down in the mouth he has been.\r\n",
      "Won't he be glad to see you?  Oh, no!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it,\r\n",
      "seemed familiar to Oliver's ears:  but it was impossible to distinguish\r\n",
      "even the form of the speaker in the darkness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Let's have a glim,' said Sikes, 'or we shall go breaking our necks, or\r\n",
      "treading on the dog.  Look after your legs if you do!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stand still a moment, and I'll get you one,' replied the voice. The\r\n",
      "receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute,\r\n",
      "the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared.\r\n",
      "He bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft\r\n",
      "stick.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of\r\n",
      "recognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin; but, turning away,\r\n",
      "beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs. They\r\n",
      "crossed an empty kitchen; and, opening the door of a low\r\n",
      "earthy-smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a small\r\n",
      "back-yard, were received with a shout of laughter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, my wig, my wig!' cried Master Charles Bates, from whose lungs the\r\n",
      "laughter had proceeded:  'here he is! oh, cry, here he is!  Oh, Fagin,\r\n",
      "look at him!  Fagin, do look at him! I can't bear it; it is such a\r\n",
      "jolly game, I cant' bear it.  Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid himself\r\n",
      "flat on the floor: and kicked convulsively for five minutes, in an\r\n",
      "ectasy of facetious joy.  Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the\r\n",
      "cleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him round\r\n",
      "and round; while the Jew, taking off his nightcap, made a great number\r\n",
      "of low bows to the bewildered boy.  The Artful, meantime, who was of a\r\n",
      "rather saturnine disposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it\r\n",
      "interfered with business, rifled Oliver's pockets with steady assiduity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Look at his togs, Fagin!' said Charley, putting the light so close to\r\n",
      "his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire.  'Look at his togs!\r\n",
      "Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut!  Oh, my eye, what a game!\r\n",
      "And his books, too!  Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear,' said the Jew, bowing\r\n",
      "with mock humility.  'The Artful shall give you another suit, my dear,\r\n",
      "for fear you should spoil that Sunday one.  Why didn't you write, my\r\n",
      "dear, and say you were coming?  We'd have got something warm for\r\n",
      "supper.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed,\r\n",
      "and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound\r\n",
      "note at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery\r\n",
      "awakened his merriment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hallo, what's that?' inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew\r\n",
      "seized the note.  'That's mine, Fagin.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no, my dear,' said the Jew.  'Mine, Bill, mine.  You shall have\r\n",
      "the books.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If that ain't mine!' said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat with a\r\n",
      "determined air; 'mine and Nancy's that is; I'll take the boy back\r\n",
      "again.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew started.  Oliver started too, though from a very different\r\n",
      "cause; for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being\r\n",
      "taken back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come!  Hand over, will you?' said Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?' inquired the\r\n",
      "Jew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Fair, or not fair,' retorted Sikes, 'hand over, I tell you! Do you\r\n",
      "think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time\r\n",
      "but to spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping, every young boy as\r\n",
      "gets grabbed through you?  Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton,\r\n",
      "give it here!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between\r\n",
      "the Jew's finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face,\r\n",
      "folded it up small, and tied it in his neckerchief.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's for our share of the trouble,' said Sikes; 'and not half\r\n",
      "enough, neither.  You may keep the books, if you're fond of reading.\r\n",
      "If you ain't, sell 'em.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'They're very pretty,' said Charley Bates: who, with sundry grimaces,\r\n",
      "had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; 'beautiful\r\n",
      "writing, isn't is, Oliver?'  At sight of the dismayed look with which\r\n",
      "Oliver regarded his tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a\r\n",
      "lively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more\r\n",
      "boisterous than the first.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'They belong to the old gentleman,' said Oliver, wringing his hands;\r\n",
      "'to the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had\r\n",
      "me nursed, when I was near dying of the fever. Oh, pray send them back;\r\n",
      "send him back the books and money.  Keep me here all my life long; but\r\n",
      "pray, pray send them back.  He'll think I stole them; the old lady:\r\n",
      "all of them who were so kind to me: will think I stole them.  Oh, do\r\n",
      "have mercy upon me, and send them back!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate\r\n",
      "grief, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew's feet; and beat his hands\r\n",
      "together, in perfect desperation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The boy's right,' remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and knitting\r\n",
      "his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot.  'You're right, Oliver, you're\r\n",
      "right; they WILL think you have stolen 'em.  Ha! ha!' chuckled the Jew,\r\n",
      "rubbing his hands, 'it couldn't have happened better, if we had chosen\r\n",
      "our time!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Of course it couldn't,' replied Sikes; 'I know'd that, directly I see\r\n",
      "him coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his arm.  It's all\r\n",
      "right enough.  They're soft-hearted psalm-singers, or they wouldn't\r\n",
      "have taken him in at all; and they'll ask no questions after him, fear\r\n",
      "they should be obliged to prosecute, and so get him lagged.  He's safe\r\n",
      "enough.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being\r\n",
      "spoken, as if he were bewildered, and could scarecely understand what\r\n",
      "passed; but when Bill Sikes concluded, he jumped suddenly to his feet,\r\n",
      "and tore wildly from the room:  uttering shrieks for help, which made\r\n",
      "the bare old house echo to the roof.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Keep back the dog, Bill!' cried Nancy, springing before the door, and\r\n",
      "closing it, as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit.  'Keep\r\n",
      "back the dog; he'll tear the boy to pieces.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Serve him right!' cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from\r\n",
      "the girl's grasp.  'Stand off from me, or I'll split your head against\r\n",
      "the wall.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't care for that, Bill, I don't care for that,' screamed the\r\n",
      "girl, struggling violently with the man, 'the child shan't be torn down\r\n",
      "by the dog, unless you kill me first.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Shan't he!' said Sikes, setting his teeth.  'I'll soon do that, if you\r\n",
      "don't keep off.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the\r\n",
      "room, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among\r\n",
      "them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's the matter here!' said Fagin, looking round.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The girl's gone mad, I think,' replied Sikes, savagely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, she hasn't,' said Nancy, pale and breathless from the scuffle;\r\n",
      "'no, she hasn't, Fagin; don't think it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then keep quiet, will you?' said the Jew, with a threatening look.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, I won't do that, neither,' replied Nancy, speaking very loud.\r\n",
      "'Come!  What do you think of that?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs\r\n",
      "of that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel\r\n",
      "tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any\r\n",
      "conversation with her, at present.  With the view of diverting the\r\n",
      "attention of the company, he turned to Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?' said the Jew, taking up\r\n",
      "a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace; 'eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver made no reply.  But he watched the Jew's motions, and breathed\r\n",
      "quickly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Wanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?' sneered the\r\n",
      "Jew, catching the boy by the arm.  'We'll cure you of that, my young\r\n",
      "master.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver's shoulders with the club; and\r\n",
      "was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it\r\n",
      "from his hand.  She flung it into the fire, with a force that brought\r\n",
      "some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I won't stand by and see it done, Fagin,' cried the girl. 'You've got\r\n",
      "the boy, and what more would you have?--Let him be--let him be--or I\r\n",
      "shall put that mark on some of you, that will bring me to the gallows\r\n",
      "before my time.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this\r\n",
      "threat; and with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched, looked\r\n",
      "alternately at the Jew and the other robber: her face quite colourless\r\n",
      "from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, Nancy!' said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause, during\r\n",
      "which he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted\r\n",
      "manner; 'you,--you're more clever than ever to-night.  Ha! ha! my dear,\r\n",
      "you are acting beautifully.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Am I!' said the girl.  'Take care I don't overdo it.  You will be the\r\n",
      "worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep\r\n",
      "clear of me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is something about a roused woman: especially if she add to all\r\n",
      "her other strong passions, the fierce impulses of recklessness and\r\n",
      "despair; which few men like to provoke. The Jew saw that it would be\r\n",
      "hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss\r\n",
      "Nancy's rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a\r\n",
      "glance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that\r\n",
      "he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal\r\n",
      "pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy\r\n",
      "to reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and\r\n",
      "threats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the\r\n",
      "fertility of his invention. As they produced no visible effect on the\r\n",
      "object against whom they were discharged, however, he resorted to more\r\n",
      "tangible arguments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What do you mean by this?' said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very\r\n",
      "common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features:\r\n",
      "which, if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand\r\n",
      "times that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a\r\n",
      "disorder as measles: 'what do you mean by it?  Burn my body!  Do you\r\n",
      "know who you are, and what you are?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, yes, I know all about it,' replied the girl, laughing\r\n",
      "hysterically; and shaking her head from side to side, with a poor\r\n",
      "assumption of indifference.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, then, keep quiet,' rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he was\r\n",
      "accustomed to use when addressing his dog, 'or I'll quiet you for a\r\n",
      "good long time to come.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl laughed again: even less composedly than before; and, darting\r\n",
      "a hasty look at Sikes, turned her face aside, and bit her lip till the\r\n",
      "blood came.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You're a nice one,' added Sikes, as he surveyed her with a\r\n",
      "contemptuous air, 'to take up the humane and gen--teel side!  A pretty\r\n",
      "subject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend of!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'God Almighty help me, I am!' cried the girl passionately; 'and I wish\r\n",
      "I had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places with them\r\n",
      "we passed so near to-night, before I had lent a hand in bringing him\r\n",
      "here.  He's a thief, a liar, a devil, all that's bad, from this night\r\n",
      "forth.  Isn't that enough for the old wretch, without blows?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come, come, Sikes,' said the Jew appealing to him in a remonstratory\r\n",
      "tone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive to all\r\n",
      "that passed; 'we must have civil words; civil words, Bill.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Civil words!' cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to see.\r\n",
      "'Civil words, you villain!  Yes, you deserve 'em from me. I thieved for\r\n",
      "you when I was a child not half as old as this!' pointing to Oliver.\r\n",
      "'I have been in the same trade, and in the same service, for twelve\r\n",
      "years since.  Don't you know it?  Speak out!  Don't you know it?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, well,' replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; 'and,\r\n",
      "if you have, it's your living!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Aye, it is!' returned the girl; not speaking, but pouring out the\r\n",
      "words in one continuous and vehement scream.  'It is my living; and the\r\n",
      "cold, wet, dirty streets are my home; and you're the wretch that drove\r\n",
      "me to them long ago, and that'll keep me there, day and night, day and\r\n",
      "night, till I die!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I shall do you a mischief!' interposed the Jew, goaded by these\r\n",
      "reproaches; 'a mischief worse than that, if you say much more!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl said nothing more; but, tearing her hair and dress in a\r\n",
      "transport of passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably\r\n",
      "have left signal marks of her revenge upon him, had not her wrists been\r\n",
      "seized by Sikes at the right moment; upon which, she made a few\r\n",
      "ineffectual struggles, and fainted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She's all right now,' said Sikes, laying her down in a corner. 'She's\r\n",
      "uncommon strong in the arms, when she's up in this way.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew wiped his forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have\r\n",
      "the disturbance over; but neither he, nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the\r\n",
      "boys, seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance\r\n",

      "all public characters, as I may say, must suffer prosecution.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Mann, not very well knowing what the beadle meant, raised her\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'To London, ma'am,' resumed the inflexible beadle, 'by coach.  I and\r\n",
      "two paupers, Mrs. Mann!  A legal action is a coming on, about a\r\n",
      "settlement; and the board has appointed me--me, Mrs. Mann--to dispose\r\n",
      "to the matter before the quarter-sessions at Clerkinwell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And I very much question,' added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up,\r\n",

      "box before they have done with me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "only themselves to thank.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing\r\n",
      "manner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words, that Mrs.\r\n",
      "Mann appeared quite awed by them. At length she said,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You're going by coach, sir?  I thought it was always usual to send\r\n",
      "them paupers in carts.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's when they're ill, Mrs. Mann,' said the beadle.  'We put the\r\n",
      "sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather, to prevent their\r\n",
      "taking cold.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "would come two pound cheaper to move 'em than to bury 'em--that is, if\r\n",
      "we can throw 'em upon another parish, which I think we shall be able to\r\n",
      "do, if they don't die upon the road to spite us.  Ha! ha! ha!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again encountered\r\n",
      "the cocked hat; and he became grave.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We are forgetting business, ma'am,' said the beadle; 'here is your\r\n",
      "porochial stipend for the month.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his\r\n",
      "pocket-book; and requested a receipt:  which Mrs. Mann wrote.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's very much blotted, sir,' said the farmer of infants; 'but it's\r\n",
      "formal enough, I dare say.  Thank you, Mr. Bumble, sir, I am very much\r\n",
      "obliged to you, I'm sure.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble nodded, blandly, in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann's curtsey;\r\n",
      "and inquired how the children were.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bless their dear little hearts!' said Mrs. Mann with emotion, 'they're\r\n",
      "as well as can be, the dears!  Of course, except the two that died last\r\n",
      "week.  And little Dick.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Isn't that boy no better?' inquired Mr. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Mann shook her head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He's a ill-conditioned, wicious, bad-disposed porochial child that,'\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'I'll bring him to you in one minute, sir,' replied Mrs. Mann. 'Here,\r\n",
      "you Dick!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After some calling, Dick was discovered.  Having had his face put under\r\n",
      "the pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann's gown, he was led into the awful\r\n",
      "presence of Mr. Bumble, the beadle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The child was pale and thin; his cheeks were sunken; and his eyes large\r\n",
      "and bright.  The scanty parish dress, the livery of his misery, hung\r\n",
      "loosely on his feeble body; and his young limbs had wasted away, like\r\n",
      "those of an old man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble's\r\n",
      "glance; not daring to lift his eyes from the floor; and dreading even\r\n",
      "to hear the beadle's voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Can't you look at the gentleman, you obstinate boy?' said Mrs. Mann.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's the matter with you, porochial Dick?' inquired Mr. Bumble, with\r\n",
      "well-timed jocularity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing, sir,' replied the child faintly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I should think not,' said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed very\r\n",
      "much at Mr. Bumble's humour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You want for nothing, I'm sure.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I should like--' faltered the child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hey-day!' interposed Mr. Mann, 'I suppose you're going to say that you\r\n",
      "DO want for something, now?  Why, you little wretch--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stop, Mrs. Mann, stop!' said the beadle, raising his hand with a show\r\n",
      "of authority.  'Like what, sir, eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I should like,' faltered the child, 'if somebody that can write, would\r\n",
      "put a few words down for me on a piece of paper, and fold it up and\r\n",
      "seal it, and keep it for me, after I am laid in the ground.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, what does the boy mean?' exclaimed Mr. Bumble, on whom the\r\n",
      "earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression:\r\n",
      "accustomed as he was to such things.  'What do you mean, sir?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I should like,' said the child, 'to leave my dear love to poor Oliver\r\n",
      "Twist; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried to\r\n",
      "think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help\r\n",
      "him.  And I should like to tell him,' said the child pressing his small\r\n",
      "hands together, and speaking with great fervour, 'that I was glad to\r\n",
      "die when I was very young; for, perhaps, if I had lived to be a man,\r\n",
      "and had grown old, my little sister who is in Heaven, might forget me,\r\n",
      "or be unlike me; and it would be so much happier if we were both\r\n",
      "children there together.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with\r\n",
      "indescribable astonishment; and, turning to his companion, said,\r\n",
      "'They're all in one story, Mrs. Mann.  That out-dacious Oliver had\r\n",
      "demogalized them all!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I couldn't have believed it, sir' said Mrs Mann, holding up her hands,\r\n",
      "and looking malignantly at Dick.  'I never see such a hardened little\r\n",
      "wretch!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Take him away, ma'am!' said Mr. Bumble imperiously.  'This must be\r\n",
      "stated to the board, Mrs. Mann.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I hope the gentleman will understand that it isn't my fault, sir?'\r\n",
      "said Mrs. Mann, whimpering pathetically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'They shall understand that, ma'am; they shall be acquainted with the\r\n",
      "true state of the case,' said Mr. Bumble.  'There; take him away, I\r\n",
      "can't bear the sight on him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dick was immediately taken away, and locked up in the coal-cellar.  Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble shortly afterwards took himself off, to prepare for his journey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At six o'clock next morning, Mr. Bumble:  having exchanged his cocked\r\n",
      "hat for a round one, and encased his person in a blue great-coat with a\r\n",
      "cape to it:  took his place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by\r\n",
      "the criminals whose settlement was disputed; with whom, in due course\r\n",
      "of time, he arrived in London.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which originated\r\n",
      "in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who persisted in\r\n",
      "shivering, and complaining of the cold, in a manner which, Mr. Bumble\r\n",
      "declared, caused his teeth to chatter in his head, and made him feel\r\n",
      "quite uncomfortable; although he had a great-coat on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night, Mr. Bumble\r\n",
      "sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a\r\n",
      "temperate dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter. Putting a glass\r\n",
      "of hot gin-and-water on the chimney-piece, he drew his chair to the\r\n",
      "fire; and, with sundry moral reflections on the too-prevalent sin of\r\n",
      "discontent and complaining, composed himself to read the paper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble's eye rested, was the\r\n",

      "'And you ARE a beadle, are you not?' inquired Mr. Grimwig.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,' rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Of course,' observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend, 'I knew he was.\r\n",
      "A beadle all over!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend, and\r\n",
      "resumed:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do you know where this poor boy is now?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No more than nobody,' replied Mr. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, what DO you know of him?' inquired the old gentleman. 'Speak\r\n",
      "out, my friend, if you have anything to say.  What DO you know of him?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You don't happen to know any good of him, do you?' said Mr. Grimwig,\r\n",
      "caustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble's features.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head with\r\n",
      "portentous solemnity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You see?' said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble's pursed-up\r\n",
      "countenance; and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding\r\n",
      "Oliver, in as few words as possible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble put down his hat; unbuttoned his coat; folded his arms;\r\n",
      "inclined his head in a retrospective manner; and, after a few moments'\r\n",
      "reflection, commenced his story.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It would be tedious if given in the beadle's words:  occupying, as it\r\n",
      "did, some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance of\r\n",
      "it was, that Oliver was a foundling, born of low and vicious parents.\r\n",
      "That he had, from his birth, displayed no better qualities than\r\n",
      "treachery, ingratitude, and malice.  That he had terminated his brief\r\n",
      "career in the place of his birth, by making a sanguinary and cowardly\r\n",
      "attack on an unoffending lad, and running away in the night-time from\r\n",
      "his master's house.  In proof of his really being the person he\r\n",
      "represented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had\r\n",
      "brought to town. Folding his arms again, he then awaited Mr. Brownlow's\r\n",
      "observations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I fear it is all too true,' said the old gentleman sorrowfully, after\r\n",
      "looking over the papers.  'This is not much for your intelligence; but\r\n",
      "I would gladly have given you treble the money, if it had been\r\n",
      "favourable to the boy.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this\r\n",
      "information at an earlier period of the interview, he might have\r\n",
      "imparted a very different colouring to his little history. It was too\r\n",
      "late to do it now, however; so he shook his head gravely, and,\r\n",
      "pocketing the five guineas, withdrew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so\r\n",
      "much disturbed by the beadle's tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to\r\n",
      "vex him further.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length he stopped, and rang the bell violently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mrs. Bedwin,' said Mr. Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared; 'that\r\n",
      "boy, Oliver, is an imposter.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It can't be, sir.  It cannot be,' said the old lady energetically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I tell you he is,' retorted the old gentleman.  'What do you mean by\r\n",
      "can't be?  We have just heard a full account of him from his birth; and\r\n",
      "he has been a thorough-paced little villain, all his life.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I never will believe it, sir,' replied the old lady, firmly. 'Never!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You old women never believe anything but quack-doctors, and lying\r\n",
      "story-books,' growled Mr. Grimwig.  'I knew it all along. Why didn't\r\n",
      "you take my advise in the beginning; you would if he hadn't had a\r\n",
      "fever, I suppose, eh?  He was interesting, wasn't he?  Interesting!\r\n",
      "Bah!'  And Mr. Grimwig poked the fire with a flourish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir,' retorted Mrs. Bedwin,\r\n",
      "indignantly.  'I know what children are, sir; and have done these forty\r\n",
      "years; and people who can't say the same, shouldn't say anything about\r\n",
      "them.  That's my opinion!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig, who was a bachelor.  As it extorted\r\n",
      "nothing from that gentleman but a smile, the old lady tossed her head,\r\n",
      "and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech, when she was\r\n",
      "stopped by Mr. Brownlow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Silence!' said the old gentleman, feigning an anger he was far from\r\n",
      "feeling.  'Never let me hear the boy's name again.  I rang to tell you\r\n",
      "that.  Never.  Never, on any pretence, mind!  You may leave the room,\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bedwin.  Remember!  I am in earnest.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow's that night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver's heart sank within him, when he thought of his good friends; it\r\n",
      "was well for him that he could not know what they had heard, or it\r\n",
      "might have broken outright.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE\r\n",
      "FRIENDS\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to\r\n",
      "pursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of\r\n",
      "reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of\r\n",
      "which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty, to no ordinary\r\n",
      "extent, in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious\r\n",
      "friends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so\r\n",
      "much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery. Mr. Fagin\r\n",
      "laid great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in, and\r\n",
      "cherished him, when, without his timely aid, he might have perished\r\n",
      "with hunger; and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young\r\n",
      "lad whom, in his philanthropy, he had succoured under parallel\r\n",
      "circumstances, but who, proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing\r\n",
      "a desire to communicate with the police, had unfortunately come to be\r\n",
      "hanged at the Old Bailey one morning.  Mr. Fagin did not seek to\r\n",
      "conceal his share in the catastrophe, but lamented with tears in his\r\n",
      "eyes that the wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the young\r\n",
      "person in question, had rendered it necessary that he should become the\r\n",
      "victim of certain evidence for the crown: which, if it were not\r\n",
      "precisely true, was indispensably necessary for the safety of him (Mr.\r\n",
      "Fagin) and a few select friends.  Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a\r\n",
      "rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging; and, with\r\n",
      "great friendliness and politeness of manner, expressed his anxious\r\n",
      "hopes that he might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that\r\n",
      "unpleasant operation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Little Oliver's blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew's words, and\r\n",
      "imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them.  That it\r\n",
      "was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the\r\n",
      "guilty when they were in accidental companionship, he knew already; and\r\n",
      "that deeply-laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or\r\n",
      "over-communicative persons, had been really devised and carried out by\r\n",
      "the Jew on more occasions than one, he thought by no means unlikely,\r\n",
      "when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that\r\n",
      "gentleman and Mr. Sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some\r\n",
      "foregone conspiracy of the kind.  As he glanced timidly up, and met the\r\n",
      "Jew's searching look, he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs\r\n",
      "were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said, that\r\n",
      "if he kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business, he saw they\r\n",
      "would be very good friends yet.  Then, taking his hat, and covering\r\n",
      "himself with an old patched great-coat, he went out, and locked the\r\n",
      "room-door behind him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part of many\r\n",
      "subsequent days, seeing nobody, between early morning and midnight, and\r\n",
      "left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts.  Which,\r\n",
      "never failing to revert to his kind friends, and the opinion they must\r\n",
      "long ago have formed of him, were sad indeed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the room-door unlocked;\r\n",
      "and he was at liberty to wander about the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a very dirty place.  The rooms upstairs had great high wooden\r\n",
      "chimney-pieces and large doors, with panelled walls and cornices to the\r\n",
      "ceiling; which, although they were black with neglect and dust, were\r\n",
      "ornamented in various ways.  From all of these tokens Oliver concluded\r\n",
      "that a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to\r\n",
      "better people, and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome:  dismal and\r\n",
      "dreary as it looked now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings;\r\n",
      "and sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the mice would\r\n",
      "scamper across the floor, and run back terrified to their holes.  With\r\n",
      "these exceptions, there was neither sight nor sound of any living\r\n",
      "thing; and often, when it grew dark, and he was tired of wandering from\r\n",
      "room to room, he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the\r\n",
      "street-door, to be as near living people as he could; and would remain\r\n",
      "there, listening and counting the hours, until the Jew or the boys\r\n",
      "returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In all the rooms, the mouldering shutters were fast closed:  the bars\r\n",
      "which held them were screwed tight into the wood; the only light which\r\n",
      "was admitted, stealing its way through round holes at the top: which\r\n",
      "made the rooms more gloomy, and filled them with strange shadows.\r\n",
      "There was a back-garret window with rusty bars outside, which had no\r\n",
      "shutter; and out of this, Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for\r\n",
      "hours together; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused\r\n",
      "and crowded mass of housetops, blackened chimneys, and gable-ends.\r\n",
      "Sometimes, indeed, a grizzly head might be seen, peering over the\r\n",
      "parapet-wall of a distant house; but it was quickly withdrawn again;\r\n",
      "and as the window of Oliver's observatory was nailed down, and dimmed\r\n",
      "with the rain and smoke of years, it was as much as he could do to make\r\n",
      "out the forms of the different objects beyond, without making any\r\n",
      "attempt to be seen or heard,--which he had as much chance of being, as\r\n",
      "if he had lived inside the ball of St. Paul's Cathedral.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that\r\n",
      "evening, the first-named young gentleman took it into his head to\r\n",
      "evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person (to do him\r\n",
      "justice, this was by no means an habitual weakness with him); and, with\r\n",
      "this end and aim, he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him in\r\n",
      "his toilet, straightway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some\r\n",
      "faces, however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those\r\n",
      "about him when he could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the\r\n",
      "way of this proposal.  So he at once expressed his readiness; and,\r\n",
      "kneeling on the floor, while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he\r\n",
      "could take his foot in his laps, he applied himself to a process which\r\n",
      "Mr. Dawkins designated as 'japanning his trotter-cases.'  The phrase,\r\n",
      "rendered into plain English, signifieth, cleaning his boots.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational\r\n",
      "animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy\r\n",
      "attitude smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly to and fro, and\r\n",
      "having his boots cleaned all the time, without even the past trouble of\r\n",
      "having taken them off, or the prospective misery of putting them on, to\r\n",
      "disturb his reflections; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco\r\n",
      "that soothed the feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer\r\n",
      "that mollified his thoughts; he was evidently tinctured, for the nonce,\r\n",
      "with a spice of romance and enthusiasm, foreign to his general nature.\r\n",
      "He looked down on Oliver, with a thoughtful countenance, for a brief\r\n",
      "space; and then, raising his head, and heaving a gentle sign, said,\r\n",
      "half in abstraction, and half to Master Bates:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What a pity it is he isn't a prig!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah!' said Master Charles Bates; 'he don't know what's good for him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Dodger sighed again, and resumed his pipe: as did Charley Bates.\r\n",
      "They both smoked, for some seconds, in silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I suppose you don't even know what a prig is?' said the Dodger\r\n",
      "mournfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I think I know that,' replied Oliver, looking up.  'It's a the--;\r\n",
      "you're one, are you not?' inquired Oliver, checking himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I am,' replied the Dodger.  'I'd scorn to be anything else.'  Mr.\r\n",
      "Dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock, after delivering this sentiment,\r\n",
      "and looked at Master Bates, as if to denote that he would feel obliged\r\n",
      "by his saying anything to the contrary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I am,' repeated the Dodger.  'So's Charley.  So's Fagin. So's Sikes.\r\n",
      "So's Nancy.  So's Bet.  So we all are, down to the dog. And he's the\r\n",
      "downiest one of the lot!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And the least given to peaching,' added Charley Bates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He wouldn't so much as bark in a witness-box, for fear of committing\r\n",
      "himself; no, not if you tied him up in one, and left him there without\r\n",
      "wittles for a fortnight,' said the Dodger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not a bit of it,' observed Charley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He's a rum dog.  Don't he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs\r\n",
      "or sings when he's in company!' pursued the Dodger. 'Won't he growl at\r\n",
      "all, when he hears a fiddle playing!  And don't he hate other dogs as\r\n",
      "ain't of his breed!  Oh, no!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He's an out-and-out Christian,' said Charley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal's abilities, but it\r\n",
      "was an appropriate remark in another sense, if Master Bates had only\r\n",
      "known it; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen, claiming to\r\n",
      "be out-and-out Christians, between whom, and Mr. Sikes' dog, there\r\n",
      "exist strong and singular points of resemblance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, well,' said the Dodger, recurring to the point from which they\r\n",
      "had strayed: with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced\r\n",
      "all his proceedings.  'This hasn't go anything to do with young Green\r\n",
      "here.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No more it has,' said Charley.  'Why don't you put yourself under\r\n",
      "Fagin, Oliver?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And make your fortun' out of hand?' added the Dodger, with a grin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And so be able to retire on your property, and do the gen-teel: as I\r\n",
      "mean to, in the very next leap-year but four that ever comes, and the\r\n",
      "forty-second Tuesday in Trinity-week,' said Charley Bates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't like it,' rejoined Oliver, timidly; 'I wish they would let me\r\n",
      "go.  I--I--would rather go.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And Fagin would RATHER not!' rejoined Charley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to\r\n",
      "express his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with his\r\n",
      "boot-cleaning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Go!' exclaimed the Dodger.  'Why, where's your spirit?' Don't you take\r\n",
      "any pride out of yourself?  Would you go and be dependent on your\r\n",
      "friends?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, blow that!' said Master Bates: drawing two or three silk\r\n",
      "handkerchiefs from his pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard,\r\n",
      "'that's too mean; that is.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'_I_ couldn't do it,' said the Dodger, with an air of haughty disgust.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You can leave your friends, though,' said Oliver with a half smile;\r\n",
      "'and let them be punished for what you did.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That,' rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his pipe, 'That was all out\r\n",
      "of consideration for Fagin, 'cause the traps know that we work\r\n",
      "together, and he might have got into trouble if we hadn't made our\r\n",
      "lucky; that was the move, wasn't it, Charley?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Master Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but the recollection\r\n",
      "of Oliver's flight came so suddenly upon him, that the smoke he was\r\n",
      "inhaling got entangled with a laugh, and went up into his head, and\r\n",
      "down into his throat: and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping,\r\n",
      "about five minutes long.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Look here!' said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of shillings and\r\n",
      "halfpence. 'Here's a jolly life!  What's the odds where it comes from?\r\n",
      "Here, catch hold; there's plenty more where they were took from.  You\r\n",
      "won't, won't you?  Oh, you precious flat!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's naughty, ain't it, Oliver?' inquired Charley Bates. 'He'll come\r\n",
      "to be scragged, won't he?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't know what that means,' replied Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Something in this way, old feller,' said Charly.  As he said it,\r\n",
      "Master Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief; and, holding it erect\r\n",
      "in the air, dropped his head on his shoulder, and jerked a curious\r\n",
      "sound through his teeth; thereby indicating, by a lively pantomimic\r\n",
      "representation, that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's what it means,' said Charley.  'Look how he stares, Jack!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I never did see such prime company as that 'ere boy; he'll be the death\r\n",
      "of me, I know he will.'  Master Charley Bates, having laughed heartily\r\n",
      "again, resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You've been brought up bad,' said the Dodger, surveying his boots with\r\n",
      "much satisfaction when Oliver had polished them. 'Fagin will make\r\n",
      "something of you, though, or you'll be the first he ever had that\r\n",
      "turned out unprofitable.  You'd better begin at once; for you'll come\r\n",
      "to the trade long before you think of it; and you're only losing time,\r\n",
      "Oliver.'\r\n",

      "deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that\r\n",

      "and professional aquirements.  He had small twinkling eyes, and a\r\n",
      "pock-marked face; wore a fur cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy\r\n",
      "fustian trousers, and an apron.  His wardrobe was, in truth, rather out\r\n",
      "of repair; but he excused himself to the company by stating that his\r\n",
      "'time' was only out an hour before; and that, in consequence of having\r\n",
      "worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he had not been able to bestow\r\n",
      "any attention on his private clothes.  Mr. Chitling added, with strong\r\n",
      "marks of irritation, that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder\r\n",
      "was infernal unconstitutional, for it burnt holes in them, and there\r\n",
      "was no remedy against the County.  The same remark he considered to\r\n",
      "apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair: which he held to be\r\n",
      "decidedly unlawful.  Mr. Chitling wound up his observations by stating\r\n",
      "that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty-two moral long\r\n",

      "their chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and\r\n",
      "sit by him, led the conversation to the topics most calculated to\r\n",
      "interest his hearers.  These were, the great advantages of the trade,\r\n",
      "the proficiency of the Dodger, the amiability of Charley Bates, and the\r\n",
      "liberality of the Jew himself.  At length these subjects displayed\r\n",
      "signs of being thoroughly exhausted; and Mr. Chitling did the same:\r\n",

      "IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his\r\n",
      "great-coat tight round his shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up\r\n",
      "over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face:\r\n",
      "emerged from his den.  He paused on the step as the door was locked and\r\n",
      "chained behind him; and having listened while the boys made all secure,\r\n",
      "and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down\r\n",
      "the street as quickly as he could.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighborhood of\r\n",
      "Whitechapel.  The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the\r\n",
      "street; and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck\r\n",
      "off in the direction of the Spitalfields.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the\r\n",
      "streets; the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and\r\n",
      "clammy to the touch.  It seemed just the night when it befitted such a\r\n",
      "being as the Jew to be abroad.  As he glided stealthily along, creeping\r\n",
      "beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man\r\n",
      "seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and\r\n",
      "darkness through which he moved: crawling forth, by night, in search of\r\n",
      "some rich offal for a meal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He kept on his course, through many winding and narrow ways, until he\r\n",
      "reached Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly off to the left, he soon\r\n",
      "became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in\r\n",
      "that close and densely-populated quarter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be\r\n",
      "at all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the\r\n",
      "intricacies of the way.  He hurried through several alleys and streets,\r\n",
      "and at length turned into one, lighted only by a single lamp at the\r\n",
      "farther end.  At the door of a house in this street, he knocked; having\r\n",
      "exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it, he walked\r\n",
      "upstairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door; and a man's\r\n",
      "voice demanded who was there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Only me, Bill; only me, my dear,' said the Jew looking in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bring in your body then,' said Sikes.  'Lie down, you stupid brute!\r\n",
      "Don't you know the devil when he's got a great-coat on?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Apparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin's outer\r\n",
      "garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a\r\n",
      "chair, he retired to the corner from which he had risen:  wagging his\r\n",
      "tail as he went, to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his\r\n",
      "nature to be.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well!' said Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, my dear,' replied the Jew.--'Ah! Nancy.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to\r\n",
      "imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had\r\n",
      "not met, since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver.  All doubts upon\r\n",
      "the subject, if he had any, were speedily removed by the young lady's\r\n",
      "behaviour.  She took her feet off the fender, pushed back her chair,\r\n",
      "and bade Fagin draw up his, without saying more about it:  for it was a\r\n",
      "cold night, and no mistake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It is cold, Nancy dear,' said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny hands\r\n",
      "over the fire.  'It seems to go right through one,' added the old man,\r\n",
      "touching his side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,' said\r\n",

      "haste!  It's enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase\r\n",
      "shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were\r\n",
      "many:  which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were\r\n",
      "filled with several kinds of liquids.  Sikes pouring out a glass of\r\n",
      "brandy, bade the Jew drink it off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Quite enough, quite, thankye, Bill,' replied the Jew, putting down the\r\n",
      "glass after just setting his lips to it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What!  You're afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?'\r\n",
      "inquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew.  'Ugh!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr. Sikes seized the glass, and threw\r\n",
      "the remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony\r\n",
      "to filling it again for himself:  which he did at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew glanced round the room, as his companion tossed down the second\r\n",
      "glassful; not in curiousity, for he had seen it often before; but in a\r\n",
      "restless and suspicious manner habitual to him. It was a meanly\r\n",
      "furnished apartment, with nothing but the contents of the closet to\r\n",
      "induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man; and\r\n",
      "with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three\r\n",
      "heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner, and a 'life-preserver' that\r\n",
      "hung over the chimney-piece.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There,' said Sikes, smacking his lips. 'Now I'm ready.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'For business?' inquired the Jew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'For business,' replied Sikes; 'so say what you've got to say.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'About the crib at Chertsey, Bill?' said the Jew, drawing his chair\r\n",
      "forward, and speaking in a very low voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes.  Wot about it?' inquired Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah! you know what I mean, my dear,' said the Jew.  'He knows what I\r\n",
      "mean, Nancy; don't he?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, he don't,' sneered Mr. Sikes.  'Or he won't, and that's the same\r\n",
      "thing.  Speak out, and call things by their right names; don't sit\r\n",
      "there, winking and blinking, and talking to me in hints, as if you\r\n",
      "warn't the very first that thought about the robbery.  Wot d'ye mean?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hush, Bill, hush!' said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop\r\n",
      "this burst of indignation; 'somebody will hear us, my dear. Somebody\r\n",
      "will hear us.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Let 'em hear!' said Sikes; 'I don't care.'  But as Mr. Sikes DID care,\r\n",
      "on reflection, he dropped his voice as he said the words, and grew\r\n",
      "calmer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There, there,' said the Jew, coaxingly.  'It was only my caution,\r\n",
      "nothing more.  Now, my dear, about that crib at Chertsey; when is it to\r\n",
      "be done, Bill, eh?  When is it to be done?  Such plate, my dear, such\r\n",
      "plate!' said the Jew:  rubbing his hands, and elevating his eyebrows in\r\n",
      "a rapture of anticipation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not at all,' replied Sikes coldly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not to be done at all!' echoed the Jew, leaning back in his chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, not at all,' rejoined Sikes.  'At least it can't be a put-up job,\r\n",
      "as we expected.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then it hasn't been properly gone about,' said the Jew, turning pale\r\n",
      "with anger.  'Don't tell me!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'But I will tell you,' retorted Sikes.  'Who are you that's not to be\r\n",
      "told?  I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging about the place\r\n",
      "for a fortnight, and he can't get one of the servants in line.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do you mean to tell me, Bill,' said the Jew: softening as the other\r\n",
      "grew heated:  'that neither of the two men in the house can be got\r\n",
      "over?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, I do mean to tell you so,' replied Sikes.  'The old lady has had\r\n",
      "'em these twenty years; and if you were to give 'em five hundred pound,\r\n",
      "they wouldn't be in it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'But do you mean to say, my dear,' remonstrated the Jew, 'that the\r\n",
      "women can't be got over?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not a bit of it,' replied Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not by flash Toby Crackit?' said the Jew incredulously. 'Think what\r\n",
      "women are, Bill,'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No; not even by flash Toby Crackit,' replied Sikes.  'He says he's\r\n",
      "worn sham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole blessed time he's\r\n",
      "been loitering down there, and it's all of no use.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers, my\r\n",
      "dear,' said the Jew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So he did,' rejoined Sikes, 'and they warn't of no more use than the\r\n",
      "other plant.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew looked blank at this information.  After ruminating for some\r\n",
      "minutes with his chin sunk on his breast, he raised his head and said,\r\n",
      "with a deep sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright, he feared\r\n",
      "the game was up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And yet,' said the old man, dropping his hands on his knees, 'it's a\r\n",
      "sad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So it is,' said Mr. Sikes.  'Worse luck!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep\r\n",
      "thought, with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy\r\n",
      "perfectly demoniacal.  Sikes eyed him furtively from time to time.\r\n",
      "Nancy, apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker, sat with her\r\n",
      "eyes fixed upon the fire, as if she had been deaf to all that passed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Fagin,' said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed;\r\n",
      "'is it worth fifty shiners extra, if it's safely done from the outside?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,' said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is it a bargain?' inquired Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, my dear, yes,' rejoined the Jew; his eyes glistening, and every\r\n",
      "muscle in his face working, with the excitement that the inquiry had\r\n",
      "awakened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then,' said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew's hand, with some disdain,\r\n",
      "'let it come off as soon as you like.  Toby and me were over the\r\n",
      "garden-wall the night afore last, sounding the panels of the door and\r\n",
      "shutters.  The crib's barred up at night like a jail; but there's one\r\n",
      "part we can crack, safe and softly.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Which is that, Bill?' asked the Jew eagerly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why,' whispered Sikes, 'as you cross the lawn--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes?' said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his eyes almost\r\n",
      "starting out of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Umph!' cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving her\r\n",
      "head, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew's\r\n",
      "face.  'Never mind which part it is. You can't do it without me, I\r\n",
      "know; but it's best to be on the safe side when one deals with you.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'As you like, my dear, as you like' replied the Jew.  'Is there no help\r\n",
      "wanted, but yours and Toby's?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'None,' said Sikes.  'Cept a centre-bit and a boy.  The first we've\r\n",
      "both got; the second you must find us.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A boy!' exclaimed the Jew.  'Oh! then it's a panel, eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Never mind wot it is!' replied Sikes.  'I want a boy, and he musn't be\r\n",
      "a big 'un.  Lord!' said Mr. Sikes, reflectively, 'if I'd only got that\r\n",
      "young boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper's!  He kept him small on\r\n",
      "purpose, and let him out by the job.  But the father gets lagged; and\r\n",
      "then the Juvenile Delinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away from\r\n",
      "a trade where he was earning money, teaches him to read and write, and\r\n",
      "in time makes a 'prentice of him.  And so they go on,' said Mr. Sikes,\r\n",
      "his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs, 'so they go on;\r\n",
      "and, if they'd got money enough (which it's a Providence they haven't,)\r\n",
      "we shouldn't have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year\r\n",
      "or two.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No more we should,' acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering\r\n",
      "during this speech, and had only caught the last sentence. 'Bill!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What now?' inquired Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the\r\n",
      "fire; and intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told to leave\r\n",
      "the room.  Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as if he thought\r\n",
      "the precaution unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting\r\n",
      "Miss Nancy to fetch him a jug of beer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You don't want any beer,' said Nancy, folding her arms, and retaining\r\n",
      "her seat very composedly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I tell you I do!' replied Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nonsense,' rejoined the girl coolly, 'Go on, Fagin.  I know what he's\r\n",
      "going to say, Bill; he needn't mind me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew still hesitated.  Sikes looked from one to the other in some\r\n",
      "surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, you don't mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?' he asked at length.\r\n",
      "'You've known her long enough to trust her, or the Devil's in it.  She\r\n",
      "ain't one to blab.  Are you Nancy?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'_I_ should think not!' replied the young lady:  drawing her chair up\r\n",
      "to the table, and putting her elbows upon it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no, my dear, I know you're not,' said the Jew; 'but--' and again\r\n",
      "the old man paused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'But wot?' inquired Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I didn't know whether she mightn't p'r'aps be out of sorts, you know,\r\n",
      "my dear, as she was the other night,' replied the Jew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, swallowing\r\n",
      "a glass of brandy, shook her head with an air of defiance, and burst\r\n",
      "into sundry exclamations of 'Keep the game a-going!'  'Never say die!'\r\n",
      "and the like.  These seemed to have the effect of re-assuring both\r\n",
      "gentlemen; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air, and\r\n",
      "resumed his seat: as did Mr. Sikes likewise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now, Fagin,' said Nancy with a laugh.  'Tell Bill at once, about\r\n",
      "Oliver!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ha! you're a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!' said\r\n",
      "the Jew, patting her on the neck.  'It WAS about Oliver I was going to\r\n",
      "speak, sure enough.  Ha! ha! ha!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What about him?' demanded Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He's the boy for you, my dear,' replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper;\r\n",
      "laying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning frightfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He!' exclaimed Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Have him, Bill!' said Nancy.  'I would, if I was in your place. He\r\n",
      "mayn't be so much up, as any of the others; but that's not what you\r\n",
      "want, if he's only to open a door for you.  Depend upon it he's a safe\r\n",
      "one, Bill.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I know he is,' rejoined Fagin.  'He's been in good training these last\r\n",
      "few weeks, and it's time he began to work for his bread.  Besides, the\r\n",
      "others are all too big.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, he is just the size I want,' said Mr. Sikes, ruminating.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And will do everything you want, Bill, my dear,' interposed the Jew;\r\n",
      "'he can't help himself.  That is, if you frighten him enough.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Frighten him!' echoed Sikes.  'It'll be no sham frightening, mind you.\r\n",
      "If there's anything queer about him when we once get into the work; in\r\n",
      "for a penny, in for a pound.  You won't see him alive again, Fagin.\r\n",
      "Think of that, before you send him.  Mark my words!' said the robber,\r\n",
      "poising a crowbar, which he had drawn from under the bedstead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I've thought of it all,' said the Jew with energy. 'I've--I've had my\r\n",
      "eye upon him, my dears, close--close. Once let him feel that he is one\r\n",
      "of us; once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief; and\r\n",
      "he's ours!  Ours for his life.  Oho!  It couldn't have come about\r\n",
      "better!  The old man crossed his arms upon his breast; and, drawing his\r\n",
      "head and shoulders into a heap, literally hugged himself for joy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ours!' said Sikes.  'Yours, you mean.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Perhaps I do, my dear,' said the Jew, with a shrill chuckle. 'Mine, if\r\n",
      "you like, Bill.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And wot,' said Sikes, scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend, 'wot\r\n",
      "makes you take so much pains about one chalk-faced kid, when you know\r\n",
      "there are fifty boys snoozing about Common Garden every night, as you\r\n",
      "might pick and choose from?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Because they're of no use to me, my dear,' replied the Jew, with some\r\n",
      "confusion, 'not worth the taking.  Their looks convict 'em when they\r\n",
      "get into trouble, and I lose 'em all.  With this boy, properly managed,\r\n",
      "my dears, I could do what I couldn't with twenty of them.  Besides,'\r\n",
      "said the Jew, recovering his self-possession, 'he has us now if he\r\n",
      "could only give us leg-bail again; and he must be in the same boat with\r\n",
      "us.  Never mind how he came there; it's quite enough for my power over\r\n",
      "him that he was in a robbery; that's all I want.  Now, how much better\r\n",
      "this is, than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the\r\n",
      "way--which would be dangerous, and we should lose by it besides.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'When is it to be done?' asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent\r\n",
      "exclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with\r\n",
      "which he received Fagin's affectation of humanity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah, to be sure,' said the Jew; 'when is it to be done, Bill?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I planned with Toby, the night arter to-morrow,' rejoined Sikes in a\r\n",
      "surly voice, 'if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Good,' said the Jew; 'there's no moon.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' rejoined Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?' asked the Jew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sikes nodded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And about--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, ah, it's all planned,' rejoined Sikes, interrupting him. 'Never\r\n",
      "mind particulars.  You'd better bring the boy here to-morrow night.  I\r\n",
      "shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak.  Then you hold your\r\n",
      "tongue, and keep the melting-pot ready, and that's all you'll have to\r\n",
      "do.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was\r\n",
      "decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew's next evening when the\r\n",
      "night had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily\r\n",
      "observing, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would\r\n",
      "be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in\r\n",
      "his behalf, than anybody else.  It was also solemnly arranged that poor\r\n",
      "Oliver should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be\r\n",
      "unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes;\r\n",
      "and further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought\r\n",
      "fit; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or\r\n",
      "evil that might be necessary to visit him: it being understood that, to\r\n",
      "render the compact in this respect binding, any representations made by\r\n",
      "Mr. Sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and\r\n",
      "corroborated, in all important particulars, by the testimony of flash\r\n",
      "Toby Crackit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a\r\n",
      "furious rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner;\r\n",
      "yelling forth, at the same time, most unmusical snatches of song,\r\n",
      "mingled with wild execrations.  At length, in a fit of professional\r\n",
      "enthusiasm, he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools:\r\n",
      "which he had no sooner stumbled in with, and opened for the purpose of\r\n",
      "explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it\r\n",
      "contained, and the peculiar beauties of their construction, than he\r\n",
      "fell over the box upon the floor, and went to sleep where he fell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Good-night, Nancy,' said the Jew, muffling himself up as before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Good-night.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly.  There was no\r\n",
      "flinching about the girl.  She was as true and earnest in the matter as\r\n",
      "Toby Crackit himself could be.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew again bade her good-night, and, bestowing a sly kick upon the\r\n",
      "prostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her back was turned, groped\r\n",
      "downstairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Always the way!' muttered the Jew to himself as he turned homeward.\r\n",
      "'The worst of these women is, that a very little thing serves to call\r\n",
      "up some long-forgotten feeling; and, the best of them is, that it never\r\n",
      "lasts.  Ha! ha!  The man against the child, for a bag of gold!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr. Fagin wended\r\n",
      "his way, through mud and mire, to his gloomy abode:  where the Dodger\r\n",
      "was sitting up, impatiently awaiting his return.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is Oliver a-bed?  I want to speak to him,' was his first remark as\r\n",
      "they descended the stairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hours ago,' replied the Dodger, throwing open a door.  'Here he is!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale\r\n",
      "with anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his prison, that he\r\n",
      "looked like death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in\r\n",
      "the guise it wears when life has just departed; when a young and gentle\r\n",
      "spirit has, but an instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the\r\n",
      "world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not now,' said the Jew, turning softly away.  'To-morrow. To-morrow.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "CHAPTER XX\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "WHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR. WILLIAM SIKES\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Oliver awoke in the morning, he was a good deal surprised to find\r\n",
      "that a new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been placed at\r\n",
      "his bedside; and that his old shoes had been removed. At first, he was\r\n",
      "pleased with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of\r\n",
      "his release; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his sitting\r\n",
      "down to breakfast along with the Jew, who told him, in a tone and\r\n",
      "manner which increased his alarm, that he was to be taken to the\r\n",
      "residence of Bill Sikes that night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'To--to--stop there, sir?' asked Oliver, anxiously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no, my dear.  Not to stop there,' replied the Jew.  'We shouldn't\r\n",
      "like to lose you.  Don't be afraid, Oliver, you shall come back to us\r\n",
      "again.  Ha! ha! ha!  We won't be so cruel as to send you away, my dear.\r\n",
      "Oh no, no!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread,\r\n",
      "looked round as he bantered Oliver thus; and chuckled as if to show\r\n",
      "that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I suppose,' said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Oliver, 'you want to know\r\n",
      "what you're going to Bill's for---eh, my dear?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver coloured, involuntarily, to find that the old thief had been\r\n",
      "reading his thoughts; but boldly said, Yes, he did want to know.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, do you think?' inquired Fagin, parrying the question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Indeed I don't know, sir,' replied Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bah!' said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance from\r\n",
      "a close perusal of the boy's face.  'Wait till Bill tells you, then.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver's not expressing any greater\r\n",
      "curiosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt\r\n",
      "very anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of\r\n",
      "Fagin's looks, and his own speculations, to make any further inquiries\r\n",
      "just then.  He had no other opportunity:  for the Jew remained very\r\n",
      "surly and silent till night:  when he prepared to go abroad.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You may burn a candle,' said the Jew, putting one upon the table.\r\n",
      "'And here's a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you.\r\n",
      "Good-night!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Good-night!' replied Oliver, softly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he\r\n",
      "went.  Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him to\r\n",
      "light it.  He did so; and, as he placed the candlestick upon the table,\r\n",
      "saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him, with lowering and\r\n",
      "contracted brows, from the dark end of the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Take heed, Oliver! take heed!' said the old man, shaking his right\r\n",
      "hand before him in a warning manner.  'He's a rough man, and thinks\r\n",
      "nothing of blood when his own is up. Whatever falls out, say nothing;\r\n",
      "and do what he bids you.  Mind!'  Placing a strong emphasis on the last\r\n",
      "word, he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a\r\n",
      "ghastly grin, and, nodding his head, left the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared, and\r\n",
      "pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard.  The\r\n",
      "more he thought of the Jew's admonition, the more he was at a loss to\r\n",
      "divine its real purpose and meaning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes,\r\n",
      "which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin;\r\n",
      "and after meditating for a long time, concluded that he had been\r\n",
      "selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker,\r\n",
      "until another boy, better suited for his purpose could be engaged.  He\r\n",
      "was too well accustomed to suffering, and had suffered too much where\r\n",
      "he was, to bewail the prospect of change very severely.  He remained\r\n",
      "lost in thought for some minutes; and then, with a heavy sigh, snuffed\r\n",
      "the candle, and, taking up the book which the Jew had left with him,\r\n",
      "began to read.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned over the leaves.  Carelessly at first; but, lighting on a\r\n",
      "passage which attracted his attention, he soon became intent upon the\r\n",
      "volume.  It was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals;\r\n",
      "and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use. Here, he read of\r\n",
      "dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold; of secret murders that\r\n",
      "had been committed by the lonely wayside; of bodies hidden from the eye\r\n",
      "of man in deep pits and wells: which would not keep them down, deep as\r\n",
      "they were, but had yielded them up at last, after many years, and so\r\n",
      "maddened the murderers with the sight, that in their horror they had\r\n",
      "confessed their guilt, and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony.\r\n",
      "Here, too, he read of men who, lying in their beds at dead of night,\r\n",
      "had been tempted (so they said) and led on, by their own bad thoughts,\r\n",
      "to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep, and the limbs\r\n",
      "quail, to think of.  The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid,\r\n",
      "that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore; and the words upon\r\n",
      "them, to be sounded in his ears, as if they were whispered, in hollow\r\n",
      "murmurs, by the spirits of the dead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a paroxysm of fear, the boy closed the book, and thrust it from him.\r\n",
      "Then, falling upon his knees, he prayed Heaven to spare him from such\r\n",
      "deeds; and rather to will that he should die at once, than be reserved\r\n",
      "for crimes, so fearful and appalling. By degrees, he grew more calm,\r\n",
      "and besought, in a low and broken voice, that he might be rescued from\r\n",
      "his present dangers; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a\r\n",
      "poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred, it\r\n",
      "might come to him now, when, desolate and deserted, he stood alone in\r\n",
      "the midst of wickedness and guilt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had concluded his prayer, but still remained with his head buried in\r\n",
      "his hands, when a rustling noise aroused him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's that!' he cried, starting up, and catching sight of a figure\r\n",
      "standing by the door.  'Who's there?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Me.  Only me,' replied a tremulous voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the door.\r\n",
      "It was Nancy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Put down the light,' said the girl, turning away her head. 'It hurts\r\n",
      "my eyes.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she were ill.\r\n",
      "The girl threw herself into a chair, with her back towards him:  and\r\n",
      "wrung her hands; but made no reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'God forgive me!' she cried after a while, 'I never thought of this.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Has anything happened?' asked Oliver.  'Can I help you?  I will if I\r\n",
      "can.  I will, indeed.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She rocked herself to and fro; caught her throat; and, uttering a\r\n",
      "gurgling sound, gasped for breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nancy!' cried Oliver, 'What is it?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl beat her hands upon her knees, and her feet upon the ground;\r\n",
      "and, suddenly stopping, drew her shawl close round her: and shivered\r\n",
      "with cold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver stirred the fire.  Drawing her chair close to it, she sat there,\r\n",
      "for a little time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head,\r\n",
      "and looked round.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't know what comes over me sometimes,' said she, affecting to\r\n",
      "busy herself in arranging her dress; 'it's this damp dirty room, I\r\n",
      "think.  Now, Nolly, dear, are you ready?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Am I to go with you?' asked Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes.  I have come from Bill,' replied the girl.  'You are to go with\r\n",
      "me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What for?' asked Oliver, recoiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What for?' echoed the girl, raising her eyes, and averting them again,\r\n",
      "the moment they encountered the boy's face.  'Oh!  For no harm.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't believe it,' said Oliver:  who had watched her closely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Have it your own way,' rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh. 'For no\r\n",
      "good, then.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver could see that he had some power over the girl's better\r\n",
      "feelings, and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her compassion\r\n",
      "for his helpless state.  But, then, the thought darted across his mind\r\n",
      "that it was barely eleven o'clock; and that many people were still in\r\n",
      "the streets:  of whom surely some might be found to give credence to\r\n",
      "his tale.  As the reflection occured to him, he stepped forward:  and\r\n",
      "said, somewhat hastily, that he was ready.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Neither his brief consideration, nor its purport, was lost on his\r\n",
      "companion.  She eyed him narrowly, while he spoke; and cast upon him a\r\n",
      "look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what\r\n",
      "had been passing in his thoughts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hush!' said the girl, stooping over him, and pointing to the door as\r\n",
      "she looked cautiously round.  'You can't help yourself. I have tried\r\n",
      "hard for you, but all to no purpose.  You are hedged round and round.\r\n",
      "If ever you are to get loose from here, this is not the time.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Struck by the energy of her manner, Oliver looked up in her face with\r\n",
      "great surprise.  She seemed to speak the truth; her countenance was\r\n",
      "white and agitated; and she trembled with very earnestness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I have saved you from being ill-used once, and I will again, and I do\r\n",
      "now,' continued the girl aloud; 'for those who would have fetched you,\r\n",
      "if I had not, would have been far more rough than me.  I have promised\r\n",
      "for your being quiet and silent; if you are not, you will only do harm\r\n",
      "to yourself and me too, and perhaps be my death.  See here!  I have\r\n",
      "borne all this for you already, as true as God sees me show it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She pointed, hastily, to some livid bruises on her neck and arms; and\r\n",
      "continued, with great rapidity:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Remember this!  And don't let me suffer more for you, just now. If I\r\n",
      "could help you, I would; but I have not the power.  They don't mean to\r\n",
      "harm you; whatever they make you do, is no fault of yours.  Hush!\r\n",
      "Every word from you is a blow for me.  Give me your hand.  Make haste!\r\n",
      "Your hand!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers, and,\r\n",
      "blowing out the light, drew him after her up the stairs. The door was\r\n",
      "opened, quickly, by some one shrouded in the darkness, and was as\r\n",
      "quickly closed, when they had passed out.  A hackney-cabriolet was in\r\n",
      "waiting; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing\r\n",
      "Oliver, the girl pulled him in with her, and drew the curtains close.\r\n",
      "The driver wanted no directions, but lashed his horse into full speed,\r\n",
      "without the delay of an instant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to pour into\r\n",
      "his ear, the warnings and assurances she had already imparted.  All was\r\n",
      "so quick and hurried, that he had scarcely time to recollect where he\r\n",
      "was, or how he came there, when the carriage stopped at the house to\r\n",
      "which the Jew's steps had been directed on the previous evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty\r\n",
      "street, and a cry for help hung upon his lips.  But the girl's voice\r\n",
      "was in his ear, beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her,\r\n",
      "that he had not the heart to utter it. While he hesitated, the\r\n",
      "opportunity was gone; he was already in the house, and the door was\r\n",
      "shut.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This way,' said the girl, releasing her hold for the first time.\r\n",
      "'Bill!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hallo!' replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with a\r\n",
      "candle.  'Oh!  That's the time of day.  Come on!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly hearty\r\n",
      "welcome, from a person of Mr. Sikes' temperament.  Nancy, appearing\r\n",
      "much gratified thereby, saluted him cordially.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bull's-eye's gone home with Tom,' observed Sikes, as he lighted them\r\n",
      "up.  'He'd have been in the way.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's right,' rejoined Nancy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So you've got the kid,' said Sikes when they had all reached the room:\r\n",
      "closing the door as he spoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, here he is,' replied Nancy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Did he come quiet?' inquired Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Like a lamb,' rejoined Nancy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'm glad to hear it,' said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; 'for the\r\n",
      "sake of his young carcase:  as would otherways have suffered for it.\r\n",
      "Come here, young 'un; and let me read you a lectur', which is as well\r\n",
      "got over at once.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus addressing his new pupil, Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver's cap and\r\n",
      "threw it into a corner; and then, taking him by the shoulder, sat\r\n",
      "himself down by the table, and stood the boy in front of him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now, first:  do you know wot this is?' inquired Sikes, taking up a\r\n",
      "pocket-pistol which lay on the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver replied in the affirmative.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, then, look here,' continued Sikes.  'This is powder; that 'ere's\r\n",
      "a bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin'.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to;\r\n",
      "and Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and\r\n",
      "deliberation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now it's loaded,' said Mr. Sikes, when he had finished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, I see it is, sir,' replied Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well,' said the robber, grasping Oliver's wrist, and putting the\r\n",
      "barrel so close to his temple that they touched; at which moment the\r\n",
      "boy could not repress a start; 'if you speak a word when you're out\r\n",
      "o'doors with me, except when I speak to you, that loading will be in\r\n",
      "your head without notice.  So, if you _do_ make up your mind to speak\r\n",
      "without leave, say your prayers first.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to increase\r\n",
      "its effect, Mr. Sikes continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'As near as I know, there isn't anybody as would be asking very\r\n",
      "partickler arter you, if you _was_ disposed of; so I needn't take this\r\n",
      "devil-and-all of trouble to explain matters to you, if it warn't for\r\n",
      "your own good.  D'ye hear me?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The short and the long of what you mean,' said Nancy:  speaking very\r\n",
      "emphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his\r\n",
      "serious attention to her words:  'is, that if you're crossed by him in\r\n",
      "this job you have on hand, you'll prevent his ever telling tales\r\n",
      "afterwards, by shooting him through the head, and will take your chance\r\n",
      "of swinging for it, as you do for a great many other things in the way\r\n",
      "of business, every month of your life.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's it!' observed Mr. Sikes, approvingly; 'women can always put\r\n",
      "things in fewest words.--Except when it's blowing up; and then they\r\n",
      "lengthens it out.  And now that he's thoroughly up to it, let's have\r\n",
      "some supper, and get a snooze before starting.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth;\r\n",
      "disappearing for a few minutes, she presently returned with a pot of\r\n",
      "porter and a dish of sheep's heads: which gave occasion to several\r\n",
      "pleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes, founded upon the singular\r\n",
      "coincidence of 'jemmies' being a can name, common to them, and also to\r\n",
      "an ingenious implement much used in his profession.  Indeed, the worthy\r\n",
      "gentleman, stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on\r\n",
      "active service, was in great spirits and good humour; in proof whereof,\r\n",
      "it may be here remarked, that he humourously drank all the beer at a\r\n",
      "draught, and did not utter, on a rough calculation, more than\r\n",
      "four-score oaths during the whole progress of the meal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Supper being ended--it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great\r\n",
      "appetite for it--Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits\r\n",
      "and water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering Nancy, with many\r\n",
      "imprecations in case of failure, to call him at five precisely.  Oliver\r\n",
      "stretched himself in his clothes, by command of the same authority, on\r\n",
      "a mattress upon the floor; and the girl, mending the fire, sat before\r\n",
      "it, in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that Nancy\r\n",
      "might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice; but the\r\n",
      "girl sat brooding over the fire, without moving, save now and then to\r\n",
      "trim the light.  Weary with watching and anxiety, he at length fell\r\n",
      "asleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he awoke, the table was covered with tea-things, and Sikes was\r\n",
      "thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great-coat, which\r\n",
      "hung over the back of a chair.  Nancy was busily engaged in preparing\r\n",
      "breakfast.  It was not yet daylight; for the candle was still burning,\r\n",
      "and it was quite dark outside. A sharp rain, too, was beating against\r\n",
      "the window-panes; and the sky looked black and cloudy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now, then!' growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; 'half-past five!\r\n",
      "Look sharp, or you'll get no breakfast; for it's late as it is.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver was not long in making his toilet; having taken some breakfast,\r\n",
      "he replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he was quite\r\n",
      "ready.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him a handkerchief to tie\r\n",
      "round his throat; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his\r\n",
      "shoulders.  Thus attired, he gave his hand to the robber, who, merely\r\n",
      "pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same\r\n",
      "pistol in a side-pocket of his great-coat, clasped it firmly in his,\r\n",
      "and, exchanging a farewell with Nancy, led him away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope\r\n",
      "of meeting a look from the girl.  But she had resumed her old seat in\r\n",
      "front of the fire, and sat, perfectly motionless before it.\r\n",

      "CHAPTER XXI\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "THE EXPEDITION\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing and\r\n",
      "raining hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy.  The night had\r\n",
      "been very wet: large pools of water had collected in the road: and the\r\n",
      "kennels were overflowing.  There was a faint glimmering of the coming\r\n",
      "day in the sky; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the\r\n",
      "scene:  the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street\r\n",
      "lamps afforded, without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the\r\n",
      "wet house-tops, and dreary streets.  There appeared to be nobody\r\n",
      "stirring in that quarter of the town; the windows of the houses were\r\n",
      "all closely shut; and the streets through which they passed, were\r\n",
      "noiseless and empty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road, the day had\r\n",
      "fairly begun to break.  Many of the lamps were already extinguished; a\r\n",
      "few country waggons were slowly toiling on, towards London; now and\r\n",
      "then, a stage-coach, covered with mud, rattled briskly by: the driver\r\n",
      "bestowing, as he passed, an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner\r\n",
      "who, by keeping on the wrong side of the road, had endangered his\r\n",
      "arriving at the office, a quarter of a minute after his time.  The\r\n",
      "public-houses, with gas-lights burning inside, were already open.  By\r\n",
      "degrees, other shops began to be unclosed, and a few scattered people\r\n",
      "were met with.  Then, came straggling groups of labourers going to\r\n",
      "their work; then, men and women with fish-baskets on their heads;\r\n",
      "donkey-carts laden with vegetables; chaise-carts filled with live-stock\r\n",
      "or whole carcasses of meat; milk-women with pails; an unbroken\r\n",
      "concourse of people, trudging out with various supplies to the eastern\r\n",
      "suburbs of the town.  As they approached the City, the noise and\r\n",
      "traffic gradually increased; when they threaded the streets between\r\n",
      "Shoreditch and Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound and\r\n",
      "bustle.  It was as light as it was likely to be, till night came on\r\n",
      "again, and the busy morning of half the London population had begun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square,\r\n",
      "Mr. Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into\r\n",
      "Long Lane, and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a\r\n",
      "tumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was market-morning.  The ground was covered, nearly ankle-deep, with\r\n",
      "filth and mire; a thick steam, perpetually rising from the reeking\r\n",
      "bodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog, which seemed to rest\r\n",
      "upon the chimney-tops, hung heavily above.  All the pens in the centre\r\n",
      "of the large area, and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into\r\n",
      "the vacant space, were filled with sheep; tied up to posts by the\r\n",
      "gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen, three or four deep.\r\n",
      "Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and\r\n",
      "vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a mass; the\r\n",
      "whistling of drovers, the barking dogs, the bellowing and plunging of\r\n",
      "the oxen, the bleating of sheep, the grunting and squeaking of pigs,\r\n",
      "the cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling on all sides;\r\n",
      "the ringing of bells and roar of voices, that issued from every\r\n",
      "public-house; the crowding, pushing, driving, beating, whooping and\r\n",
      "yelling; the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every\r\n",
      "corner of the market; and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty\r\n",
      "figures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the\r\n",
      "throng; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite\r\n",
      "confounded the senses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him, elbowed his way through the\r\n",
      "thickest of the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the\r\n",
      "numerous sights and sounds, which so astonished the boy.  He nodded,\r\n",
      "twice or thrice, to a passing friend; and, resisting as many\r\n",
      "invitations to take a morning dram, pressed steadily onward, until they\r\n",
      "were clear of the turmoil, and had made their way through Hosier Lane\r\n",
      "into Holborn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now, young 'un!' said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St. Andrew's\r\n",
      "Church, 'hard upon seven! you must step out.  Come, don't lag behind\r\n",
      "already, Lazy-legs!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion's\r\n",
      "wrist; Oliver, quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast\r\n",
      "walk and a run, kept up with the rapid strides of the house-breaker as\r\n",
      "well as he could.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They held their course at this rate, until they had passed Hyde Park\r\n",
      "corner, and were on their way to Kensington:  when Sikes relaxed his\r\n",
      "pace, until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind,\r\n",
      "came up.  Seeing 'Hounslow' written on it, he asked the driver with as\r\n",
      "much civility as he could assume, if he would give them a lift as far\r\n",
      "as Isleworth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Jump up,' said the man.  'Is that your boy?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes; he's my boy,' replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and putting\r\n",
      "his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Your father walks rather too quick for you, don't he, my man?'\r\n",
      "inquired the driver: seeing that Oliver was out of breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not a bit of it,' replied Sikes, interposing.  'He's used to it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here, take hold of my hand, Ned.  In with you!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus addressing Oliver, he helped him into the cart; and the driver,\r\n",
      "pointing to a heap of sacks, told him to lie down there, and rest\r\n",
      "himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As they passed the different mile-stones, Oliver wondered, more and\r\n",
      "more, where his companion meant to take him.  Kensington, Hammersmith,\r\n",
      "Chiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed; and yet they went on\r\n",
      "as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey.  At length,\r\n",
      "they came to a public-house called the Coach and Horses; a little way\r\n",
      "beyond which, another road appeared to run off.  And here, the cart\r\n",
      "stopped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sikes dismounted with great precipitation, holding Oliver by the hand\r\n",
      "all the while; and lifting him down directly, bestowed a furious look\r\n",
      "upon him, and rapped the side-pocket with his fist, in a significant\r\n",
      "manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Good-bye, boy,' said the man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He's sulky,' replied Sikes, giving him a shake; 'he's sulky.  A young\r\n",
      "dog!  Don't mind him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not I!' rejoined the other, getting into his cart.  'It's a fine day,\r\n",
      "after all.'  And he drove away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sikes waited until he had fairly gone; and then, telling Oliver he\r\n",
      "might look about him if he wanted, once again led him onward on his\r\n",
      "journey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They turned round to the left, a short way past the public-house; and\r\n",
      "then, taking a right-hand road, walked on for a long time: passing many\r\n",
      "large gardens and gentlemen's houses on both sides of the way, and\r\n",
      "stopping for nothing but a little beer, until they reached a town.\r\n",
      "Here against the wall of a house, Oliver saw written up in pretty large\r\n",
      "letters, 'Hampton.'  They lingered about, in the fields, for some\r\n",
      "hours.  At length they came back into the town; and, turning into an\r\n",
      "old public-house with a defaced sign-board, ordered some dinner by the\r\n",
      "kitchen fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The kitchen was an old, low-roofed room; with a great beam across the\r\n",
      "middle of the ceiling, and benches, with high backs to them, by the\r\n",
      "fire; on which were seated several rough men in smock-frocks, drinking\r\n",
      "and smoking.  They took no notice of Oliver; and very little of Sikes;\r\n",
      "and, as Sikes took very little notice of them, he and his young comrade\r\n",
      "sat in a corner by themselves, without being much troubled by their\r\n",

      "They had some cold meat for dinner, and sat so long after it, while Mr.\r\n",
      "Sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes, that Oliver began to\r\n",
      "feel quite certain they were not going any further.  Being much tired\r\n",
      "with the walk, and getting up so early, he dozed a little at first;\r\n",
      "then, quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell\r\n",
      "asleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes. Rousing\r\n",
      "himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him, he found that worthy\r\n",
      "in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man, over a pint\r\n",
      "of ale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So, you're going on to Lower Halliford, are you?' inquired Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, I am,' replied the man, who seemed a little the worse--or better,\r\n",
      "as the case might be--for drinking; 'and not slow about it neither.  My\r\n",
      "horse hasn't got a load behind him going back, as he had coming up in\r\n",
      "the mornin'; and he won't be long a-doing of it.  Here's luck to him.\r\n",
      "Ecod! he's a good 'un!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?' demanded Sikes,\r\n",
      "pushing the ale towards his new friend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If you're going directly, I can,' replied the man, looking out of the\r\n",
      "pot.  'Are you going to Halliford?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Going on to Shepperton,' replied Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'm your man, as far as I go,' replied the other.  'Is all paid,\r\n",
      "Becky?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, the other gentleman's paid,' replied the girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I say!' said the man, with tipsy gravity; 'that won't do, you know.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why not?' rejoined Sikes.  'You're a-going to accommodate us, and\r\n",
      "wot's to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so, in return?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The stranger reflected upon this argument, with a very profound face;\r\n",
      "having done so, he seized Sikes by the hand:  and declared he was a\r\n",
      "real good fellow.  To which Mr. Sikes replied, he was joking; as, if he\r\n",
      "had been sober, there would have been strong reason to suppose he was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After the exchange of a few more compliments, they bade the company\r\n",
      "good-night, and went out; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as\r\n",
      "they did so, and lounging out to the door, with her hands full, to see\r\n",
      "the party start.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The horse, whose health had been drunk in his absence, was standing\r\n",
      "outside:  ready harnessed to the cart.  Oliver and Sikes got in without\r\n",
      "any further ceremony; and the man to whom he belonged, having lingered\r\n",
      "for a minute or two 'to bear him up,' and to defy the hostler and the\r\n",
      "world to produce his equal, mounted also.  Then, the hostler was told\r\n",
      "to give the horse his head; and, his head being given him, he made a\r\n",
      "very unpleasant use of it:  tossing it into the air with great disdain,\r\n",
      "and running into the parlour windows over the way; after performing\r\n",
      "those feats, and supporting himself for a short time on his hind-legs,\r\n",
      "he started off at great speed, and rattled out of the town right\r\n",
      "gallantly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The night was very dark.  A damp mist rose from the river, and the\r\n",
      "marshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields.  It was\r\n",
      "piercing cold, too; all was gloomy and black. Not a word was spoken;\r\n",
      "for the driver had grown sleepy; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him\r\n",
      "into conversation.  Oliver sat huddled together, in a corner of the\r\n",
      "cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange\r\n",
      "objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as\r\n",
      "if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As they passed Sunbury Church, the clock struck seven.  There was a\r\n",
      "light in the ferry-house window opposite:  which streamed across the\r\n",
      "road, and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew-tree with graves\r\n",
      "beneath it.  There was a dull sound of falling water not far off; and\r\n",
      "the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind.  It seemed\r\n",
      "like quiet music for the repose of the dead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely road.\r\n",
      "Two or three miles more, and the cart stopped.  Sikes alighted, took\r\n",
      "Oliver by the hand, and they once again walked on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They turned into no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had expected;\r\n",
      "but still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes\r\n",
      "and over cold open wastes, until they came within sight of the lights\r\n",
      "of a town at no great distance.  On looking intently forward, Oliver\r\n",
      "saw that the water was just below them, and that they were coming to\r\n",
      "the foot of a bridge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then\r\n",
      "turned suddenly down a bank upon the left.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The water!' thought Oliver, turning sick with fear.  'He has brought\r\n",
      "me to this lonely place to murder me!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was about to throw himself on the ground, and make one struggle for\r\n",
      "his young life, when he saw that they stood before a solitary house:\r\n",
      "all ruinous and decayed.  There was a window on each side of the\r\n",
      "dilapidated entrance; and one story above; but no light was visible.\r\n",
      "The house was dark, dismantled: and the all appearance, uninhabited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sikes, with Oliver's hand still in his, softly approached the low\r\n",
      "porch, and raised the latch.  The door yielded to the pressure, and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A pair of slipshod feet shuffled, hastily, across the bare floor of the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Muttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him;\r\n",
      "and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken\r\n",
      "chairs, a table, and a very old couch:  on which, with his legs much\r\n",
      "higher than his head, a man was reposing at full length, smoking a long\r\n",
      "clay pipe.  He was dressed in a smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat, with\r\n",
      "large brass buttons; an orange neckerchief; a coarse, staring,\r\n",
      "shawl-pattern waistcoat; and drab breeches.  Mr. Crackit (for he it\r\n",
      "was) had no very great quantity of hair, either upon his head or face;\r\n",
      "but what he had, was of a reddish dye, and tortured into long corkscrew\r\n",
      "curls, through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers,\r\n",
      "ornamented with large common rings.  He was a trifle above the middle\r\n",
      "size, and apparently rather weak in the legs; but this circumstance by\r\n",
      "no means detracted from his own admiration of his top-boots, which he\r\n",
      "contemplated, in their elevated situation, with lively satisfaction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bill, my boy!' said this figure, turning his head towards the door,\r\n",
      "'I'm glad to see you.  I was almost afraid you'd given it up:  in which\r\n",
      "case I should have made a personal wentur.  Hallo!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his eyes\r\n",
      "rested on Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting\r\n",
      "posture, and demanded who that was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The boy.  Only the boy!' replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the\r\n",

      "'Wud of Bister Fagid's lads,' exclaimed Barney, with a grin.\r\n",

      "'Fagin's, eh!' exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver.  'Wot an inwalable\r\n",
      "boy that'll make, for the old ladies' pockets in chapels!  His mug is a\r\n",
      "fortin' to him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There--there's enough of that,' interposed Sikes, impatiently; and\r\n",
      "stooping over his recumbant friend, he whispered a few words in his\r\n",
      "ear:  at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with\r\n",
      "a long stare of astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now,' said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, 'if you'll give us something\r\n",
      "to eat and drink while we're waiting, you'll put some heart in us; or\r\n",
      "in me, at all events.  Sit down by the fire, younker, and rest\r\n",
      "yourself; for you'll have to go out with us again to-night, though not\r\n",
      "very far off.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool\r\n",
      "to the fire, sat with his aching head upon his hands, scarecely knowing\r\n",
      "where he was, or what was passing around him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Here,' said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of food, and\r\n",
      "a bottle upon the table,  'Success to the crack!'  He rose to honour\r\n",
      "the toast; and, carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner,\r\n",
      "advanced to the table, filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its\r\n",
      "contents.  Mr. Sikes did the same.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A drain for the boy,' said Toby, half-filling a wine-glass. 'Down with\r\n",
      "it, innocence.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Indeed,' said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man's face;\r\n",
      "'indeed, I--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Down with it!' echoed Toby.  'Do you think I don't know what's good\r\n",
      "for you?  Tell him to drink it, Bill.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He had better!' said Sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket. 'Burn my\r\n",
      "body, if he isn't more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers.  Drink\r\n",
      "it, you perwerse imp; drink it!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily\r\n",
      "swallowed the contents of the glass, and immediately fell into a\r\n",
      "violent fit of coughing:  which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney, and\r\n",
      "even drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This done, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Oliver could eat\r\n",
      "nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow), the\r\n",
      "two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap.  Oliver\r\n",
      "retained his stool by the fire; Barney wrapped in a blanket, stretched\r\n",
      "himself on the floor:  close outside the fender.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody stirring but\r\n",
      "Barney, who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire. Oliver fell\r\n",
      "into a heavy doze:  imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes,\r\n",
      "or wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other\r\n",
      "of the scenes of the past day:  when he was roused by Toby Crackit\r\n",
      "jumping up and declaring it was half-past one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In an instant, the other two were on their legs, and all were actively\r\n",
      "engaged in busy preparation.  Sikes and his companion enveloped their\r\n",
      "necks and chins in large dark shawls, and drew on their great-coats;\r\n",
      "Barney, opening a cupboard, brought forth several articles, which he\r\n",
      "hastily crammed into the pockets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Barkers for me, Barney,' said Toby Crackit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Here they are,' replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols. 'You\r\n",
      "loaded them yourself.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'All right!' replied Toby, stowing them away.  'The persuaders?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I've got 'em,' replied Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Crape, keys, centre-bits, darkies--nothing forgotten?' inquired Toby:\r\n",
      "fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'All right,' rejoined his companion.  'Bring them bits of timber,\r\n",
      "Barney.  That's the time of day.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words, he took a thick stick from Barney's hands, who,\r\n",
      "having delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on\r\n",
      "Oliver's cape.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now then!' said Sikes, holding out his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver:  who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the\r\n",
      "air, and the drink which had been forced upon him:  put his hand\r\n",
      "mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Take his other hand, Toby,' said Sikes.  'Look out, Barney.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was quiet.\r\n",
      "The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them. Barney, having\r\n",
      "made all fast, rolled himself up as before, and was soon asleep again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was now intensely dark.  The fog was much heavier than it had been\r\n",
      "in the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that,\r\n",
      "although no rain fell, Oliver's hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes\r\n",
      "after leaving the house, had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture\r\n",
      "that was floating about.  They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards\r\n",
      "the lights which he had seen before.  They were at no great distance\r\n",
      "off; and, as they walked pretty briskly, they soon arrived at Chertsey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Slap through the town,' whispered Sikes; 'there'll be nobody in the\r\n",
      "way, to-night, to see us.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Toby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little\r\n",
      "town, which at that late hour was wholly deserted.  A dim light shone\r\n",
      "at intervals from some bed-room window; and the hoarse barking of dogs\r\n",
      "occasionally broke the silence of the night.  But there was nobody\r\n",
      "abroad.  They had cleared the town, as the church-bell struck two.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Quickening their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand. After\r\n",
      "walking about a quarter of a mile, they stopped before a detached house\r\n",
      "surrounded by a wall:  to the top of which, Toby Crackit, scarcely\r\n",
      "pausing to take breath, climbed in a twinkling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The boy next,' said Toby.  'Hoist him up; I'll catch hold of him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the\r\n",
      "arms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass\r\n",
      "on the other side.  Sikes followed directly.  And they stole cautiously\r\n",
      "towards the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now, for the first time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and\r\n",
      "terror, saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the\r\n",
      "objects of the expedition.  He clasped his hands together, and\r\n",
      "involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror.  A mist came\r\n",
      "before his eyes; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face; his limbs\r\n",
      "failed him; and he sank upon his knees.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Get up!' murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the pistol\r\n",
      "from his pocket; 'Get up, or I'll strew your brains upon the grass.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh! for God's sake let me go!' cried Oliver; 'let me run away and die\r\n",
      "in the fields.  I will never come near London; never, never!  Oh! pray\r\n",
      "have mercy on me, and do not make me steal.  For the love of all the\r\n",
      "bright Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had\r\n",
      "cocked the pistol, when Toby, striking it from his grasp, placed his\r\n",
      "hand upon the boy's mouth, and dragged him to the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hush!' cried the man; 'it won't answer here.  Say another word, and\r\n",
      "I'll do your business myself with a crack on the head.  That makes no\r\n",
      "noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel.  Here, Bill, wrench\r\n",
      "the shutter open.  He's game enough now, I'll engage.  I've seen older\r\n",
      "hands of his age took the same way, for a minute or two, on a cold\r\n",
      "night.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin's head for sending\r\n",
      "Oliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little\r\n",
      "noise.  After some delay, and some assistance from Toby, the shutter to\r\n",
      "which he had referred, swung open on its hinges.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a little lattice window, about five feet and a half above the\r\n",
      "ground, at the back of the house:  which belonged to a scullery, or\r\n",
      "small brewing-place, at the end of the passage.  The aperture was so\r\n",
      "small, that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to\r\n",
      "defend it more securely; but it was large enough to admit a boy of\r\n",
      "Oliver's size, nevertheless.  A very brief exercise of Mr. Sike's art,\r\n",
      "sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice; and it soon stood\r\n",
      "wide open also.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now listen, you young limb,' whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern\r\n",
      "from his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver's face; 'I'm a\r\n",
      "going to put you through there.  Take this light; go softly up the\r\n",
      "steps straight afore you, and along the little hall, to the street\r\n",
      "door; unfasten it, and let us in.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There's a bolt at the top, you won't be able to reach,' interposed\r\n",
      "Toby. 'Stand upon one of the hall chairs.  There are three there, Bill,\r\n",
      "with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on 'em:  which is\r\n",
      "the old lady's arms.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Keep quiet, can't you?' replied Sikes, with a threatening look. 'The\r\n",
      "room-door is open, is it?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Wide,' replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself. 'The game of\r\n",
      "that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so that the dog,\r\n",
      "who's got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he feels\r\n",
      "wakeful.  Ha! ha! Barney 'ticed him away to-night.  So neat!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and laughed\r\n",
      "without noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent, and to get\r\n",
      "to work.  Toby complied, by first producing his lantern, and placing it\r\n",
      "on the ground; then by planting himself firmly with his head against\r\n",
      "the wall beneath the window, and his hands upon his knees, so as to\r\n",
      "make a step of his back. This was no sooner done, than Sikes, mounting\r\n",
      "upon him, put Oliver gently through the window with his feet first;\r\n",
      "and, without leaving hold of his collar, planted him safely on the\r\n",
      "floor inside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Take this lantern,' said Sikes, looking into the room.  'You see the\r\n",
      "stairs afore you?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, 'Yes.'  Sikes, pointing to\r\n",
      "the street-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him to take\r\n",
      "notice that he was within shot all the way; and that if he faltered, he\r\n",
      "would fall dead that instant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's done in a minute,' said Sikes, in the same low whisper. 'Directly\r\n",
      "I leave go of you, do your work.  Hark!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's that?' whispered the other man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They listened intently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing,' said Sikes, releasing his hold of Oliver.  'Now!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the short time he had had to collect his senses, the boy had firmly\r\n",
      "resolved that, whether he died in the attempt or not, he would make one\r\n",
      "effort to dart upstairs from the hall, and alarm the family.  Filled\r\n",
      "with this idea, he advanced at once, but stealthily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come back!' suddenly cried Sikes aloud.  'Back! back!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and\r\n",
      "by a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew\r\n",
      "not whether to advance or fly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cry was repeated--a light appeared--a vision of two terrified\r\n",
      "half-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes--a\r\n",
      "flash--a loud noise--a smoke--a crash somewhere, but where he knew\r\n",
      "not,--and he staggered back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had him\r\n",
      "by the collar before the smoke had cleared away.  He fired his own\r\n",
      "pistol after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy\r\n",
      "up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Clasp your arm tighter,' said Sikes, as he drew him through the\r\n",
      "window.  'Give me a shawl here.  They've hit him.  Quick!  How the boy\r\n",
      "bleeds!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of\r\n",
      "fire-arms, and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being carried\r\n",
      "over uneven ground at a rapid pace.  And then, the noises grew confused\r\n",
      "in the distance; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy's heart;\r\n",
      "and he saw or heard no more.\r\n",

      "The night was bitter cold.  The snow lay on the ground, frozen into a\r\n",
      "hard thick crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways\r\n",
      "and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad:  which,\r\n",
      "as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found, caught it\r\n",
      "savagely up in clouds, and, whirling it into a thousand misty eddies,\r\n",
      "scattered it in air.  Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night\r\n",
      "for the well-housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank God\r\n",
      "they were at home; and for the homeless, starving wretch to lay him\r\n",

      "can hardly open them in a more bitter world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the\r\n",
      "matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already\r\n",
      "introduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a\r\n",
      "cheerful fire in her own little room, and glanced, with no small degree\r\n",
      "of complacency, at a small round table:  on which stood a tray of\r\n",
      "corresponding size, furnished with all necessary materials for the most\r\n",
      "grateful meal that matrons enjoy.  In fact, Mrs. Corney was about to\r\n",
      "solace herself with a cup of tea. As she glanced from the table to the\r\n",
      "fireplace, where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a\r\n",
      "small song in a small voice, her inward satisfaction evidently\r\n",
      "increased,--so much so, indeed, that Mrs. Corney smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well!' said the matron, leaning her elbow on the table, and looking\r\n",
      "reflectively at the fire; 'I'm sure we have all on us a great deal to\r\n",
      "be grateful for!  A great deal, if we did but know it.  Ah!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Corney shook her head mournfully, as if deploring the mental\r\n",
      "blindness of those paupers who did not know it; and thrusting a silver\r\n",
      "spoon (private property) into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin\r\n",
      "tea-caddy, proceeded to make the tea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds!  The\r\n",
      "black teapot, being very small and easily filled, ran over while Mrs.\r\n",
      "Corney was moralising; and the water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney's\r\n",
      "hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Drat the pot!' said the worthy matron, setting it down very hastily on\r\n",
      "the hob; 'a little stupid thing, that only holds a couple of cups!\r\n",
      "What use is it of, to anybody!  Except,' said Mrs. Corney, pausing,\r\n",
      "'except to a poor desolate creature like me.  Oh dear!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words, the matron dropped into her chair, and, once more\r\n",
      "resting her elbow on the table, thought of her solitary fate.  The\r\n",
      "small teapot, and the single cup, had awakened in her mind sad\r\n",
      "recollections of Mr. Corney (who had not been dead more than\r\n",
      "five-and-twenty years); and she was overpowered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I shall never get another!' said Mrs. Corney, pettishly; 'I shall\r\n",
      "never get another--like him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whether this remark bore reference to the husband, or the teapot, is\r\n",
      "uncertain.  It might have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney looked at it\r\n",
      "as she spoke; and took it up afterwards.  She had just tasted her first\r\n",
      "cup, when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room-door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, come in with you!' said Mrs. Corney, sharply.  'Some of the old\r\n",
      "women dying, I suppose.  They always die when I'm at meals. Don't stand\r\n",
      "there, letting the cold air in, don't.  What's amiss now, eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing, ma'am, nothing,' replied a man's voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Dear me!' exclaimed the matron, in a much sweeter tone, 'is that Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'At your service, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping\r\n",
      "outside to rub his shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his coat; and\r\n",
      "who now made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a\r\n",
      "bundle in the other.  'Shall I shut the door, ma'am?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any\r\n",
      "impropriety in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble, with closed doors.\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation, and being very cold\r\n",
      "himself, shut it without permission.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hard weather, Mr. Bumble,' said the matron.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hard, indeed, ma'am,' replied the beadle.  'Anti-porochial weather\r\n",
      "this, ma'am.  We have given away, Mrs. Corney, we have given away a\r\n",
      "matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half, this very\r\n",
      "blessed afternoon; and yet them paupers are not contented.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Of course not.  When would they be, Mr. Bumble?' said the matron,\r\n",
      "sipping her tea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'When, indeed, ma'am!' rejoined Mr. Bumble.  'Why here's one man that,\r\n",
      "in consideration of his wife and large family, has a quartern loaf and\r\n",
      "a good pound of cheese, full weight.  Is he grateful, ma'am?  Is he\r\n",
      "grateful?  Not a copper farthing's worth of it!  What does he do,\r\n",
      "ma'am, but ask for a few coals; if it's only a pocket handkerchief\r\n",
      "full, he says!  Coals! What would he do with coals?  Toast his cheese\r\n",
      "with 'em and then come back for more.  That's the way with these\r\n",
      "people, ma'am; give 'em a apron full of coals to-day, and they'll come\r\n",
      "back for another, the day after to-morrow, as brazen as alabaster.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible\r\n",
      "simile; and the beadle went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I never,' said Mr. Bumble, 'see anything like the pitch it's got to.\r\n",
      "The day afore yesterday, a man--you have been a married woman, ma'am,\r\n",
      "and I may mention it to you--a man, with hardly a rag upon his back\r\n",
      "(here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor), goes to our overseer's door\r\n",
      "when he has got company coming to dinner; and says, he must be\r\n",
      "relieved, Mrs. Corney.  As he wouldn't go away, and shocked the company\r\n",
      "very much, our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a\r\n",
      "pint of oatmeal.  \"My heart!\" says the ungrateful villain, \"what's the\r\n",
      "use of _this_ to me?  You might as well give me a pair of iron\r\n",
      "spectacles!\"  \"Very good,\" says our overseer, taking 'em away again,\r\n",
      "\"you won't get anything else here.\"  \"Then I'll die in the streets!\"\r\n",
      "says the vagrant.  \"Oh no, you won't,\" says our overseer.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ha! ha!  That was very good!  So like Mr. Grannett, wasn't it?'\r\n",
      "interposed the matron.  'Well, Mr. Bumble?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, ma'am,' rejoined the beadle, 'he went away; and he _did_ die in\r\n",
      "the streets.  There's a obstinate pauper for you!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It beats anything I could have believed,' observed the matron\r\n",
      "emphatically.  'But don't you think out-of-door relief a very bad\r\n",
      "thing, any way, Mr. Bumble?  You're a gentleman of experience, and\r\n",
      "ought to know.  Come.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mrs. Corney,' said the beadle, smiling as men smile who are conscious\r\n",
      "of superior information, 'out-of-door relief, properly managed:\r\n",
      "properly managed, ma'am: is the porochial safeguard.  The great\r\n",
      "principle of out-of-door relief is, to give the paupers exactly what\r\n",
      "they don't want; and then they get tired of coming.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Dear me!' exclaimed Mrs. Corney.  'Well, that is a good one, too!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes.  Betwixt you and me, ma'am,' returned Mr. Bumble, 'that's the\r\n",
      "great principle; and that's the reason why, if you look at any cases\r\n",
      "that get into them owdacious newspapers, you'll always observe that\r\n",
      "sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese.  That's the\r\n",
      "rule now, Mrs. Corney, all over the country. But, however,' said the\r\n",
      "beadle, stopping to unpack his bundle, 'these are official secrets,\r\n",
      "ma'am; not to be spoken of; except, as I may say, among the porochial\r\n",
      "officers, such as ourselves. This is the port wine, ma'am, that the\r\n",
      "board ordered for the infirmary; real, fresh, genuine port wine; only\r\n",
      "out of the cask this forenoon; clear as a bell, and no sediment!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to\r\n",
      "test its excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of\r\n",
      "drawers; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped; put it\r\n",
      "carefully in his pocket; and took up his hat, as if to go.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You'll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,' said the matron.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It blows, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his coat-collar,\r\n",
      "'enough to cut one's ears off.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The matron looked, from the little kettle, to the beadle, who was\r\n",
      "moving towards the door; and as the beadle coughed, preparatory to\r\n",
      "bidding her good-night, bashfully inquired whether--whether he wouldn't\r\n",
      "take a cup of tea?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again; laid his hat\r\n",
      "and stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table.  As he\r\n",
      "slowly seated himself, he looked at the lady.  She fixed her eyes upon\r\n",
      "the little teapot.  Mr. Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet. As she\r\n",
      "sat down, her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle;\r\n",
      "she coloured, and applied herself to the task of making his tea.  Again\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble coughed--louder this time than he had coughed yet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Sweet?  Mr. Bumble?' inquired the matron, taking up the sugar-basin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Very sweet, indeed, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble.  He fixed his eyes on\r\n",
      "Mrs. Corney as he said this; and if ever a beadle looked tender, Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble was that beadle at that moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tea was made, and handed in silence.  Mr. Bumble, having spread a\r\n",
      "handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the\r\n",
      "splendour of his shorts, began to eat and drink; varying these\r\n",
      "amusements, occasionally, by fetching a deep sigh; which, however, had\r\n",
      "no injurious effect upon his appetite, but, on the contrary, rather\r\n",
      "seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You have a cat, ma'am, I see,' said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one who,\r\n",
      "in the centre of her family, was basking before the fire; 'and kittens\r\n",
      "too, I declare!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can't think,' replied the\r\n",
      "matron.  'They're _so_ happy, _so_ frolicsome, and _so_ cheerful, that\r\n",
      "they are quite companions for me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Very nice animals, ma'am,' replied Mr. Bumble, approvingly; 'so very\r\n",
      "domestic.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, yes!' rejoined the matron with enthusiasm; 'so fond of their home\r\n",
      "too, that it's quite a pleasure, I'm sure.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mrs. Corney, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking the time\r\n",
      "with his teaspoon, 'I mean to say this, ma'am; that any cat, or kitten,\r\n",
      "that could live with you, ma'am, and _not_ be fond of its home, must be\r\n",
      "a ass, ma'am.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, Mr. Bumble!' remonstrated Mrs. Corney.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's of no use disguising facts, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble, slowly\r\n",
      "flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him\r\n",
      "doubly impressive; 'I would drown it myself, with pleasure.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then you're a cruel man,' said the matron vivaciously, as she held out\r\n",
      "her hand for the beadle's cup; 'and a very hard-hearted man besides.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hard-hearted, ma'am?' said Mr. Bumble.  'Hard?'  Mr. Bumble resigned\r\n",
      "his cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney's little finger as\r\n",
      "she took it; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his laced\r\n",
      "waistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little\r\n",
      "morsel farther from the fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been\r\n",
      "sitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and\r\n",
      "fronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from\r\n",
      "the fire, and still keeping at the table, increased the distance\r\n",
      "between himself and Mrs. Corney; which proceeding, some prudent readers\r\n",
      "will doubtless be disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great\r\n",
      "heroism on Mr. Bumble's part:  he being in some sort tempted by time,\r\n",
      "place, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings,\r\n",
      "which however well they may become the lips of the light and\r\n",
      "thoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the\r\n",
      "land, members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other\r\n",
      "great public functionaries, but more particularly beneath the\r\n",
      "stateliness and gravity of a beadle:  who (as is well known) should be\r\n",
      "the sternest and most inflexible among them all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whatever were Mr. Bumble's intentions, however (and no doubt they were\r\n",
      "of the best): it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before\r\n",
      "remarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble,\r\n",
      "moving his chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the\r\n",
      "distance between himself and the matron; and, continuing to travel\r\n",
      "round the outer edge of the circle, brought his chair, in time, close\r\n",
      "to that in which the matron was seated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Indeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble\r\n",
      "stopped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, if the matron had moved her chair to the right, she would have\r\n",
      "been scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she must have fallen\r\n",
      "into Mr. Bumble's arms; so (being a discreet matron, and no doubt\r\n",
      "foreseeing these consequences at a glance) she remained where she was,\r\n",
      "and handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?' said Mr. Bumble, stirring his tea, and\r\n",
      "looking up into the matron's face; 'are _you_ hard-hearted, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Corney?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Dear me!' exclaimed the matron, 'what a very curious question from a\r\n",
      "single man.  What can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The beadle drank his tea to the last drop; finished a piece of toast;\r\n",
      "whisked the crumbs off his knees; wiped his lips; and deliberately\r\n",

      "As the lady had stated her intention of screaming, of course she would\r\n",

      "rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door:  which was no\r\n",
      "sooner heard, than Mr. Bumble darted, with much agility, to the wine\r\n",

      "'No, no, mistress,' replied the old woman, 'nobody can; she's far\r\n",

      "and great strong men; and I know when death's a-coming, well enough.\r\n",

      "the same, and made rare fun of it afterwards.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ay, that she would,' rejoined the other; 'she had a merry heart. 'A\r\n",
      "many, many, beautiful corpses she laid out, as nice and neat as\r\n",
      "waxwork.  My old eyes have seen them--ay, and those old hands touched\r\n",

      "more into her own.  While they were thus employed, the matron, who had\r\n",

      "nothing.  It's no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house\r\n",

      "If you make a fool of me again, I'll soon cure you, I warrant you!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was bouncing away, when a cry from the two women, who had turned\r\n",
      "towards the bed, caused her to look round.  The patient had raised\r\n",
      "herself upright, and was stretching her arms towards them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Who's that?' she cried, in a hollow voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "down!'\r\n",

      "'I'll never lie down again alive!' said the woman, struggling. 'I\r\n",
      "_will_ tell her!  Come here!  Nearer!  Let me whisper in your ear.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She clutched the matron by the arm, and forcing her into a chair by the\r\n",
      "bedside, was about to speak, when looking round, she caught sight of\r\n",
      "the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Turn them away,' said the woman, drowsily; 'make haste! make haste!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two old crones, chiming in together, began pouring out many piteous\r\n",
      "lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best\r\n",
      "friends; and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never\r\n",
      "leave her, when the superior pushed them from the room, closed the\r\n",
      "door, and returned to the bedside.  On being excluded, the old ladies\r\n",
      "changed their tone, and cried through the keyhole that old Sally was\r\n",
      "drunk; which, indeed, was not unlikely; since, in addition to a\r\n",
      "moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary, she was labouring\r\n",
      "under the effects of a final taste of gin-and-water which had been\r\n",
      "privily administered, in the openness of their hearts, by the worthy\r\n",
      "old ladies themselves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now listen to me,' said the dying woman aloud, as if making a great\r\n",
      "effort to revive one latent spark of energy.  'In this very room--in\r\n",
      "this very bed--I once nursed a pretty young creetur', that was brought\r\n",
      "into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking, and all\r\n",
      "soiled with dust and blood.  She gave birth to a boy, and died.  Let me\r\n",
      "think--what was the year again!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Never mind the year,' said the impatient auditor; 'what about her?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ay,' murmured the sick woman, relapsing into her former drowsy state,\r\n",
      "'what about her?--what about--I know!' she cried, jumping fiercely up:\r\n",
      "her face flushed, and her eyes starting from her head--'I robbed her,\r\n",
      "so I did!  She wasn't cold--I tell you she wasn't cold, when I stole\r\n",
      "it!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "she would call for help.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'_It_!' replied the woman, laying her hand over the other's mouth. 'The\r\n",
      "only thing she had.  She wanted clothes to keep her warm, and food to\r\n",
      "eat; but she had kept it safe, and had it in her bosom.  It was gold, I\r\n",
      "tell you!  Rich gold, that might have saved her life!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Gold!' echoed the matron, bending eagerly over the woman as she fell\r\n",
      "back.  'Go on, go on--yes--what of it?  Who was the mother? When was\r\n",
      "it?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She charged me to keep it safe,' replied the woman with a groan, 'and\r\n",
      "trusted me as the only woman about her.  I stole it in my heart when\r\n",
      "she first showed it me hanging round her neck; and the child's death,\r\n",
      "perhaps, is on me besides!  They would have treated him better, if they\r\n",
      "had known it all!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Known what?' asked the other.  'Speak!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "heeding the question, 'that I could never forget it when I saw his\r\n",
      "face.  Poor girl! poor girl!  She was so young, too! Such a gentle\r\n",
      "lamb!  Wait; there's more to tell.  I have not told you all, have I?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no,' replied the matron, inclining her head to catch the words, as\r\n",
      "they came more faintly from the dying woman.  'Be quick, or it may be\r\n",
      "too late!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The mother,' said the woman, making a more violent effort than before;\r\n",
      "'the mother, when the pains of death first came upon her, whispered in\r\n",
      "my ear that if her baby was born alive, and thrived, the day might come\r\n",
      "when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother\r\n",
      "named. \"And oh, kind Heaven!\" she said, folding her thin hands\r\n",
      "together, \"whether it be boy or girl, raise up some friends for it in\r\n",

      "abandoned to its mercy!\"'\r\n",

      "back, instinctively, as she once again rose, slowly and stiffly, into a\r\n",
      "sitting posture; then, clutching the coverlid with both hands, muttered\r\n",

      "While these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat\r\n",
      "in the old den--the same from which Oliver had been removed by the\r\n",
      "girl--brooding over a dull, smoky fire.  He held a pair of bellows upon\r\n",
      "his knee, with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it\r\n",

      "great additional interest from his close observance of the game, and\r\n",
      "his attentive perusal of Mr. Chitling's hand; upon which, from time to\r\n",
      "time, as occasion served, he bestowed a variety of earnest glances:\r\n",
      "wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon\r\n",
      "his neighbour's cards.  It being a cold night, the Dodger wore his hat,\r\n",
      "as, indeed, was often his custom within doors.  He also sustained a\r\n",
      "clay pipe between his teeth, which he only removed for a brief space\r\n",

      "he more frequently applied himself to the gin-and-water, and moreover\r\n",
      "indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming a\r\n",
      "scientific rubber.  Indeed, the Artful, presuming upon their close\r\n",
      "attachment, more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his\r\n",

      "other neatly-turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy application\r\n",

      "such a feller as you, Jack; you win everything.  Even when we've good\r\n",
      "cards, Charley and I can't make nothing of 'em.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Either the master or the manner of this remark, which was made very\r\n",
      "ruefully, delighted Charley Bates so much, that his consequent shout of\r\n",
      "laughter roused the Jew from his reverie, and induced him to inquire\r\n",
      "what was the matter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Matter, Fagin!' cried Charley.  'I wish you had watched the play.\r\n",
      "Tommy Chitling hasn't won a point; and I went partners with him against\r\n",
      "the Artfull and dumb.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ay, ay!' said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently demonstrated\r\n",
      "that he was at no loss to understand the reason. 'Try 'em again, Tom;\r\n",
      "try 'em again.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No more of it for me, thank 'ee, Fagin,' replied Mr. Chitling; 'I've\r\n",
      "had enough.  That 'ere Dodger has such a run of luck that there's no\r\n",
      "standing again' him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ha! ha! my dear,' replied the Jew, 'you must get up very early in the\r\n",
      "morning, to win against the Dodger.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Morning!' said Charley Bates; 'you must put your boots on over-night,\r\n",
      "and have a telescope at each eye, and a opera-glass between your\r\n",
      "shoulders, if you want to come over him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy,\r\n",
      "and offered to cut any gentleman in company, for the first\r\n",
      "picture-card, at a shilling at a time.  Nobody accepting the challenge,\r\n",
      "and his pipe being by this time smoked out, he proceeded to amuse\r\n",
      "himself by sketching a ground-plan of Newgate on the table with the\r\n",
      "piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters; whistling,\r\n",
      "meantime, with peculiar shrillness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'How precious dull you are, Tommy!' said the Dodger, stopping short\r\n",
      "when there had been a long silence; and addressing Mr. Chitling.  'What\r\n",
      "do you think he's thinking of, Fagin?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'How should I know, my dear?' replied the Jew, looking round as he\r\n",
      "plied the bellows.  'About his losses, maybe; or the little retirement\r\n",
      "in the country that he's just left, eh?  Ha! ha!  Is that it, my dear?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not a bit of it,' replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of\r\n",
      "discourse as Mr. Chitling was about to reply.  'What do _you_ say,\r\n",
      "Charley?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'_I_ should say,' replied Master Bates, with a grin, 'that he was\r\n",
      "uncommon sweet upon Betsy.  See how he's a-blushing!  Oh, my eye!\r\n",
      "here's a merry-go-rounder!  Tommy Chitling's in love!  Oh, Fagin,\r\n",
      "Fagin! what a spree!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim\r\n",
      "of the tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his chair\r\n",
      "with such violence, that he lost his balance, and pitched over upon the\r\n",
      "floor; where (the accident abating nothing of his merriment) he lay at\r\n",
      "full length until his laugh was over, when he resumed his former\r\n",
      "position, and began another laugh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Never mind him, my dear,' said the Jew, winking at Mr. Dawkins, and\r\n",
      "giving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows.\r\n",
      "'Betsy's a fine girl.  Stick up to her, Tom.  Stick up to her.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What I mean to say, Fagin,' replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the\r\n",
      "face, 'is, that that isn't anything to anybody here.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No more it is,' replied the Jew; 'Charley will talk.  Don't mind him,\r\n",
      "my dear; don't mind him.  Betsy's a fine girl.  Do as she bids you,\r\n",
      "Tom, and you will make your fortune.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So I _do_ do as she bids me,' replied Mr. Chitling; 'I shouldn't have\r\n",
      "been milled, if it hadn't been for her advice.  But it turned out a\r\n",
      "good job for you; didn't it, Fagin!  And what's six weeks of it?  It\r\n",
      "must come, some time or another, and why not in the winter time when\r\n",
      "you don't want to go out a-walking so much; eh, Fagin?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah, to be sure, my dear,' replied the Jew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You wouldn't mind it again, Tom, would you,' asked the Dodger, winking\r\n",
      "upon Charley and the Jew, 'if Bet was all right?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I mean to say that I shouldn't,' replied Tom, angrily. 'There, now.\r\n",
      "Ah!  Who'll say as much as that, I should like to know; eh, Fagin?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nobody, my dear,' replied the Jew; 'not a soul, Tom.  I don't know one\r\n",
      "of 'em that would do it besides you; not one of 'em, my dear.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I might have got clear off, if I'd split upon her; mightn't I, Fagin?'\r\n",
      "angrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe.  'A word from me would have\r\n",
      "done it; wouldn't it, Fagin?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'To be sure it would, my dear,' replied the Jew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'But I didn't blab it; did I, Fagin?' demanded Tom, pouring question\r\n",
      "upon question with great volubility.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no, to be sure,' replied the Jew; 'you were too stout-hearted for\r\n",
      "that.  A deal too stout, my dear!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Perhaps I was,' rejoined Tom, looking round; 'and if I was, what's to\r\n",
      "laugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused, hastened\r\n",
      "to assure him that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the\r\n",
      "company, appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender.  But,\r\n",
      "unfortunately, Charley, in opening his mouth to reply that he was never\r\n",
      "more serious in his life, was unable to prevent the escape of such a\r\n",
      "violent roar, that the abused Mr. Chitling, without any preliminary\r\n",
      "ceremonies, rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender;\r\n",
      "who, being skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose\r\n",
      "his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old\r\n",
      "gentleman, and caused him to stagger to the wall, where he stood\r\n",
      "panting for breath, while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hark!' cried the Dodger at this moment, 'I heard the tinkler.'\r\n",
      "Catching up the light, he crept softly upstairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party were in\r\n",
      "darkness.  After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered\r\n",
      "Fagin mysteriously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What!' cried the Jew, 'alone?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Dodger nodded in the affirmative, and, shading the flame of the\r\n",
      "candle with his hand, gave Charley Bates a private intimation, in dumb\r\n",
      "show, that he had better not be funny just then.  Having performed this\r\n",
      "friendly office, he fixed his eyes on the Jew's face, and awaited his\r\n",
      "directions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man bit his yellow fingers, and meditated for some seconds; his\r\n",
      "face working with agitation the while, as if he dreaded something, and\r\n",
      "feared to know the worst.  At length he raised his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Where is he?' he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a gesture, as if to\r\n",
      "leave the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,' said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; 'bring him down. Hush!\r\n",
      "Quiet, Charley!  Gently, Tom!  Scarce, scarce!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This brief direction to Charley Bates, and his recent antagonist, was\r\n",
      "softly and immediately obeyed.  There was no sound of their whereabout,\r\n",
      "when the Dodger descended the stairs, bearing the light in his hand,\r\n",
      "and followed by a man in a coarse smock-frock; who, after casting a\r\n",
      "hurried glance round the room, pulled off a large wrapper which had\r\n",
      "concealed the lower portion of his face, and disclosed: all haggard,\r\n",
      "unwashed, and unshorn: the features of flash Toby Crackit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'How are you, Faguey?' said this worthy, nodding to the Jew. 'Pop that\r\n",
      "shawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where to find it\r\n",
      "when I cut; that's the time of day!  You'll be a fine young cracksman\r\n",
      "afore the old file now.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words he pulled up the smock-frock; and, winding it round\r\n",
      "his middle, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his feet upon the hob.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'See there, Faguey,' he said, pointing disconsolately to his top boots;\r\n",
      "'not a drop of Day and Martin since you know when; not a bubble of\r\n",
      "blacking, by Jove!   But don't look at me in that way, man.  All in\r\n",
      "good time.  I can't talk about business till I've eat and drank; so\r\n",
      "produce the sustainance, and let's have a quiet fill-out for the first\r\n",
      "time these three days!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were, upon\r\n",
      "the table; and, seating himself opposite the housebreaker, waited his\r\n",
      "leisure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To judge from appearances, Toby was by no means in a hurry to open the\r\n",
      "conversation.  At first, the Jew contented himself with patiently\r\n",
      "watching his countenance, as if to gain from its expression some clue\r\n",
      "to the intelligence he brought; but in vain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked tired and worn, but there was the same complacent repose upon\r\n",
      "his features that they always wore:  and through dirt, and beard, and\r\n",
      "whisker, there still shone, unimpaired, the self-satisfied smirk of\r\n",
      "flash Toby Crackit. Then the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched\r\n",
      "every morsel he put into his mouth; pacing up and down the room,\r\n",
      "meanwhile, in irrepressible excitement.  It was all of no use.  Toby\r\n",
      "continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference, until he could\r\n",
      "eat no more; then, ordering the Dodger out, he closed the door, mixed a\r\n",
      "glass of spirits and water, and composed himself for talking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'First and foremost, Faguey,' said Toby.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, yes!' interposed the Jew, drawing up his chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water, and to\r\n",
      "declare that the gin was excellent; then placing his feet against the\r\n",
      "low mantelpiece, so as to bring his boots to about the level of his\r\n",
      "eye, he quietly resumed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'First and foremost, Faguey,' said the housebreaker, 'how's Bill?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What!' screamed the Jew, starting from his seat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, you don't mean to say--' began Toby, turning pale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mean!' cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground. 'Where are\r\n",
      "they?  Sikes and the boy!  Where are they?  Where have they been?\r\n",
      "Where are they hiding?  Why have they not been here?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The crack failed,' said Toby faintly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I know it,' replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his pocket and\r\n",
      "pointing to it.  'What more?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'They fired and hit the boy.  We cut over the fields at the back, with\r\n",
      "him between us--straight as the crow flies--through hedge and ditch.\r\n",
      "They gave chase.  Damme! the whole country was awake, and the dogs upon\r\n",
      "us.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The boy!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bill had him on his back, and scudded like the wind.  We stopped to\r\n",
      "take him between us; his head hung down, and he was cold. They were\r\n",
      "close upon our heels; every man for himself, and each from the gallows!\r\n",
      "We parted company, and left the youngster lying in a ditch.  Alive or\r\n",
      "dead, that's all I know about him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew stopped to hear no more; but uttering a loud yell, and twining\r\n",
      "his hands in his hair, rushed from the room, and from the house.\r\n",

      "THINGS, INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY, ARE DONE AND PERFORMED\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man had gained the street corner, before he began to recover\r\n",
      "the effect of Toby Crackit's intelligence.  He had relaxed nothing of\r\n",
      "his unusual speed; but was still pressing onward, in the same wild and\r\n",
      "disordered manner, when the sudden dashing past of a carriage: and a\r\n",
      "boisterous cry from the foot passengers, who saw his danger:  drove him\r\n",
      "back upon the pavement.  Avoiding, as much as was possible, all the\r\n",
      "main streets, and skulking only through the by-ways and alleys, he at\r\n",
      "length emerged on Snow Hill.  Here he walked even faster than before;\r\n",
      "nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court; when, as if\r\n",
      "conscious that he was now in his proper element, he fell into his usual\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Near to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet, opens, upon\r\n",
      "the right hand as you come out of the City, a narrow and dismal alley,\r\n",
      "leading to Saffron Hill.  In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge\r\n",
      "bunches of second-hand silk handkerchiefs, of all sizes and patterns;\r\n",
      "for here reside the traders who purchase them from pick-pockets.\r\n",
      "Hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the\r\n",
      "windows or flaunting from the door-posts; and the shelves, within, are\r\n",
      "piled with them. Confined as the limits of Field Lane are, it has its\r\n",
      "barber, its coffee-shop, its beer-shop, and its fried-fish warehouse.\r\n",
      "It is a commercial colony of itself:  the emporium of petty larceny:\r\n",
      "visited at early morning, and setting-in of dusk, by silent merchants,\r\n",
      "who traffic in dark back-parlours, and who go as strangely as they\r\n",
      "come.  Here, the clothesman, the shoe-vamper, and the rag-merchant,\r\n",
      "display their goods, as sign-boards to the petty thief; here, stores of\r\n",
      "old iron and bones, and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen-stuff and\r\n",
      "linen, rust and rot in the grimy cellars.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was into this place that the Jew turned.  He was well known to the\r\n",
      "sallow denizens of the lane; for such of them as were on the look-out\r\n",
      "to buy or sell, nodded, familiarly, as he passed along. He replied to\r\n",
      "their salutations in the same way; but bestowed no closer recognition\r\n",
      "until he reached the further end of the alley; when he stopped, to\r\n",
      "address a salesman of small stature, who had squeezed as much of his\r\n",
      "person into a child's chair as the chair would hold, and was smoking a\r\n",
      "pipe at his warehouse door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would cure the hoptalmy!' said this\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'Well, I've heerd that complaint of it, once or twice before,' replied\r\n",
      "the trader; 'but it soon cools down again; don't you find it so?'\r\n",

      "think your friend's there.'\r\n",

      "'Sikes is not, I suppose?' inquired the Jew, with a disappointed\r\n",
      "countenance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'_Non istwentus_, as the lawyers say,' replied the little man, shaking\r\n",
      "his head, and looking amazingly sly.  'Have you got anything in my line\r\n",
      "to-night?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "easily disengage himself from the chair; the sign of the Cripples was,\r\n",
      "for a time, bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively's presence.  By the\r\n",
      "time he had got upon his legs, the Jew had disappeared; so Mr. Lively,\r\n",
      "after ineffectually standing on tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight\r\n",
      "of him, again forced himself into the little chair, and, exchanging a\r\n",
      "shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and\r\n",
      "mistrust were plainly mingled, resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples; which was the sign by which\r\n",
      "the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons:  was the\r\n",
      "public-house in which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already figured.\r\n",
      "Merely making a sign to a man at the bar, Fagin walked straight\r\n",
      "upstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly insinuating\r\n",
      "himself into the chamber, looked anxiously about: shading his eyes with\r\n",
      "his hand, as if in search of some particular person.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The room was illuminated by two gas-lights; the glare of which was\r\n",
      "prevented by the barred shutters, and closely-drawn curtains of faded\r\n",
      "red, from being visible outside.  The ceiling was blackened, to prevent\r\n",
      "its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps; and the\r\n",
      "place was so full of dense tobacco smoke, that at first it was scarcely\r\n",
      "possible to discern anything more.  By degrees, however, as some of it\r\n",
      "cleared away through the open door, an assemblage of heads, as confused\r\n",
      "as the noises that greeted the ear, might be made out; and as the eye\r\n",
      "grew more accustomed to the scene, the spectator gradually became aware\r\n",
      "of the presence of a numerous company, male and female, crowded round a\r\n",
      "long table: at the upper end of which, sat a chairman with a hammer of\r\n",
      "office in his hand; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose,\r\n",
      "and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache, presided at a\r\n",
      "jingling piano in a remote corner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running over\r\n",
      "the keys by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a\r\n",
      "song; which having subsided, a young lady proceeded to entertain the\r\n",
      "company with a ballad in four verses, between each of which the\r\n",
      "accompanyist played the melody all through, as loud as he could.  When\r\n",
      "this was over, the chairman gave a sentiment, after which, the\r\n",
      "professional gentleman on the chairman's right and left volunteered a\r\n",
      "duet, and sang it, with great applause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from\r\n",
      "among the group.  There was the chairman himself, (the landlord of the\r\n",
      "house,) a coarse, rough, heavy built fellow, who, while the songs were\r\n",
      "proceeding, rolled his eyes hither and thither, and, seeming to give\r\n",
      "himself up to joviality, had an eye for everything that was done, and\r\n",
      "an ear for everything that was said--and sharp ones, too.  Near him\r\n",
      "were the singers: receiving, with professional indifference, the\r\n",
      "compliments of the company, and applying themselves, in turn, to a\r\n",
      "dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water, tendered by their more\r\n",
      "boisterous admirers; whose countenances, expressive of almost every\r\n",
      "vice in almost every grade, irresistibly attracted the attention, by\r\n",
      "their very repulsiveness.  Cunning, ferocity, and drunkeness in all its\r\n",
      "stages, were there, in their strongest aspect; and women: some with the\r\n",
      "last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you\r\n",
      "looked:  others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten\r\n",
      "out, and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime;\r\n",
      "some mere girls, others but young women, and none past the prime of\r\n",
      "life; formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked eagerly from face to face\r\n",
      "while these proceedings were in progress; but apparently without\r\n",
      "meeting that of which he was in search. Succeeding, at length, in\r\n",
      "catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair, he beckoned to him\r\n",
      "slightly, and left the room, as quietly as he had entered it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?' inquired the man, as he followed\r\n",
      "him out to the landing.  'Won't you join us?  They'll be delighted,\r\n",
      "every one of 'em.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew shook his head impatiently, and said in a whisper, 'Is _he_\r\n",
      "here?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' replied the man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And no news of Barney?' inquired Fagin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'None,' replied the landlord of the Cripples; for it was he. 'He won't\r\n",
      "stir till it's all safe.  Depend on it, they're on the scent down\r\n",
      "there; and that if he moved, he'd blow upon the thing at once.  He's\r\n",
      "all right enough, Barney is, else I should have heard of him.  I'll\r\n",
      "pound it, that Barney's managing properly. Let him alone for that.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Will _he_ be here to-night?' asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis\r\n",
      "on the pronoun as before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Monks, do you mean?' inquired the landlord, hesitating.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hush!' said the Jew.  'Yes.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Certain,' replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his fob; 'I\r\n",
      "expected him here before now.  If you'll wait ten minutes, he'll be--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no,' said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he might\r\n",
      "be to see the person in question, he was nevertheless relieved by his\r\n",
      "absence.  'Tell him I came here to see him; and that he must come to me\r\n",
      "to-night.  No, say to-morrow.  As he is not here, to-morrow will be\r\n",
      "time enough.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Good!' said the man.  'Nothing more?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not a word now,' said the Jew, descending the stairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I say,' said the other, looking over the rails, and speaking in a\r\n",
      "hoarse whisper; 'what a time this would be for a sell!  I've got Phil\r\n",
      "Barker here: so drunk, that a boy might take him!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah!  But it's not Phil Barker's time,' said the Jew, looking up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Phil has something more to do, before we can afford to part with him;\r\n",
      "so go back to the company, my dear, and tell them to lead merry\r\n",
      "lives--_while they last_.  Ha! ha! ha!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The landlord reciprocated the old man's laugh; and returned to his\r\n",
      "guests.  The Jew was no sooner alone, than his countenance resumed its\r\n",
      "former expression of anxiety and thought.  After a brief reflection, he\r\n",
      "called a hack-cabriolet, and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green.\r\n",
      "He dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes's\r\n",
      "residence, and performed the short remainder of the distance, on foot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now,' muttered the Jew, as he knocked at the door, 'if there is any\r\n",
      "deep play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you\r\n",
      "are.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was in her room, the woman said.  Fagin crept softly upstairs, and\r\n",
      "entered it without any previous ceremony.  The girl was alone; lying\r\n",
      "with her head upon the table, and her hair straggling over it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She has been drinking,' thought the Jew, cooly, 'or perhaps she is\r\n",
      "only miserable.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man turned to close the door, as he made this reflection; the\r\n",
      "noise thus occasioned, roused the girl.  She eyed his crafty face\r\n",
      "narrowly, as she inquired to his recital of Toby Crackit's story.  When\r\n",
      "it was concluded, she sank into her former attitude, but spoke not a\r\n",
      "word.  She pushed the candle impatiently away; and once or twice as she\r\n",
      "feverishly changed her position, shuffled her feet upon the ground; but\r\n",
      "this was all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to\r\n",
      "assure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly\r\n",
      "returned.  Apparently satisfied with his inspection, he coughed twice\r\n",
      "or thrice, and made as many efforts to open a conversation; but the\r\n",
      "girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone.  At length\r\n",
      "he made another attempt; and rubbing his hands together, said, in his\r\n",
      "most conciliatory tone,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And where should you think Bill was now, my dear?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl moaned out some half intelligible reply, that she could not\r\n",
      "tell; and seemed, from the smothered noise that escaped her, to be\r\n",
      "crying.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And the boy, too,' said the Jew, straining his eyes to catch a glimpse\r\n",
      "of her face.  'Poor leetle child!  Left in a ditch, Nance; only think!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The child,' said the girl, suddenly looking up, 'is better where he\r\n",
      "is, than among us; and if no harm comes to Bill from it, I hope he lies\r\n",
      "dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What!' cried the Jew, in amazement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ay, I do,' returned the girl, meeting his gaze.  'I shall be glad to\r\n",
      "have him away from my eyes, and to know that the worst is over.  I\r\n",
      "can't bear to have him about me.  The sight of him turns me against\r\n",
      "myself, and all of you.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Pooh!' said the Jew, scornfully.  'You're drunk.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Am I?' cried the girl bitterly.  'It's no fault of yours, if I am not!\r\n",
      "You'd never have me anything else, if you had your will, except\r\n",
      "now;--the humour doesn't suit you, doesn't it?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No!' rejoined the Jew, furiously.  'It does not.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Change it, then!' responded the girl, with a laugh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Change it!' exclaimed the Jew, exasperated beyond all bounds by his\r\n",
      "companion's unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the night, 'I\r\n",
      "_will_ change it!  Listen to me, you drab.  Listen to me, who with six\r\n",
      "words, can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his bull's throat\r\n",
      "between my fingers now.  If he comes back, and leaves the boy behind\r\n",
      "him; if he gets off free, and dead or alive, fails to restore him to\r\n",
      "me; murder him yourself if you would have him escape Jack Ketch.  And\r\n",
      "do it the moment he sets foot in this room, or mind me, it will be too\r\n",
      "late!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What is all this?' cried the girl involuntarily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What is it?' pursued Fagin, mad with rage.  'When the boy's worth\r\n",
      "hundreds of pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw me in the way\r\n",
      "of getting safely, through the whims of a drunken gang that I could\r\n",
      "whistle away the lives of!  And me bound, too, to a born devil that\r\n",
      "only wants the will, and has the power to, to--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Panting for breath, the old man stammered for a word; and in that\r\n",
      "instant checked the torrent of his wrath, and changed his whole\r\n",
      "demeanour.  A moment before, his clenched hands had grasped the air;\r\n",
      "his eyes had dilated; and his face grown livid with passion; but now,\r\n",
      "he shrunk into a chair, and, cowering together, trembled with the\r\n",
      "apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy.  After a\r\n",
      "short silence, he ventured to look round at his companion.  He appeared\r\n",
      "somewhat reassured, on beholding her in the same listless attitude from\r\n",
      "which he had first roused her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nancy, dear!' croaked the Jew, in his usual voice.  'Did you mind me,\r\n",
      "dear?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Don't worry me now, Fagin!' replied the girl, raising her head\r\n",
      "languidly.  'If Bill has not done it this time, he will another. He has\r\n",
      "done many a good job for you, and will do many more when he can; and\r\n",
      "when he can't he won't; so no more about that.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Regarding this boy, my dear?' said the Jew, rubbing the palms of his\r\n",
      "hands nervously together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The boy must take his chance with the rest,' interrupted Nancy,\r\n",
      "hastily; 'and I say again, I hope he is dead, and out of harm's way,\r\n",
      "and out of yours,--that is, if Bill comes to no harm.  And if Toby got\r\n",
      "clear off, Bill's pretty sure to be safe; for Bill's worth two of Toby\r\n",
      "any time.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And about what I was saying, my dear?' observed the Jew, keeping his\r\n",
      "glistening eye steadily upon her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You must say it all over again, if it's anything you want me to do,'\r\n",
      "rejoined Nancy; 'and if it is, you had better wait till to-morrow.  You\r\n",
      "put me up for a minute; but now I'm stupid again.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fagin put several other questions: all with the same drift of\r\n",
      "ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints; but,\r\n",
      "she answered them so readily, and was withal so utterly unmoved by his\r\n",
      "searching looks, that his original impression of her being more than a\r\n",
      "trifle in liquor, was confirmed.  Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a\r\n",
      "failing which was very common among the Jew's female pupils; and in\r\n",
      "which, in their tenderer years, they were rather encouraged than\r\n",
      "checked. Her disordered appearance, and a wholesale perfume of Geneva\r\n",
      "which pervaded the apartment, afforded strong confirmatory evidence of\r\n",
      "the justice of the Jew's supposition; and when, after indulging in the\r\n",
      "temporary display of violence above described, she subsided, first into\r\n",
      "dullness, and afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the\r\n",
      "influence of which she shed tears one minute, and in the next gave\r\n",
      "utterance to various exclamations of 'Never say die!' and divers\r\n",
      "calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a\r\n",
      "lady or gentleman was happy, Mr. Fagin, who had had considerable\r\n",
      "experience of such matters in his time, saw, with great satisfaction,\r\n",
      "that she was very far gone indeed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having eased his mind by this discovery; and having accomplished his\r\n",
      "twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had, that night, heard,\r\n",
      "and of ascertaining, with his own eyes, that Sikes had not returned,\r\n",
      "Mr. Fagin again turned his face homeward: leaving his young friend\r\n",
      "asleep, with her head upon the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was within an hour of midnight.  The weather being dark, and\r\n",
      "piercing cold, he had no great temptation to loiter.  The sharp wind\r\n",
      "that scoured the streets, seemed to have cleared them of passengers, as\r\n",
      "of dust and mud, for few people were abroad, and they were to all\r\n",
      "appearance hastening fast home. It blew from the right quarter for the\r\n",
      "Jew, however, and straight before it he went: trembling, and shivering,\r\n",
      "as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had reached the corner of his own street, and was already fumbling\r\n",
      "in his pocket for the door-key, when a dark figure emerged from a\r\n",
      "projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow, and, crossing the road,\r\n",
      "glided up to him unperceived.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Fagin!' whispered a voice close to his ear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah!' said the Jew, turning quickly round, 'is that--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes!' interrupted the stranger.  'I have been lingering here these two\r\n",
      "hours.  Where the devil have you been?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'On your business, my dear,' replied the Jew, glancing uneasily at his\r\n",
      "companion, and slackening his pace as he spoke.  'On your business all\r\n",
      "night.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, of course!' said the stranger, with a sneer.  'Well; and what's\r\n",
      "come of it?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing good,' said the Jew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing bad, I hope?' said the stranger, stopping short, and turning a\r\n",
      "startled look on his companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew shook his head, and was about to reply, when the stranger,\r\n",
      "interrupting him, motioned to the house, before which they had by this\r\n",
      "time arrived:  remarking, that he had better say what he had got to\r\n",
      "say, under cover:  for his blood was chilled with standing about so\r\n",
      "long, and the wind blew through him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking\r\n",
      "home a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed, muttered\r\n",
      "something about having no fire; but his companion repeating his request\r\n",
      "in a peremptory manner, he unlocked the door, and requested him to\r\n",
      "close it softly, while he got a light.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's as dark as the grave,' said the man, groping forward a few steps.\r\n",
      "'Make haste!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Shut the door,' whispered Fagin from the end of the passage. As he\r\n",
      "spoke, it closed with a loud noise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That wasn't my doing,' said the other man, feeling his way. 'The wind\r\n",
      "blew it to, or it shut of its own accord: one or the other. Look sharp\r\n",
      "with the light, or I shall knock my brains out against something in\r\n",
      "this confounded hole.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs.  After a short absence,\r\n",
      "he returned with a lighted candle, and the intelligence that Toby\r\n",
      "Crackit was asleep in the back room below, and that the boys were in\r\n",
      "the front one.  Beckoning the man to follow him, he led the way\r\n",
      "upstairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We can say the few words we've got to say in here, my dear,' said the\r\n",
      "Jew, throwing open a door on the first floor; 'and as there are holes\r\n",
      "in the shutters, and we never show lights to our neighbours, we'll set\r\n",
      "the candle on the stairs.  There!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an upper\r\n",
      "flight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door.  This done, he led\r\n",
      "the way into the apartment; which was destitute of all movables save a\r\n",
      "broken arm-chair, and an old couch or sofa without covering, which\r\n",
      "stood behind the door.  Upon this piece of furniture, the stranger sat\r\n",
      "himself with the air of a weary man; and the Jew, drawing up the\r\n",
      "arm-chair opposite, they sat face to face.  It was not quite dark; the\r\n",
      "door was partially open; and the candle outside, threw a feeble\r\n",
      "reflection on the opposite wall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They conversed for some time in whispers.  Though nothing of the\r\n",
      "conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and\r\n",
      "there, a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be\r\n",
      "defending himself against some remarks of the stranger; and that the\r\n",
      "latter was in a state of considerable irritation.  They might have been\r\n",
      "talking, thus, for a quarter of an hour or more, when Monks--by which\r\n",
      "name the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course\r\n",
      "of their colloquy--said, raising his voice a little,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I tell you again, it was badly planned.  Why not have kept him here\r\n",
      "among the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him at\r\n",
      "once?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Only hear him!' exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, do you mean to say you couldn't have done it, if you had chosen?'\r\n",
      "demanded Monks, sternly.  'Haven't you done it, with other boys, scores\r\n",
      "of times?  If you had had patience for a twelvemonth, at most, couldn't\r\n",
      "you have got him convicted, and sent safely out of the kingdom; perhaps\r\n",
      "for life?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Whose turn would that have served, my dear?' inquired the Jew humbly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mine,' replied Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'But not mine,' said the Jew, submissively.  'He might have become of\r\n",
      "use to me.  When there are two parties to a bargain, it is only\r\n",
      "reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted; is it, my\r\n",
      "good friend?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What then?' demanded Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I saw it was not easy to train him to the business,' replied the Jew;\r\n",
      "'he was not like other boys in the same circumstances.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Curse him, no!' muttered the man, 'or he would have been a thief, long\r\n",
      "ago.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I had no hold upon him to make him worse,' pursued the Jew, anxiously\r\n",
      "watching the countenance of his companion.  'His hand was not in.  I\r\n",
      "had nothing to frighten him with; which we always must have in the\r\n",
      "beginning, or we labour in vain.  What could I do?  Send him out with\r\n",
      "the Dodger and Charley?  We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I\r\n",
      "trembled for us all.'\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'No, no, my dear!' renewed the Jew.  'And I don't quarrel with it now;\r\n",
      "because, if it had never happened, you might never have clapped eyes on\r\n",
      "the boy to notice him, and so led to the discovery that it was him you\r\n",
      "were looking for.  Well!  I got him back for you by means of the girl;\r\n",
      "and then _she_ begins to favour him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Throttle the girl!' said Monks, impatiently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, we can't afford to do that just now, my dear,' replied the Jew,\r\n",
      "smiling; 'and, besides, that sort of thing is not in our way; or, one\r\n",
      "of these days, I might be glad to have it done.  I know what these\r\n",
      "girls are, Monks, well.  As soon as the boy begins to harden, she'll\r\n",
      "care no more for him, than for a block of wood.  You want him made a\r\n",
      "thief.  If he is alive, I can make him one from this time; and,\r\n",

      "mind,--but if the worst comes to the worst, and he is dead--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's no fault of mine if he is!' interposed the other man, with a look\r\n",
      "of terror, and clasping the Jew's arm with trembling hands.  'Mind\r\n",
      "that.  Fagin!  I had no hand in it.  Anything but his death, I told you\r\n",
      "from the first.  I won't shed blood; it's always found out, and haunts\r\n",
      "a man besides.  If they shot him dead, I was not the cause; do you hear\r\n",
      "me?  Fire this infernal den!  What's that?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What!' cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with both\r\n",
      "arms, as he sprung to his feet.  'Where?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yonder! replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall.  'The shadow!\r\n",
      "I saw the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass along the\r\n",
      "wainscot like a breath!'\r\n",

      "The Jew released his hold, and they rushed tumultuously from the room.\r\n",
      "The candle, wasted by the draught, was standing where it had been\r\n",
      "placed.  It showed them only the empty staircase, and their own white\r\n",
      "faces.  They listened intently:  a profound silence reigned throughout\r\n",
      "the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's your fancy,' said the Jew, taking up the light and turning to his\r\n",
      "companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'll swear I saw it!' replied Monks, trembling.  'It was bending\r\n",
      "forward when I saw it first; and when I spoke, it darted away.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate, and,\r\n",
      "telling him he could follow, if he pleased, ascended the stairs.  They\r\n",
      "looked into all the rooms; they were cold, bare, and empty.  They\r\n",
      "descended into the passage, and thence into the cellars below.  The\r\n",
      "green damp hung upon the low walls; the tracks of the snail and slug\r\n",
      "glistened in the light of the candle; but all was still as death.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What do you think now?' said the Jew, when they had regained the\r\n",
      "passage.  'Besides ourselves, there's not a creature in the house\r\n",
      "except Toby and the boys; and they're safe enough. See here!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two keys from his pocket;\r\n",
      "and explained, that when he first went downstairs, he had locked them\r\n",
      "in, to prevent any intrusion on the conference.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks. His\r\n",
      "protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they\r\n",
      "proceeded in their search without making any discovery; and, now, he\r\n",
      "gave vent to several very grim laughs, and confessed it could only have\r\n",
      "been his excited imagination.  He declined any renewal of the\r\n",
      "conversation, however, for that night:  suddenly remembering that it\r\n",
      "was past one o'clock.  And so the amiable couple parted.\r\n",

      "carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with\r\n",

      "chair by the fireside, and covering her eyes with one hand, placed the\r\n",
      "other over her heart, and gasped for breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mrs. Corney,' said Mr. Bumble, stooping over the matron, 'what is\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'I can't help it,' whimpered the lady.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then take something, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble soothingly.  'A little of\r\n",
      "the wine?'\r\n",

      "lady pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion\r\n",
      "from internal spasms.  Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching\r\n",
      "a pint green-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated,\r\n",
      "filled a tea-cup with its contents, and held it to the lady's lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'm better now,' said Mrs. Corney, falling back, after drinking half\r\n",
      "of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and,\r\n",
      "bringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his nose.\r\n",

      "'Peppermint,' exclaimed Mrs. Corney, in a faint voice, smiling gently\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "'It's very comforting,' said Mrs. Corney.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Very much so indeed, ma'am,' said the beadle.  As he spoke, he drew a\r\n",
      "chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to\r\n",
      "distress her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing,' replied Mrs. Corney.  'I am a foolish, excitable, weak\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'Not weak, ma'am,' retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his chair a little\r\n",
      "closer.  'Are you a weak creetur, Mrs. Corney?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We are all weak creeturs,' said Mrs. Corney, laying down a general\r\n",
      "principle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So we are,' said the beadle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards. By the\r\n",
      "expiration of that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by\r\n",
      "removing his left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney's chair, where it\r\n",
      "had previously rested, to Mrs. Corney's apron-string, round which it\r\n",
      "gradually became entwined.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We are all weak creeturs,' said Mr. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Corney sighed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Don't sigh, Mrs. Corney,' said Mr. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I can't help it,' said Mrs. Corney.  And she sighed again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This is a very comfortable room, ma'am,' said Mr. Bumble looking\r\n",
      "round.  'Another room, and this, ma'am, would be a complete thing.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It would be too much for one,' murmured the lady.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'But not for two, ma'am,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, in soft accents. 'Eh,\r\n",
      "Mrs. Corney?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Corney drooped her head, when the beadle said this; the beadle\r\n",
      "drooped his, to get a view of Mrs. Corney's face.  Mrs. Corney, with\r\n",
      "great propriety, turned her head away, and released her hand to get at\r\n",
      "her pocket-handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The board allows you coals, don't they, Mrs. Corney?' inquired the\r\n",
      "beadle, affectionately pressing her hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And candles,' replied Mrs. Corney, slightly returning the pressure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Coals, candles, and house-rent free,' said Mr. Bumble.  'Oh, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Corney, what an Angel you are!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lady was not proof against this burst of feeling.  She sank into\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble's arms; and that gentleman in his agitation, imprinted a\r\n",
      "passionate kiss upon her chaste nose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Such porochial perfection!' exclaimed Mr. Bumble, rapturously. 'You\r\n",
      "know that Mr. Slout is worse to-night, my fascinator?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,' replied Mrs. Corney, bashfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He can't live a week, the doctor says,' pursued Mr. Bumble. 'He is the\r\n",
      "master of this establishment; his death will cause a wacancy; that\r\n",
      "wacancy must be filled up.  Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a prospect this\r\n",
      "opens!  What a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Corney sobbed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The little word?' said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful beauty.\r\n",
      "'The one little, little, little word, my blessed Corney?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ye--ye--yes!' sighed out the matron.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'One more,' pursued the beadle; 'compose your darling feelings for only\r\n",
      "one more.  When is it to come off?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Corney twice essayed to speak:  and twice failed.  At length\r\n",
      "summoning up courage, she threw her arms around Mr. Bumble's neck, and\r\n",
      "said, it might be as soon as ever he pleased, and that he was 'a\r\n",
      "irresistible duck.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged, the contract\r\n",
      "was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture;\r\n",
      "which was rendered the more necessary, by the flutter and agitation of\r\n",
      "the lady's spirits.  While it was being disposed of, she acquainted Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble with the old woman's decease.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Very good,' said that gentleman, sipping his peppermint; 'I'll call at\r\n",
      "Sowerberry's as I go home, and tell him to send to-morrow morning.  Was\r\n",
      "it that as frightened you, love?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It wasn't anything particular, dear,' said the lady evasively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It must have been something, love,' urged Mr. Bumble. 'Won't you tell\r\n",
      "your own B.?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not now,' rejoined the lady; 'one of these days.  After we're married,\r\n",
      "dear.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'After we're married!' exclaimed Mr. Bumble.  'It wasn't any impudence\r\n",
      "from any of them male paupers as--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no, love!' interposed the lady, hastily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If I thought it was,' continued Mr. Bumble; 'if I thought as any one\r\n",
      "of 'em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'They wouldn't have dared to do it, love,' responded the lady.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'They had better not!' said Mr. Bumble, clenching his fist. 'Let me see\r\n",
      "any man, porochial or extra-porochial, as would presume to do it; and I\r\n",
      "can tell him that he wouldn't do it a second time!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed\r\n",
      "no very high compliment to the lady's charms; but, as Mr. Bumble\r\n",
      "accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures, she was much touched\r\n",
      "with this proof of his devotion, and protested, with great admiration,\r\n",
      "that he was indeed a dove.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dove then turned up his coat-collar, and put on his cocked hat;\r\n",
      "and, having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future\r\n",
      "partner, once again braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing,\r\n",
      "for a few minutes, in the male paupers' ward, to abuse them a little,\r\n",
      "with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of\r\n",
      "workhouse-master with needful acerbity. Assured of his qualifications,\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of\r\n",
      "his future promotion:  which served to occupy his mind until he reached\r\n",
      "the shop of the undertaker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper: and\r\n",
      "Noah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a\r\n",
      "greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient\r\n",
      "performance of the two functions of eating and drinking, the shop was\r\n",
      "not closed, although it was past the usual hour of shutting-up.  Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times; but,\r\n",
      "attracting no attention, and beholding a light shining through the\r\n",
      "glass-window of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he made\r\n",
      "bold to peep in and see what was going forward; and when he saw what\r\n",
      "was going forward, he was not a little surprised.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread and\r\n",
      "butter, plates and glasses; a porter-pot and a wine-bottle. At the\r\n",
      "upper end of the table, Mr. Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an\r\n",
      "easy-chair, with his legs thrown over one of the arms: an open\r\n",
      "clasp-knife in one hand, and a mass of buttered bread in the other.\r\n",
      "Close beside him stood Charlotte, opening oysters from a barrel: which\r\n",
      "Mr. Claypole condescended to swallow, with remarkable avidity.  A more\r\n",
      "than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman's nose, and\r\n",
      "a kind of fixed wink in his right eye, denoted that he was in a slight\r\n",
      "degree intoxicated; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish\r\n",
      "with which he took his oysters, for which nothing but a strong\r\n",
      "appreciation of their cooling properties, in cases of internal fever,\r\n",
      "could have sufficiently accounted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Here's a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!' said Charlotte; 'try him, do;\r\n",
      "only this one.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What a delicious thing is a oyster!' remarked Mr. Claypole, after he\r\n",
      "had swallowed it.  'What a pity it is, a number of 'em should ever make\r\n",
      "you feel uncomfortable; isn't it, Charlotte?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's quite a cruelty,' said Charlotte.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So it is,' acquiesced Mr. Claypole. 'An't yer fond of oysters?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not overmuch,' replied Charlotte.  'I like to see you eat 'em, Noah\r\n",
      "dear, better than eating 'em myself.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Lor!' said Noah, reflectively; 'how queer!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Have another,' said Charlotte.  'Here's one with such a beautiful,\r\n",
      "delicate beard!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I can't manage any more,' said Noah.  'I'm very sorry.  Come here,\r\n",
      "Charlotte, and I'll kiss yer.'\r\n",

      "'What!' said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room.  'Say that again, sir.'\r\n",

      "Charlotte uttered a scream, and hid her face in her apron.  Mr.\r\n",
      "Claypole, without making any further change in his position than\r\n",
      "suffering his legs to reach the ground, gazed at the beadle in drunken\r\n",
      "terror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Say it again, you wile, owdacious fellow!' said Mr. Bumble. 'How dare\r\n",
      "you mention such a thing, sir?  And how dare you encourage him, you\r\n",
      "insolent minx?  Kiss her!' exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong indignation.\r\n",
      "'Faugh!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I didn't mean to do it!' said Noah, blubbering.  'She's always\r\n",
      "a-kissing of me, whether I like it, or not.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, Noah,' cried Charlotte, reproachfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yer are; yer know yer are!' retorted Noah.  'She's always a-doin' of\r\n",
      "it, Mr. Bumble, sir; she chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and\r\n",
      "makes all manner of love!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Silence!' cried Mr. Bumble, sternly.  'Take yourself downstairs,\r\n",
      "ma'am.  Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master\r\n",
      "comes home, at your peril; and, when he does come home, tell him that\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble said he was to send a old woman's shell after breakfast\r\n",
      "to-morrow morning.  Do you hear sir?  Kissing!' cried Mr. Bumble,\r\n",
      "holding up his hands.  'The sin and wickedness of the lower orders in\r\n",
      "this porochial district is frightful!  If Parliament don't take their\r\n",
      "abominable courses under consideration, this country's ruined, and the\r\n",
      "character of the peasantry gone for ever!'  With these words, the\r\n",

      "drawing a pistol from his pocket.  'Don't play booty with me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment the noise grew louder.  Sikes, again looking round,\r\n",

      "of being shot by his friend, to the certainty of being taken by his\r\n",

      "clenched his teeth; took one look around; threw over the prostrate form\r\n",
      "of Oliver, the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled; ran along\r\n",
      "the front of the hedge, as if to distract the attention of those\r\n",
      "behind, from the spot where the boy lay; paused, for a second, before\r\n",
      "another hedge which met it at right angles; and whirling his pistol\r\n",
      "high into the air, cleared it at a bound, and was gone.\r\n",

      "The dogs, who, in common with their masters, seemed to have no\r\n",
      "particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged, readily\r\n",
      "answered to the command.  Three men, who had by this time advanced some\r\n",

      "'My advice, or, leastways, I should say, my _orders_, is,' said the\r\n",

      "'Certainly,' replied the shorter man; 'and whatever Mr. Giles says, it\r\n",
      "isn't our place to contradict him.  No, no, I know my sitiwation!\r\n",
      "Thank my stars, I know my sitiwation.'  To tell the truth, the little\r\n",
      "man _did_ seem to know his situation, and to know perfectly well that\r\n",

      "party.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "under such circumstances.  I am.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So am I,' said Brittles; 'only there's no call to tell a man he is, so\r\n",
      "bounceably.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These frank admissions softened Mr. Giles, who at once owned that _he_\r\n",
      "was afraid; upon which, they all three faced about, and ran back again\r\n",
      "with the completest unanimity, until Mr. Giles (who had the shortest\r\n",
      "wind of the party, as was encumbered with a pitchfork) most handsomely\r\n",
      "insisted on stopping, to make an apology for his hastiness of speech.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'But it's wonderful,' said Mr. Giles, when he had explained, 'what a\r\n",
      "man will do, when his blood is up.  I should have committed murder--I\r\n",
      "know I should--if we'd caught one of them rascals.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as\r\n",
      "their blood, like his, had all gone down again; some speculation ensued\r\n",
      "upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I know what it was,' said Mr. Giles; 'it was the gate.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I shouldn't wonder if it was,' exclaimed Brittles, catching at the\r\n",
      "idea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You may depend upon it,' said Giles, 'that that gate stopped the flow\r\n",
      "of the excitement.  I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was\r\n",
      "climbing over it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with the\r\n",
      "same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment.  It was quite\r\n",
      "obvious, therefore, that it was the gate; especially as there was no\r\n",
      "doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place, because\r\n",
      "all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the\r\n",
      "instant of its occurance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the\r\n",
      "burglars, and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse,\r\n",
      "and who had been roused, together with his two mongrel curs, to join in\r\n",
      "the pursuit.  Mr. Giles acted in the double capacity of butler and\r\n",
      "steward to the old lady of the mansion; Brittles was a lad of all-work:\r\n",
      "who, having entered her service a mere child, was treated as a\r\n",
      "promising young boy still, though he was something past thirty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Encouraging each other with such converse as this; but, keeping very\r\n",
      "close together, notwithstanding, and looking apprehensively round,\r\n",
      "whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs; the three men hurried\r\n",
      "back to a tree, behind which they had left their lantern, lest its\r\n",
      "light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire.  Catching up\r\n",
      "the light, they made the best of their way home, at a good round trot;\r\n",
      "and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible, the\r\n",
      "light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance, like\r\n",
      "some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was\r\n",
      "swiftly borne.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The air grew colder, as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled along\r\n",
      "the ground like a dense cloud of smoke.  The grass was wet; the\r\n",
      "pathways, and low places, were all mire and water; the damp breath of\r\n",
      "an unwholesome wind went languidly by, with a hollow moaning.  Still,\r\n",
      "Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Morning drew on apace.  The air become more sharp and piercing, as its\r\n",
      "first dull hue--the death of night, rather than the birth of\r\n",
      "day--glimmered faintly in the sky.  The objects which had looked dim\r\n",
      "and terrible in the darkness, grew more and more defined, and gradually\r\n",
      "resolved into their familiar shapes.  The rain came down, thick and\r\n",
      "fast, and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes.  But, Oliver felt\r\n",
      "it not, as it beat against him; for he still lay stretched, helpless\r\n",
      "and unconscious, on his bed of clay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and\r\n",
      "uttering it, the boy awoke.  His left arm, rudely bandaged in a shawl,\r\n",
      "hung heavy and useless at his side; the bandage was saturated with\r\n",
      "blood.  He was so weak, that he could scarcely raise himself into a\r\n",
      "sitting posture; when he had done so, he looked feebly round for help,\r\n",
      "and groaned with pain.  Trembling in every joint, from cold and\r\n",
      "exhaustion, he made an effort to stand upright; but, shuddering from\r\n",
      "head to foot, fell prostrate on the ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long\r\n",
      "plunged, Oliver:  urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which\r\n",
      "seemed to warn him that if he lay there, he must surely die:  got upon\r\n",
      "his feet, and essayed to walk. His head was dizzy, and he staggered to\r\n",
      "and fro like a drunken man.  But he kept up, nevertheless, and, with\r\n",
      "his head drooping languidly on his breast, went stumbling onward, he\r\n",
      "knew not whither.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his\r\n",
      "mind.  He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who\r\n",
      "were angrily disputing--for the very words they said, sounded in his\r\n",
      "ears; and when he caught his own attention, as it were, by making some\r\n",
      "violent effort to save himself from falling, he found that he was\r\n",
      "talking to them. Then, he was alone with Sikes, plodding on as on the\r\n",
      "previous day; and as shadowy people passed them, he felt the robber's\r\n",
      "grasp upon his wrist. Suddenly, he started back at the report of\r\n",
      "firearms; there rose into the air, loud cries and shouts; lights\r\n",
      "gleamed before his eyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand\r\n",
      "bore him hurriedly away.  Through all these rapid visions, there ran an\r\n",
      "undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented\r\n",
      "him incessantly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus he staggered on, creeping, almost mechanically, between the bars\r\n",
      "of gates, or through hedge-gaps as they came in his way, until he\r\n",
      "reached a road.  Here the rain began to fall so heavily, that it roused\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house,\r\n",
      "which perhaps he could reach.  Pitying his condition, they might have\r\n",
      "compassion on him; and if they did not, it would be better, he thought,\r\n",
      "to die near human beings, than in the lonely open fields.  He summoned\r\n",
      "up all his strength for one last trial, and bent his faltering steps\r\n",
      "towards it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him that he had\r\n",
      "seen it before.  He remembered nothing of its details; but the shape\r\n",
      "and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That garden wall!  On the grass inside, he had fallen on his knees last\r\n",
      "night, and prayed the two men's mercy.  It was the very house they had\r\n",
      "attempted to rob.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place, that,\r\n",
      "for the instant, he forgot the agony of his wound, and thought only of\r\n",
      "flight.  Flight!  He could scarcely stand:  and if he were in full\r\n",
      "possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame,\r\n",
      "whither could he fly?  He pushed against the garden-gate; it was\r\n",
      "unlocked, and swung open on its hinges.  He tottered across the lawn;\r\n",
      "climbed the steps; knocked faintly at the door; and, his whole strength\r\n",
      "failing him, sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the tinker,\r\n",
      "were recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the\r\n",
      "night, with tea and sundries, in the kitchen.  Not that it was Mr.\r\n",
      "Giles's habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants:\r\n",
      "towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty\r\n",
      "affability, which, while it gratified, could not fail to remind them of\r\n",
      "his superior position in society.  But, death, fires, and burglary,\r\n",
      "make all men equals; so Mr. Giles sat with his legs stretched out\r\n",
      "before the kitchen fender, leaning his left arm on the table, while,\r\n",
      "with his right, he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of\r\n",
      "the robbery, to which his bearers (but especially the cook and\r\n",
      "housemaid, who were of the party) listened with breathless interest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It was about half-past two,' said Mr. Giles, 'or I wouldn't swear that\r\n",
      "it mightn't have been a little nearer three, when I woke up, and,\r\n",
      "turning round in my bed, as it might be so, (here Mr. Giles turned\r\n",
      "round in his chair, and pulled the corner of the table-cloth over him\r\n",
      "to imitate bed-clothes,) I fancied I heerd a noise.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked the\r\n",
      "housemaid to shut the door: who asked Brittles, who asked the tinker,\r\n",
      "who pretended not to hear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'--Heerd a noise,' continued Mr. Giles.  'I says, at first, \"This is\r\n",
      "illusion\"; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd the\r\n",
      "noise again, distinct.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What sort of a noise?' asked the cook.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A kind of a busting noise,' replied Mr. Giles, looking round him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'More like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater,'\r\n",
      "suggested Brittles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It was, when _you_ heerd it, sir,' rejoined Mr. Giles; 'but, at this\r\n",
      "time, it had a busting sound.  I turned down the clothes'; continued\r\n",
      "Giles, rolling back the table-cloth, 'sat up in bed; and listened.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated 'Lor!' and drew their\r\n",
      "chairs closer together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I heerd it now, quite apparent,' resumed Mr. Giles. '\"Somebody,\" I\r\n",
      "says, \"is forcing of a door, or window; what's to be done? I'll call up\r\n",
      "that poor lad, Brittles, and save him from being murdered in his bed;\r\n",
      "or his throat,\" I says, \"may be cut from his right ear to his left,\r\n",
      "without his ever knowing it.\"'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his upon the\r\n",
      "speaker, and stared at him, with his mouth wide open, and his face\r\n",
      "expressive of the most unmitigated horror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I tossed off the clothes,' said Giles, throwing away the table-cloth,\r\n",
      "and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid, 'got softly out of\r\n",
      "bed; drew on a pair of--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ladies present, Mr. Giles,' murmured the tinker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'--Of _shoes_, sir,' said Giles, turning upon him, and laying great\r\n",
      "emphasis on the word; 'seized the loaded pistol that always goes\r\n",
      "upstairs with the plate-basket; and walked on tiptoes to his room.\r\n",
      "\"Brittles,\" I says, when I had woke him, \"don't be frightened!\"'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So you did,' observed Brittles, in a low voice.\r\n",

      "'_Was_ he frightened?' asked the cook.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "'from a woman, nothing else was to be expected. We, being men, took a\r\n",
      "dark lantern that was standing on Brittle's hob, and groped our way\r\n",
      "downstairs in the pitch dark,--as it might be so.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Giles had risen from his seat, and taken two steps with his eyes\r\n",
      "shut, to accompany his description with appropriate action, when he\r\n",
      "started violently, in common with the rest of the company, and hurried\r\n",
      "back to his chair.  The cook and housemaid screamed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It was a knock,' said Mr. Giles, assuming perfect serenity. 'Open the\r\n",

      "the morning,' said Mr. Giles, surveying the pale faces which surrounded\r\n",
      "him, and looking very blank himself; 'but the door must be opened.  Do\r\n",
      "you hear, somebody?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Giles, as he spoke, looked at Brittles; but that young man, being\r\n",
      "naturally modest, probably considered himself nobody, and so held that\r\n",
      "the inquiry could not have any application to him; at all events, he\r\n",
      "tendered no reply. Mr. Giles directed an appealing glance at the\r\n",
      "tinker; but he had suddenly fallen asleep.  The women were out of the\r\n",
      "question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "'So am I,' said the tinker, waking up, as suddenly as he had fallen\r\n",
      "asleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat\r\n",
      "re-assured by the discovery (made on throwing open the shutters) that\r\n",
      "it was now broad day, took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front.\r\n",
      "The two women, who were afraid to stay below, brought up the rear.  By\r\n",
      "the advice of Mr. Giles, they all talked very loud, to warn any\r\n",
      "evil-disposed person outside, that they were strong in numbers; and by\r\n",
      "a master-stoke of policy, originating in the brain of the same\r\n",
      "ingenious gentleman, the dogs' tails were well pinched, in the hall, to\r\n",
      "make them bark savagely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These precautions having been taken, Mr. Giles held on fast by the\r\n",
      "tinker's arm (to prevent his running away, as he pleasantly said), and\r\n",
      "gave the word of command to open the door.  Brittles obeyed; the group,\r\n",
      "peeping timorously over each other's shoulders, beheld no more\r\n",
      "formidable object than poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and\r\n",
      "exhausted, who raised his heavy eyes, and mutely solicited their\r\n",
      "compassion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A boy!' exclaimed Mr. Giles, valiantly, pushing the tinker into the\r\n",

      "here--don't you know?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw Oliver,\r\n",
      "than he uttered a loud cry.  Mr. Giles, seizing the boy by one leg and\r\n",
      "one arm (fortunately not the broken limb) lugged him straight into the\r\n",
      "hall, and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Here he is!' bawled Giles, calling in a state of great excitement, up\r\n",
      "the staircase; 'here's one of the thieves, ma'am! Here's a thief, miss!\r\n",
      "Wounded, miss!  I shot him, miss; and Brittles held the light.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'--In a lantern, miss,' cried Brittles, applying one hand to the side\r\n",
      "of his mouth, so that his voice might travel the better.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two women-servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr.\r\n",
      "Giles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in\r\n",
      "endeavouring to restore Oliver, lest he should die before he could be\r\n",
      "hanged.  In the midst of all this noise and commotion, there was heard\r\n",
      "a sweet female voice, which quelled it in an instant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Giles!' whispered the voice from the stair-head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'm here, miss,' replied Mr. Giles.  'Don't be frightened, miss; I\r\n",
      "ain't much injured.  He didn't make a very desperate resistance, miss!\r\n",
      "I was soon too many for him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hush!' replied the young lady; 'you frighten my aunt as much as the\r\n",
      "thieves did.  Is the poor creature much hurt?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Wounded desperate, miss,' replied Giles, with indescribable\r\n",
      "complacency.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He looks as if he was a-going, miss,' bawled Brittles, in the same\r\n",
      "manner as before.  'Wouldn't you like to come and look at him, miss, in\r\n",
      "case he should?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hush, pray; there's a good man!' rejoined the lady.  'Wait quietly\r\n",
      "only one instant, while I speak to aunt.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice, the speaker tripped\r\n",
      "away.  She soon returned, with the direction that the wounded person\r\n",
      "was to be carried, carefully, upstairs to Mr. Giles's room; and that\r\n",
      "Brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to\r\n",
      "Chertsey:  from which place, he was to despatch, with all speed, a\r\n",
      "constable and doctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'But won't you take one look at him, first, miss?' asked Mr. Giles,\r\n",
      "with as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage, that he\r\n",
      "had skilfully brought down.  'Not one little peep, miss?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not now, for the world,' replied the young lady.  'Poor fellow! Oh!\r\n",
      "treat him kindly, Giles for my sake!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away, with a\r\n",
      "glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child.  Then,\r\n",
      "bending over Oliver, he helped to carry him upstairs, with the care and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In a handsome room:  though its furniture had rather the air of\r\n",

      "at a well-spread breakfast-table.  Mr. Giles, dressed with scrupulous\r\n",

      "taken his station some half-way between the side-board and the\r\n",

      "Of the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high-backed\r\n",
      "oaken chair in which she sat, was not more upright than she.  Dressed\r\n",
      "with the utmost nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by-gone\r\n",
      "costume, with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which\r\n",
      "rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its\r\n",
      "effect, she sat, in a stately manner, with her hands folded on the\r\n",
      "table before her.  Her eyes (and age had dimmed but little of their\r\n",

      "element, nor its rough creatures her fit companions.  The very\r\n",
      "intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her\r\n",

      "back her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into\r\n",

      "'Honour, eh?' said the doctor; 'well, I don't know; perhaps it's as\r\n",
      "honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your man at\r\n",
      "twelve paces.  Fancy that he fired in the air, and you've fought a\r\n",

      "surgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles\r\n",
      "round as 'the doctor,' had grown fat, more from good-humour than from\r\n",
      "good living:  and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The doctor was absent, much longer than either he or the ladies had\r\n",

      "a bedroom-door, 'let us hear what you think of him.  He has not been\r\n",
      "shaved very recently, but he don't look at all ferocious\r\n",
      "notwithstanding.  Stop, though!  Let me first see that he is in\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Stepping before them, he looked into the room.  Motioning them to\r\n",

      "the curtains of the bed.  Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged\r\n",
      "ruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child:  worn with\r\n",
      "pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep.  His wounded arm,\r\n",
      "bound and splintered up, was crossed upon his breast; his head reclined\r\n",
      "upon the other arm, which was half hidden by his long hair, as it\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity\r\n",
      "and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection\r\n",
      "he had never known.  Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of\r\n",
      "water in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a\r\n",
      "familiar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes\r\n",

      "been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?' said\r\n",
      "Rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The surgeon shook his head, in a manner which intimated that he feared\r\n",
      "it was very possible; and observing that they might disturb the\r\n",
      "patient, led the way into an adjoining apartment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'But even if he has been wicked,' pursued Rose, 'think how young he is;\r\n",
      "think that he may never have known a mother's love, or the comfort of a\r\n",
      "home; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven\r\n",
      "him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt.  Aunt, dear aunt,\r\n",
      "for mercy's sake, think of this, before you let them drag this sick\r\n",
      "child to a prison, which in any case must be the grave of all his\r\n",
      "chances of amendment.  Oh! as you love me, and know that I have never\r\n",
      "felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection, but that I\r\n",
      "might have done so, and might have been equally helpless and\r\n",
      "unprotected with this poor child, have pity upon him before it is too\r\n",
      "late!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'My dear love,' said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to\r\n",
      "her bosom, 'do you think I would harm a hair of his head?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, no!' replied Rose, eagerly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, surely,' said the old lady; 'my days are drawing to their close:\r\n",
      "and may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others! What can I do to\r\n",
      "save him, sir?'\r\n",

      "Mr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets, and took several turns\r\n",
      "up and down the room; often stopping, and balancing himself on his\r\n",
      "toes, and frowning frightfully.  After various exclamations of 'I've\r\n",
      "got it now' and 'no, I haven't,' and as many renewals of the walking\r\n",
      "and frowning, he at length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles,\r\n",
      "and that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it.  Giles is a faithful\r\n",
      "fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a\r\n",
      "thousand ways, and reward him for being such a good shot besides.  You\r\n",
      "don't object to that?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Unless there is some other way of preserving the child,' replied Mrs.\r\n",
      "Maylie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There is no other,' said the doctor.  'No other, take my word for it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then my aunt invests you with full power,' said Rose, smiling through\r\n",
      "her tears; 'but pray don't be harder upon the poor fellows than is\r\n",
      "indispensably necessary.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You seem to think,' retorted the doctor, 'that everybody is disposed\r\n",
      "to be hard-hearted to-day, except yourself, Miss Rose. I only hope, for\r\n",
      "the sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as\r\n",
      "vulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow\r\n",
      "who appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that\r\n",
      "I might avail myself, on the spot, of such a favourable opportunity for\r\n",
      "doing so, as the present.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "blushing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well,' said the doctor, laughing heartily, 'that is no very difficult\r\n",
      "matter.  But to return to this boy.  The great point of our agreement\r\n",
      "is yet to come.  He will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and\r\n",
      "although I have told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that\r\n",
      "he musn't be moved or spoken to, on peril of his life, I think we may\r\n",
      "converse with him without danger.  Now I make this stipulation--that I\r\n",
      "shall examine him in your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we\r\n",
      "judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he\r\n",
      "is a real and thorough bad one (which is more than possible), he shall\r\n",
      "be left to his fate, without any farther interference on my part, at\r\n",
      "all events.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh no, aunt!' entreated Rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh yes, aunt!' said the doctor.  'Is is a bargain?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He cannot be hardened in vice,' said Rose; 'It is impossible.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Very good,' retorted the doctor; 'then so much the more reason for\r\n",
      "acceding to my proposition.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down\r\n",
      "to wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial\r\n",
      "than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed\r\n",
      "on, and still Oliver slumbered heavily.  It was evening, indeed, before\r\n",
      "the kind-hearted doctor brought them the intelligence, that he was at\r\n",
      "length sufficiently restored to be spoken to.  The boy was very ill, he\r\n",
      "said, and weak from the loss of blood; but his mind was so troubled\r\n",
      "with anxiety to disclose something, that he deemed it better to give\r\n",
      "him the opportunity, than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next\r\n",
      "morning: which he should otherwise have done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The conference was a long one.  Oliver told them all his simple\r\n",
      "history, and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength.\r\n",
      "It was a solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice\r\n",
      "of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities\r\n",
      "which hard men had brought upon him.  Oh! if when we oppress and grind\r\n",
      "our fellow-creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences\r\n",
      "of human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly\r\n",
      "it is true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their\r\n",
      "after-vengeance on our heads; if we heard but one instant, in\r\n",
      "imagination, the deep testimony of dead men's voices, which no power\r\n",
      "can stifle, and no pride shut out; where would be the injury and\r\n",
      "injustice, the suffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day's\r\n",
      "life brings with it!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver's pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness\r\n",
      "and virtue watched him as he slept.  He felt calm and happy, and could\r\n",
      "have died without a murmur.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver composed to\r\n",
      "rest again, than the doctor, after wiping his eyes, and condemning them\r\n",
      "for being weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr.\r\n",
      "Giles.  And finding nobody about the parlours, it occurred to him, that\r\n",
      "he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the\r\n",
      "kitchen; so into the kitchen he went.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament,\r\n",
      "the women-servants, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the tinker (who had\r\n",
      "received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of\r\n",
      "the day, in consideration of his services), and the constable.  The\r\n",
      "latter gentleman had a large staff, a large head, large features, and\r\n",
      "large half-boots; and he looked as if he had been taking a\r\n",
      "proportionate allowance of ale--as indeed he had.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for\r\n",
      "Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor\r\n",
      "entered; Mr. Brittles, with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating\r\n",
      "everything, before his superior said it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Sit still!' said the doctor, waving his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Thank you, sir, said Mr. Giles.  'Misses wished some ale to be given\r\n",
      "out, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir,\r\n",
      "and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among 'em here.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen\r\n",
      "generally were understood to express the gratification they derived\r\n",
      "from Mr. Giles's condescension.  Mr. Giles looked round with a\r\n",
      "patronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved\r\n",
      "properly, he would never desert them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'How is the patient to-night, sir?' asked Giles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So-so'; returned the doctor.  'I am afraid you have got yourself into\r\n",
      "a scrape there, Mr. Giles.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I hope you don't mean to say, sir,' said Mr. Giles, trembling, 'that\r\n",
      "he's going to die.  If I thought it, I should never be happy again.  I\r\n",
      "wouldn't cut a boy off:  no, not even Brittles here; not for all the\r\n",
      "plate in the county, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's not the point,' said the doctor, mysteriously.  'Mr. Giles, are\r\n",
      "you a Protestant?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, sir, I hope so,' faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very pale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And what are _you_, boy?' said the doctor, turning sharply upon\r\n",
      "Brittles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Lord bless me, sir!' replied Brittles, starting violently; 'I'm the\r\n",
      "same as Mr. Giles, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then tell me this,' said the doctor, 'both of you, both of you! Are\r\n",
      "you going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is\r\n",
      "the boy that was put through the little window last night?  Out with\r\n",
      "it!  Come!  We are prepared for you!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The doctor, who was universally considered one of the best-tempered\r\n",
      "creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger,\r\n",
      "that Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and\r\n",
      "excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Pay attention to the reply, constable, will you?' said the doctor,\r\n",
      "shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the\r\n",
      "bridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy's\r\n",
      "utmost acuteness. 'Something may come of this before long.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The constable looked as wise as he could, and took up his staff of\r\n",
      "office: which had been reclining indolently in the chimney-corner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's a simple question of identity, you will observe,' said the doctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's what it is, sir,' replied the constable, coughing with great\r\n",
      "violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had\r\n",
      "gone the wrong way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Here's the house broken into,' said the doctor, 'and a couple of men\r\n",
      "catch one moment's glimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowder smoke,\r\n",
      "and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness.  Here's a boy comes\r\n",
      "to that very same house, next morning, and because he happens to have\r\n",
      "his arm tied up, these men lay violent hands upon him--by doing which,\r\n",
      "they place his life in great danger--and swear he is the thief.  Now,\r\n",
      "the question is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not,\r\n",
      "in what situation do they place themselves?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The constable nodded profoundly.  He said, if that wasn't law, he would\r\n",
      "be glad to know what was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I ask you again,' thundered the doctor, 'are you, on your solemn\r\n",
      "oaths, able to identify that boy?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at\r\n",
      "Brittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the\r\n",
      "reply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the\r\n",
      "doctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at\r\n",
      "the same moment, the sound of wheels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's the runners!' cried Brittles, to all appearance much relieved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The what?' exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his turn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The Bow Street officers, sir,' replied Brittles, taking up a candle;\r\n",
      "'me and Mr. Giles sent for 'em this morning.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What?' cried the doctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,' replied Brittles; 'I sent a message up by the coachman, and I\r\n",
      "only wonder they weren't here before, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You did, did you?  Then confound your--slow coaches down here; that's\r\n",

      "the chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Open the door,' replied a man outside; 'it's the officers from Bow\r\n",
      "Street, as was sent to to-day.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Much comforted by this assurance, Brittles opened the door to its full\r\n",
      "width, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in,\r\n",
      "without saying anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly\r\n",
      "as if he lived there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Just send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?' said\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Brittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building,\r\n",
      "the portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his\r\n",
      "companion to put up the gig:  while Brittles lighted them, in a state\r\n",
      "of great admiration.  This done, they returned to the house, and, being\r\n",
      "shown into a parlour, took off their great-coats and hats, and showed\r\n",
      "like what they were.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of middle\r\n",
      "height, aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close;\r\n",
      "half-whiskers, a round face, and sharp eyes.  The other was a\r\n",
      "red-headed, bony man, in top-boots; with a rather ill-favoured\r\n",
      "countenance, and a turned-up sinister-looking nose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Tell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?' said the\r\n",
      "stouter man, smoothing down his hair, and laying a pair of handcuffs on\r\n",
      "the table.  'Oh!  Good-evening, master.  Can I have a word or two with\r\n",
      "you in private, if you please?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who now made his appearance; that\r\n",
      "gentleman, motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two ladies, and\r\n",
      "shut the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Mrs. Maylie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Blathers made a bow.  Being desired to sit down, he put his hat on\r\n",
      "the floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the same.  The\r\n",
      "latter gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good\r\n",
      "society, or quite so much at his ease in it--one of the two--seated\r\n",
      "himself, after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and\r\n",
      "the head of his stick into his mouth, with some embarrassment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now, with regard to this here robbery, master,' said Blathers. 'What\r\n",
      "are the circumstances?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at\r\n",
      "great length, and with much circumlocution.  Messrs. Blathers and Duff\r\n",
      "looked very knowing meanwhile, and occasionally exchanged a nod.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I can't say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,' said\r\n",
      "Blathers; 'but my opinion at once is,--I don't mind committing myself\r\n",
      "to that extent,--that this wasn't done by a yokel; eh, Duff?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Certainly not,' replied Duff.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And, translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies, I\r\n",
      "apprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a\r\n",
      "countryman?' said Mr. Losberne, with a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's it, master,' replied Blathers.  'This is all about the robbery,\r\n",
      "is it?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'All,' replied the doctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a-talking\r\n",
      "on?' said Blathers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing at all,' replied the doctor.  'One of the frightened servants\r\n",
      "chose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this\r\n",
      "attempt to break into the house; but it's nonsense: sheer absurdity.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Wery easy disposed of, if it is,' remarked Duff.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What he says is quite correct,' observed Blathers, nodding his head in\r\n",
      "a confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if\r\n",
      "they were a pair of castanets.  'Who is the boy? What account does he\r\n",
      "give of himself?  Where did he come from? He didn't drop out of the\r\n",
      "clouds, did he, master?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Of course not,' replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the two\r\n",
      "ladies.  'I know his whole history: but we can talk about that\r\n",
      "presently.  You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves\r\n",
      "made their attempt, I suppose?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Certainly,' rejoined Mr. Blathers.  'We had better inspect the\r\n",
      "premises first, and examine the servants afterwards. That's the usual\r\n",
      "way of doing business.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lights were then procured; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff, attended by\r\n",
      "the native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in short,\r\n",
      "went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at\r\n",
      "the window; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in\r\n",
      "at the window; and after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the\r\n",
      "shutter with; and after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with;\r\n",
      "and after that, a pitchfork to poke the bushes with.  This done, amidst\r\n",
      "the breathless interest of all beholders, they came in again; and Mr.\r\n",
      "Giles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of\r\n",
      "their share in the previous night's adventures: which they performed\r\n",
      "some six times over: contradicting each other, in not more than one\r\n",
      "important respect, the first time, and in not more than a dozen the\r\n",
      "last.  This consummation being arrived at, Blathers and Duff cleared\r\n",
      "the room, and held a long council together, compared with which, for\r\n",
      "secrecy and solemnity, a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest\r\n",
      "point in medicine, would be mere child's play.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy\r\n",
      "state; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Upon my word,' he said, making a halt, after a great number of very\r\n",
      "rapid turns, 'I hardly know what to do.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Surely,' said Rose, 'the poor child's story, faithfully repeated to\r\n",
      "these men, will be sufficient to exonerate him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I doubt it, my dear young lady,' said the doctor, shaking his head.\r\n",
      "'I don't think it would exonerate him, either with them, or with legal\r\n",
      "functionaries of a higher grade.  What is he, after all, they would\r\n",
      "say?  A runaway.  Judged by mere worldly considerations and\r\n",
      "probabilities, his story is a very doubtful one.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You believe it, surely?' interrupted Rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'_I_ believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old fool for\r\n",
      "doing so,' rejoined the doctor; 'but I don't think it is exactly the\r\n",
      "tale for a practical police-officer, nevertheless.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why not?' demanded Rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Because, my pretty cross-examiner,' replied the doctor: 'because,\r\n",
      "viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he can\r\n",
      "only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well.\r\n",
      "Confound the fellows, they _will_ have the why and the wherefore, and\r\n",
      "will take nothing for granted.  On his own showing, you see, he has\r\n",
      "been the companion of thieves for some time past; he has been carried\r\n",
      "to a police-officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman's pocket; he\r\n",
      "has been taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman's house, to a place\r\n",
      "which he cannot describe or point out, and of the situation of which he\r\n",
      "has not the remotest idea.  He is brought down to Chertsey, by men who\r\n",
      "seem to have taken a violent fancy to him, whether he will or no; and\r\n",
      "is put through a window to rob a house; and then, just at the very\r\n",
      "moment when he is going to alarm the inmates, and so do the very thing\r\n",
      "that would set him all to rights, there rushes into the way, a\r\n",
      "blundering dog of a half-bred butler, and shoots him! As if on purpose\r\n",
      "to prevent his doing any good for himself! Don't you see all this?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I see it, of course,' replied Rose, smiling at the doctor's\r\n",
      "impetuosity; 'but still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the\r\n",
      "poor child.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' replied the doctor; 'of course not!  Bless the bright eyes of\r\n",
      "your sex!  They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side\r\n",
      "of any question; and that is, always, the one which first presents\r\n",
      "itself to them.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put his\r\n",
      "hands into his pockets, and walked up and down the room with even\r\n",
      "greater rapidity than before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The more I think of it,' said the doctor, 'the more I see that it will\r\n",
      "occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in\r\n",
      "possession of the boy's real story.  I am certain it will not be\r\n",
      "believed; and even if they can do nothing to him in the end, still the\r\n",
      "dragging it forward, and giving publicity to all the doubts that will\r\n",
      "be cast upon it, must interfere, materially, with your benevolent plan\r\n",
      "of rescuing him from misery.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh! what is to be done?' cried Rose.  'Dear, dear! why did they send\r\n",
      "for these people?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, indeed!' exclaimed Mrs. Maylie.  'I would not have had them here,\r\n",
      "for the world.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'All I know is,' said Mr. Losberne, at last:  sitting down with a kind\r\n",
      "of desperate calmness, 'that we must try and carry it off with a bold\r\n",
      "face.  The object is a good one, and that must be our excuse.  The boy\r\n",
      "has strong symptoms of fever upon him, and is in no condition to be\r\n",
      "talked to any more; that's one comfort.  We must make the best of it;\r\n",
      "and if bad be the best, it is no fault of ours.  Come in!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, master,' said Blathers, entering the room followed by his\r\n",
      "colleague, and making the door fast, before he said any more. 'This\r\n",
      "warn't a put-up thing.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And what the devil's a put-up thing?' demanded the doctor, impatiently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We call it a put-up robbery, ladies,' said Blathers, turning to them,\r\n",
      "as if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor's,\r\n",
      "'when the servants is in it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nobody suspected them, in this case,' said Mrs. Maylie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Wery likely not, ma'am,' replied Blathers; 'but they might have been\r\n",
      "in it, for all that.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'More likely on that wery account,' said Duff.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We find it was a town hand,' said Blathers, continuing his report;\r\n",
      "'for the style of work is first-rate.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Wery pretty indeed it is,' remarked Duff, in an undertone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There was two of 'em in it,' continued Blathers; 'and they had a boy\r\n",
      "with 'em; that's plain from the size of the window.  That's all to be\r\n",
      "said at present.  We'll see this lad that you've got upstairs at once,\r\n",
      "if you please.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Perhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs. Maylie?' said\r\n",
      "the doctor: his face brightening, as if some new thought had occurred\r\n",
      "to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh! to be sure!' exclaimed Rose, eagerly.  'You shall have it\r\n",
      "immediately, if you will.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, thank you, miss!' said Blathers, drawing his coat-sleeve across\r\n",
      "his mouth; 'it's dry work, this sort of duty.  Anythink that's handy,\r\n",
      "miss; don't put yourself out of the way, on our accounts.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What shall it be?' asked the doctor, following the young lady to the\r\n",
      "sideboard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A little drop of spirits, master, if it's all the same,' replied\r\n",
      "Blathers.  'It's a cold ride from London, ma'am; and I always find that\r\n",
      "spirits comes home warmer to the feelings.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who\r\n",
      "received it very graciously.  While it was being conveyed to her, the\r\n",
      "doctor slipped out of the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah!' said Mr. Blathers:  not holding his wine-glass by the stem, but\r\n",
      "grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand:\r\n",
      "and placing it in front of his chest; 'I have seen a good many pieces\r\n",
      "of business like this, in my time, ladies.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That crack down in the back lane at Edmonton, Blathers,' said Mr.\r\n",
      "Duff, assisting his colleague's memory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That was something in this way, warn't it?' rejoined Mr. Blathers;\r\n",
      "'that was done by Conkey Chickweed, that was.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You always gave that to him' replied Duff.  'It was the Family Pet, I\r\n",
      "tell you.  Conkey hadn't any more to do with it than I had.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Get out!' retorted Mr. Blathers; 'I know better.  Do you mind that\r\n",
      "time when Conkey was robbed of his money, though?  What a start that\r\n",
      "was!  Better than any novel-book _I_ ever see!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What was that?' inquired Rose:  anxious to encourage any symptoms of\r\n",
      "good-humour in the unwelcome visitors.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down\r\n",
      "upon,' said Blathers.  'This here Conkey Chickweed--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Conkey means Nosey, ma'am,' interposed Duff.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Of course the lady knows that, don't she?' demanded Mr. Blathers.\r\n",
      "'Always interrupting, you are, partner!  This here Conkey Chickweed,\r\n",
      "miss, kept a public-house over Battlebridge way, and he had a cellar,\r\n",
      "where a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting, and\r\n",
      "badger-drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was\r\n",
      "conducted in, for I've seen 'em off'en.  He warn't one of the family,\r\n",
      "at that time; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and\r\n",
      "twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was stole out of his bedroom\r\n",
      "in the dead of night, by a tall man with a black patch over his eye,\r\n",
      "who had concealed himself under the bed, and after committing the\r\n",
      "robbery, jumped slap out of window:  which was only a story high. He\r\n",
      "was wery quick about it.  But Conkey was quick, too; for he fired a\r\n",
      "blunderbuss arter him, and roused the neighbourhood. They set up a\r\n",
      "hue-and-cry, directly, and when they came to look about 'em, found that\r\n",
      "Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood, all the way\r\n",
      "to some palings a good distance off; and there they lost 'em.  However,\r\n",
      "he had made off with the blunt; and, consequently, the name of Mr.\r\n",
      "Chickweed, licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette among the other\r\n",
      "bankrupts; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I don't\r\n",
      "know what all, was got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state\r\n",
      "of mind about his loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or\r\n",
      "four days, a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many\r\n",
      "people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself. One day\r\n",
      "he came up to the office, all in a hurry, and had a private interview\r\n",
      "with the magistrate, who, after a deal of talk, rings the bell, and\r\n",
      "orders Jem Spyers in (Jem was a active officer), and tells him to go\r\n",
      "and assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house.\r\n",
      "\"I see him, Spyers,\" said Chickweed, \"pass my house yesterday morning,\"\r\n",
      "\"Why didn't you up, and collar him!\" says Spyers.  \"I was so struck all\r\n",
      "of a heap, that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick,\"\r\n",
      "says the poor man; \"but we're sure to have him; for between ten and\r\n",
      "eleven o'clock at night he passed again.\"  Spyers no sooner heard this,\r\n",
      "than he put some clean linen and a comb, in his pocket, in case he\r\n",
      "should have to stop a day or two; and away he goes, and sets himself\r\n",
      "down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain,\r\n",
      "with his hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a moment's notice. He was\r\n",
      "smoking his pipe here, late at night, when all of a sudden Chickweed\r\n",
      "roars out, \"Here he is! Stop thief!  Murder!\"  Jem Spyers dashes out;\r\n",
      "and there he sees Chickweed, a-tearing down the street full cry.  Away\r\n",
      "goes Spyers; on goes Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody roars\r\n",
      "out, \"Thieves!\" and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting, all the time,\r\n",
      "like mad.  Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner;\r\n",
      "shoots round; sees a little crowd; dives in; \"Which is the man?\"\r\n",
      "\"D--me!\" says Chickweed, \"I've lost him again!\"  It was a remarkable\r\n",
      "occurrence, but he warn't to be seen nowhere, so they went back to the\r\n",
      "public-house. Next morning, Spyers took his old place, and looked out,\r\n",
      "from behind the curtain, for a tall man with a black patch over his\r\n",
      "eye, till his own two eyes ached again.  At last, he couldn't help\r\n",
      "shutting 'em, to ease 'em a minute; and the very moment he did so, he\r\n",
      "hears Chickweed a-roaring out, \"Here he is!\"  Off he starts once more,\r\n",
      "with Chickweed half-way down the street ahead of him; and after twice\r\n",
      "as long a run as the yesterday's one, the man's lost again!  This was\r\n",
      "done, once or twice more, till one-half the neighbours gave out that\r\n",
      "Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil, who was playing tricks with\r\n",
      "him arterwards; and the other half, that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone\r\n",
      "mad with grief.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What did Jem Spyers say?' inquired the doctor; who had returned to the\r\n",
      "room shortly after the commencement of the story.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Jem Spyers,' resumed the officer, 'for a long time said nothing at\r\n",
      "all, and listened to everything without seeming to, which showed he\r\n",
      "understood his business.  But, one morning, he walked into the bar, and\r\n",
      "taking out his snuffbox, says \"Chickweed, I've found out who done this\r\n",
      "here robbery.\"  \"Have you?\" said Chickweed.  \"Oh, my dear Spyers, only\r\n",
      "let me have wengeance, and I shall die contented!  Oh, my dear Spyers,\r\n",
      "where is the villain!\"  \"Come!\" said Spyers, offering him a pinch of\r\n",
      "snuff, \"none of that gammon!  You did it yourself.\"  So he had; and a\r\n",
      "good bit of money he had made by it, too; and nobody would never have\r\n",
      "found it out, if he hadn't been so precious anxious to keep up\r\n",
      "appearances!' said Mr. Blathers, putting down his wine-glass, and\r\n",
      "clinking the handcuffs together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Very curious, indeed,' observed the doctor.  'Now, if you please, you\r\n",
      "can walk upstairs.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If _you_ please, sir,' returned Mr. Blathers.  Closely following Mr.\r\n",
      "Losberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver's bedroom; Mr. Giles\r\n",
      "preceding the party, with a lighted candle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he\r\n",
      "had appeared yet.  Being assisted by the doctor, he managed to sit up\r\n",
      "in bed for a minute or so; and looked at the strangers without at all\r\n",
      "understanding what was going forward--in fact, without seeming to\r\n",
      "recollect where he was, or what had been passing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This,' said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence\r\n",
      "notwithstanding, 'this is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a\r\n",
      "spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d' ye-call-him's\r\n",
      "grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this\r\n",
      "morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that\r\n",
      "ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand:  who has placed his\r\n",
      "life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus\r\n",
      "recommended to their notice.  The bewildered butler gazed from them\r\n",
      "towards Oliver, and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a most\r\n",
      "ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You don't mean to deny that, I suppose?' said the doctor, laying\r\n",
      "Oliver gently down again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It was all done for the--for the best, sir,' answered Giles. 'I am\r\n",
      "sure I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn't have meddled with him.  I\r\n",
      "am not of an inhuman disposition, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Thought it was what boy?' inquired the senior officer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The housebreaker's boy, sir!' replied Giles.  'They--they certainly\r\n",
      "had a boy.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well?  Do you think so now?' inquired Blathers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Think what, now?' replied Giles, looking vacantly at his questioner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Think it's the same boy, Stupid-head?' rejoined Blathers, impatiently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't know; I really don't know,' said Giles, with a rueful\r\n",
      "countenance.  'I couldn't swear to him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What do you think?' asked Mr. Blathers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't know what to think,' replied poor Giles.  'I don't think it is\r\n",
      "the boy; indeed, I'm almost certain that it isn't.  You know it can't\r\n",
      "be.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Has this man been a-drinking, sir?' inquired Blathers, turning to the\r\n",
      "doctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What a precious muddle-headed chap you are!' said Duff, addressing Mr.\r\n",
      "Giles, with supreme contempt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Losberne had been feeling the patient's pulse during this short\r\n",
      "dialogue; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked,\r\n",
      "that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would\r\n",
      "perhaps like to step into the next room, and have Brittles before them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring\r\n",
      "apartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and\r\n",
      "his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions\r\n",
      "and impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on\r\n",
      "anything, but the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed,\r\n",
      "his declarations that he shouldn't know the real boy, if he were put\r\n",
      "before him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he,\r\n",
      "because Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes\r\n",
      "previously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much\r\n",
      "afraid he had been a little too hasty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Among other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether\r\n",
      "Mr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow\r\n",
      "pistol to that which he had fired, it turned out to have no more\r\n",
      "destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which\r\n",
      "made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had\r\n",
      "drawn the ball about ten minutes before. Upon no one, however, did it\r\n",
      "make a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after\r\n",
      "labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a\r\n",
      "fellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to\r\n",
      "the utmost.  Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very\r\n",
      "much about Oliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took\r\n",
      "up their rest for that night in the town; promising to return the next\r\n",
      "morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were\r\n",
      "in the cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under\r\n",
      "suspicious circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff\r\n",
      "journeyed accordingly. The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving\r\n",
      "themselves, on investigation, into the one fact, that they had been\r\n",
      "discovered sleeping under a haystack; which, although a great crime, is\r\n",
      "only punishable by imprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the\r\n",
      "English law, and its comprehensive love of all the King's subjects,\r\n",
      "held to be no satisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence,\r\n",
      "that the sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied with\r\n",
      "violence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the\r\n",
      "punishment of death; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again, as wise\r\n",
      "as they went.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In short, after some more examination, and a great deal more\r\n",
      "conversation, a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the\r\n",
      "joint bail of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver's appearance if\r\n",
      "he should ever be called upon; and Blathers and Duff, being rewarded\r\n",
      "with a couple of guineas, returned to town with divided opinions on the\r\n",
      "subject of their expedition: the latter gentleman on a mature\r\n",
      "consideration of all the circumstances, inclining to the belief that\r\n",
      "the burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet; and the\r\n",
      "former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the\r\n",
      "great Mr. Conkey Chickweed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "OF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND FRIENDS\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver's ailings were neither slight nor few.  In addition to the pain\r\n",
      "and delay attendant on a broken limb, his exposure to the wet and cold\r\n",
      "had brought on fever and ague:  which hung about him for many weeks,\r\n",
      "and reduced him sadly. But, at length, he began, by slow degrees, to\r\n",
      "get better, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few tearful words,\r\n",
      "how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how\r\n",
      "ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again, he could do\r\n",
      "something to show his gratitude; only something, which would let them\r\n",
      "see the love and duty with which his breast was full; something,\r\n",
      "however slight, which would prove to them that their gentle kindness\r\n",
      "had not been cast away; but that the poor boy whom their charity had\r\n",
      "rescued from misery, or death, was eager to serve them with his whole\r\n",
      "heart and soul.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Poor fellow!' said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly\r\n",
      "endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale\r\n",
      "lips; 'you shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will.\r\n",
      "We are going into the country, and my aunt intends that you shall\r\n",
      "accompany us.  The quiet place, the pure air, and all the pleasure and\r\n",
      "beauties of spring, will restore you in a few days.  We will employ you\r\n",
      "in a hundred ways, when you can bear the trouble.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The trouble!' cried Oliver.  'Oh! dear lady, if I could but work for\r\n",
      "you; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers, or\r\n",
      "watching your birds, or running up and down the whole day long, to make\r\n",
      "you happy; what would I give to do it!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You shall give nothing at all,' said Miss Maylie, smiling; 'for, as I\r\n",
      "told you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if you only\r\n",
      "take half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make\r\n",
      "me very happy indeed.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Happy, ma'am!' cried Oliver; 'how kind of you to say so!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You will make me happier than I can tell you,' replied the young lady.\r\n",
      "'To think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing\r\n",
      "any one from such sad misery as you have described to us, would be an\r\n",
      "unspeakable pleasure to me; but to know that the object of her goodness\r\n",
      "and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached, in consequence,\r\n",
      "would delight me, more than you can well imagine.  Do you understand\r\n",
      "me?' she inquired, watching Oliver's thoughtful face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh yes, ma'am, yes!' replied Oliver eagerly; 'but I was thinking that\r\n",
      "I am ungrateful now.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'To whom?' inquired the young lady.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'To the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care\r\n",
      "of me before,' rejoined Oliver.  'If they knew how happy I am, they\r\n",
      "would be pleased, I am sure.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I am sure they would,' rejoined Oliver's benefactress; 'and Mr.\r\n",
      "Losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well\r\n",
      "enough to bear the journey, he will carry you to see them.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Has he, ma'am?' cried Oliver, his face brightening with pleasure.  'I\r\n",
      "don't know what I shall do for joy when I see their kind faces once\r\n",
      "again!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the\r\n",
      "fatigue of this expedition.  One morning he and Mr. Losberne set out,\r\n",
      "accordingly, in a little carriage which belonged to Mrs. Maylie.  When\r\n",
      "they came to Chertsey Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a\r\n",
      "loud exclamation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's the matter with the boy?' cried the doctor, as usual, all in a\r\n",
      "bustle.  'Do you see anything--hear anything--feel anything--eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That, sir,' cried Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window. 'That\r\n",
      "house!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes; well, what of it?  Stop coachman.  Pull up here,' cried the\r\n",
      "doctor.  'What of the house, my man; eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The thieves--the house they took me to!' whispered Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The devil it is!' cried the doctor.  'Hallo, there! let me out!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, before the coachman could dismount from his box, he had tumbled\r\n",
      "out of the coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the\r\n",
      "deserted tenement, began kicking at the door like a madman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Halloa?' said a little ugly hump-backed man:  opening the door so\r\n",
      "suddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his last kick,\r\n",
      "nearly fell forward into the passage. 'What's the matter here?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Matter!' exclaimed the other, collaring him, without a moment's\r\n",
      "reflection.  'A good deal.  Robbery is the matter.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There'll be Murder the matter, too,' replied the hump-backed man,\r\n",
      "coolly, 'if you don't take your hands off.  Do you hear me?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I hear you,' said the doctor, giving his captive a hearty shake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Where's--confound the fellow, what's his rascally name--Sikes; that's\r\n",
      "it.  Where's Sikes, you thief?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The hump-backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and\r\n",
      "indignation; then, twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor's\r\n",
      "grasp, growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the\r\n",
      "house.  Before he could shut the door, however, the doctor had passed\r\n",
      "into the parlour, without a word of parley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige\r\n",
      "of anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the\r\n",
      "cupboards; answered Oliver's description!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now!' said the hump-backed man, who had watched him keenly, 'what do\r\n",
      "you mean by coming into my house, in this violent way? Do you want to\r\n",
      "rob me, or to murder me?  Which is it?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Did you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and pair,\r\n",
      "you ridiculous old vampire?' said the irritable doctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What do you want, then?' demanded the hunchback.  'Will you take\r\n",
      "yourself off, before I do you a mischief?  Curse you!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'As soon as I think proper,' said Mr. Losberne, looking into the other\r\n",
      "parlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to\r\n",
      "Oliver's account of it.  'I shall find you out, some day, my friend.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Will you?' sneered the ill-favoured cripple.  'If you ever want me,\r\n",
      "I'm here.  I haven't lived here mad and all alone, for five-and-twenty\r\n",
      "years, to be scared by you.  You shall pay for this; you shall pay for\r\n",
      "this.'  And so saying, the mis-shapen little demon set up a yell, and\r\n",
      "danced upon the ground, as if wild with rage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stupid enough, this,' muttered the doctor to himself; 'the boy must\r\n",
      "have made a mistake.  Here!  Put that in your pocket, and shut yourself\r\n",
      "up again.'  With these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money,\r\n",
      "and returned to the carriage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest imprecations\r\n",
      "and curses all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the\r\n",
      "driver, he looked into the carriage, and eyed Oliver for an instant\r\n",
      "with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and\r\n",
      "vindictive, that, waking or sleeping, he could not forget it for months\r\n",
      "afterwards.  He continued to utter the most fearful imprecations, until\r\n",
      "the driver had resumed his seat; and when they were once more on their\r\n",
      "way, they could see him some distance behind: beating his feet upon the\r\n",
      "ground, and tearing his hair, in transports of real or pretended rage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I am an ass!' said the doctor, after a long silence.  'Did you know\r\n",
      "that before, Oliver?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then don't forget it another time.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'An ass,' said the doctor again, after a further silence of some\r\n",
      "minutes.  'Even if it had been the right place, and the right fellows\r\n",
      "had been there, what could I have done, single-handed? And if I had had\r\n",
      "assistance, I see no good that I should have done, except leading to my\r\n",
      "own exposure, and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which I\r\n",
      "have hushed up this business. That would have served me right, though.\r\n",
      "I am always involving myself in some scrape or other, by acting on\r\n",
      "impulse.  It might have done me good.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon\r\n",
      "anything but impulse all through his life, and it was no bad compliment\r\n",
      "to the nature of the impulses which governed him, that so far from\r\n",
      "being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes, he had the\r\n",
      "warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him.  If the truth must be\r\n",
      "told, he was a little out of temper, for a minute or two, at being\r\n",
      "disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of Oliver's story on\r\n",
      "the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any.  He\r\n",
      "soon came round again, however; and finding that Oliver's replies to\r\n",
      "his questions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and still\r\n",
      "delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as they had ever\r\n",
      "been, he made up his mind to attach full credence to them, from that\r\n",
      "time forth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided,\r\n",
      "they were enabled to drive straight thither.  When the coach turned\r\n",
      "into it, his heart beat so violently, that he could scarcely draw his\r\n",
      "breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now, my boy, which house is it?' inquired Mr. Losberne.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That!  That!' replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window.\r\n",
      "'The white house.  Oh! make haste!  Pray make haste! I feel as if I\r\n",
      "should die: it makes me tremble so.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come, come!' said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder. 'You\r\n",
      "will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and\r\n",
      "well.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh!  I hope so!' cried Oliver.  'They were so good to me; so very,\r\n",
      "very good to me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The coach rolled on.  It stopped.  No; that was the wrong house; the\r\n",
      "next door.  It went on a few paces, and stopped again. Oliver looked up\r\n",
      "at the windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alas! the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window.\r\n",
      "'To Let.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Knock at the next door,' cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver's arm in\r\n",
      "his.  'What has become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in the\r\n",
      "adjoining house, do you know?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The servant did not know; but would go and inquire.  She presently\r\n",
      "returned, and said, that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his goods, and gone\r\n",
      "to the West Indies, six weeks before.  Oliver clasped his hands, and\r\n",
      "sank feebly backward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Has his housekeeper gone too?' inquired Mr. Losberne, after a moment's\r\n",
      "pause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, sir'; replied the servant.  'The old gentleman, the housekeeper,\r\n",
      "and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow's, all went together.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then turn towards home again,' said Mr. Losberne to the driver; 'and\r\n",
      "don't stop to bait the horses, till you get out of this confounded\r\n",
      "London!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The book-stall keeper, sir?' said Oliver.  'I know the way there.  See\r\n",
      "him, pray, sir!  Do see him!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'My poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day,' said the\r\n",
      "doctor.  'Quite enough for both of us.  If we go to the book-stall\r\n",
      "keeper's, we shall certainly find that he is dead, or has set his house\r\n",
      "on fire, or run away.  No; home again straight!'  And in obedience to\r\n",
      "the doctor's impulse, home they went.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in\r\n",
      "the midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself, many times\r\n",
      "during his illness, with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bedwin would say to him: and what delight it would be to tell them how\r\n",
      "many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had\r\n",
      "done for him, and in bewailing his cruel separation from them. The hope\r\n",
      "of eventually clearing himself with them, too, and explaining how he\r\n",
      "had been forced away, had buoyed him up, and sustained him, under many\r\n",
      "of his recent trials; and now, the idea that they should have gone so\r\n",
      "far, and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a\r\n",
      "robber--a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying\r\n",
      "day--was almost more than he could bear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The circumstance occasioned no alteration, however, in the behaviour of\r\n",
      "his benefactors.  After another fortnight, when the fine warm weather\r\n",
      "had fairly begun, and every tree and flower was putting forth its young\r\n",
      "leaves and rich blossoms, they made preparations for quitting the house\r\n",
      "at Chertsey, for some months.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sending the plate, which had so excited Fagin's cupidity, to the\r\n",
      "banker's; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house,\r\n",
      "they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took\r\n",
      "Oliver with them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Who can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft\r\n",
      "tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green\r\n",
      "hills and rich woods, of an inland village!  Who can tell how scenes of\r\n",
      "peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain-worn dwellers in close\r\n",
      "and noisy places, and carry their own freshness, deep into their jaded\r\n",
      "hearts!  Men who have lived in crowded, pent-up streets, through lives\r\n",
      "of toil, and who have never wished for change; men, to whom custom has\r\n",
      "indeed been second nature, and who have come almost to love each brick\r\n",
      "and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks; even\r\n",
      "they, with the hand of death upon them, have been known to yearn at\r\n",
      "last for one short glimpse of Nature's face; and, carried far from the\r\n",
      "scenes of their old pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once\r\n",
      "into a new state of being.  Crawling forth, from day to day, to some\r\n",
      "green sunny spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by\r\n",
      "the sight of the sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a\r\n",
      "foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline, and they\r\n",
      "have sunk into their tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they\r\n",
      "watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded\r\n",
      "from their dim and feeble sight!  The memories which peaceful country\r\n",
      "scenes call up, are not of this world, nor of its thoughts and hopes.\r\n",
      "Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the\r\n",
      "graves of those we loved:  may purify our thoughts, and bear down\r\n",
      "before it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this, there lingers,\r\n",
      "in the least reflective mind, a vague and half-formed consciousness of\r\n",
      "having held such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time,\r\n",
      "which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down\r\n",
      "pride and worldliness beneath it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a lovely spot to which they repaired.  Oliver, whose days had\r\n",
      "been spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and\r\n",
      "brawling, seemed to enter on a new existence there.  The rose and\r\n",
      "honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls; the ivy crept round the trunks\r\n",
      "of the trees; and the garden-flowers perfumed the air with delicious\r\n",
      "odours.  Hard by, was a little churchyard; not crowded with tall\r\n",
      "unsightly gravestones, but full of humble mounds, covered with fresh\r\n",
      "turf and moss: beneath which, the old people of the village lay at\r\n",
      "rest.  Oliver often wandered here; and, thinking of the wretched grave\r\n",
      "in which his mother lay, would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen;\r\n",
      "but, when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead, he would cease\r\n",
      "to think of her as lying in the ground, and would weep for her, sadly,\r\n",
      "but without pain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a happy time.  The days were peaceful and serene; the nights\r\n",
      "brought with them neither fear nor care; no languishing in a wretched\r\n",
      "prison, or associating with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and\r\n",
      "happy thoughts.  Every morning he went to a white-headed old gentleman,\r\n",
      "who lived near the little church: who taught him to read better, and to\r\n",
      "write:  and who spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that Oliver could\r\n",
      "never try enough to please him.  Then, he would walk with Mrs. Maylie\r\n",
      "and Rose, and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in\r\n",
      "some shady place, and listen whilst the young lady read: which he could\r\n",
      "have done, until it grew too dark to see the letters. Then, he had his\r\n",
      "own lesson for the next day to prepare; and at this, he would work\r\n",
      "hard, in a little room which looked into the garden, till evening came\r\n",
      "slowly on, when the ladies would walk out again, and he with them:\r\n",
      "listening with such pleasure to all they said:  and so happy if they\r\n",
      "wanted a flower that he could climb to reach, or had forgotten anything\r\n",
      "he could run to fetch: that he could never be quick enough about it.\r\n",
      "When it became quite dark, and they returned home, the young lady would\r\n",
      "sit down to the piano, and play some pleasant air, or sing, in a low\r\n",
      "and gentle voice, some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear.\r\n",
      "There would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and Oliver\r\n",
      "would sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a\r\n",
      "perfect rapture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any way\r\n",
      "in which he had ever spent it yet! and how happily too; like all the\r\n",
      "other days in that most happy time!  There was the little church, in\r\n",
      "the morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the windows:  the\r\n",
      "birds singing without:  and the sweet-smelling air stealing in at the\r\n",
      "low porch, and filling the homely building with its fragrance. The poor\r\n",
      "people were so neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that\r\n",
      "it seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there\r\n",
      "together; and though the singing might be rude, it was real, and\r\n",
      "sounded more musical (to Oliver's ears at least) than any he had ever\r\n",
      "heard in church before.  Then, there were the walks as usual, and many\r\n",
      "calls at the clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, Oliver\r\n",
      "read a chapter or two from the Bible, which he had been studying all\r\n",
      "the week, and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and\r\n",
      "pleased, than if he had been the clergyman himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the morning, Oliver would be a-foot by six o'clock, roaming the\r\n",
      "fields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild\r\n",
      "flowers, with which he would return laden, home; and which it took\r\n",
      "great care and consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the\r\n",
      "embellishment of the breakfast-table. There was fresh groundsel, too,\r\n",
      "for Miss Maylie's birds, with which Oliver, who had been studying the\r\n",
      "subject under the able tuition of the village clerk, would decorate the\r\n",
      "cages, in the most approved taste. When the birds were made all spruce\r\n",
      "and smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of\r\n",
      "charity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was rare\r\n",
      "cricket-playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that, there was\r\n",
      "always something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which\r\n",
      "Oliver (who had studied this science also, under the same master, who\r\n",
      "was a gardener by trade,) applied himself with hearty good-will, until\r\n",
      "Miss Rose made her appearance:  when there were a thousand\r\n",
      "commendations to be bestowed on all he had done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the\r\n",
      "most blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled\r\n",
      "happiness, and which, in Oliver's were true felicity. With the purest\r\n",
      "and most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest,\r\n",
      "soul-felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of\r\n",
      "that short time, Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with\r\n",
      "the old lady and her niece, and that the fervent attachment of his\r\n",
      "young and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride in, and attachment\r\n",
      "to, himself.\r\n",

      "Spring flew swiftly by, and summer came.  If the village had been\r\n",
      "beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its\r\n",
      "richness.  The great trees, which had looked shrunken and bare in the\r\n",
      "earlier months, had now burst into strong life and health; and\r\n",
      "stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground, converted\r\n",
      "open and naked spots into choice nooks, where was a deep and pleasant\r\n",
      "shade from which to look upon the wide prospect, steeped in sunshine,\r\n",
      "which lay stretched beyond.  The earth had donned her mantle of\r\n",
      "brightest green; and shed her richest perfumes abroad.  It was the\r\n",
      "prime and vigour of the year; all things were glad and flourishing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same\r\n",
      "cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates.  Oliver had long since\r\n",
      "grown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in\r\n",
      "his warm feelings of a great many people.  He was still the same\r\n",
      "gentle, attached, affectionate creature that he had been when pain and\r\n",
      "suffering had wasted his strength, and when he was dependent for every\r\n",
      "slight attention, and comfort on those who tended him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was\r\n",
      "customary with them:  for the day had been unusually warm, and there\r\n",
      "was a brilliant moon, and a light wind had sprung up, which was\r\n",
      "unusually refreshing.  Rose had been in high spirits, too, and they had\r\n",
      "walked on, in merry conversation, until they had far exceeded their\r\n",
      "ordinary bounds.  Mrs. Maylie being fatigued, they returned more slowly\r\n",
      "home.  The young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet, sat down\r\n",
      "to the piano as usual.  After running abstractedly over the keys for a\r\n",
      "few minutes, she fell into a low and very solemn air; and as she played\r\n",
      "it, they heard a sound as if she were weeping.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Rose, my dear!' said the elder lady.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words\r\n",
      "had roused her from some painful thoughts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Rose, my love!' cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and bending over\r\n",
      "her.  'What is this?  In tears!  My dear child, what distresses you?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing, aunt; nothing,' replied the young lady.  'I don't know what\r\n",
      "it is; I can't describe it; but I feel--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not ill, my love?' interposed Mrs. Maylie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no!  Oh, not ill!' replied Rose: shuddering as though some deadly\r\n",
      "chillness were passing over her, while she spoke; 'I shall be better\r\n",
      "presently.  Close the window, pray!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver hastened to comply with her request.  The young lady, making an\r\n",
      "effort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune;\r\n",
      "but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys. Covering her face with\r\n",
      "her hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears which she\r\n",
      "was now unable to repress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'My child!' said the elderly lady, folding her arms about her, 'I never\r\n",
      "saw you so before.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I would not alarm you if I could avoid it,' rejoined Rose; 'but indeed\r\n",
      "I have tried very hard, and cannot help this. I fear I _am_ ill, aunt.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in the\r\n",
      "very short time which had elapsed since their return home, the hue of\r\n",
      "her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness. Its expression had\r\n",
      "lost nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an\r\n",
      "anxious haggard look about the gentle face, which it had never worn\r\n",
      "before.  Another minute, and it was suffused with a crimson flush:  and\r\n",
      "a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye.  Again this disappeared,\r\n",
      "like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she was once more deadly\r\n",
      "pale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was\r\n",
      "alarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that\r\n",
      "she affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the same, and\r\n",
      "they so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to\r\n",
      "retire for the night, she was in better spirits; and appeared even in\r\n",
      "better health:  assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in\r\n",
      "the morning, quite well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I hope,' said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, 'that nothing is the\r\n",
      "matter?  She don't look well to-night, but--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old lady motioned to him not to speak; and sitting herself down in\r\n",
      "a dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time. At length,\r\n",
      "she said, in a trembling voice:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I hope not, Oliver.  I have been very happy with her for some years:\r\n",
      "too happy, perhaps.  It may be time that I should meet with some\r\n",
      "misfortune; but I hope it is not this.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What?' inquired Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The heavy blow,' said the old lady, 'of losing the dear girl who has\r\n",
      "so long been my comfort and happiness.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh!  God forbid!' exclaimed Oliver, hastily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Amen to that, my child!' said the old lady, wringing her hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?' said Oliver. 'Two\r\n",
      "hours ago, she was quite well.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She is very ill now,' rejoined Mrs. Maylies; 'and will be worse, I am\r\n",
      "sure.  My dear, dear Rose!  Oh, what shall I do without her!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his own\r\n",
      "emotion, ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg, earnestly, that,\r\n",
      "for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she would be more calm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And consider, ma'am,' said Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into\r\n",
      "his eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary. 'Oh! consider how\r\n",
      "young and good she is, and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all\r\n",
      "about her.  I am sure--certain--quite certain--that, for your sake, who\r\n",
      "are so good yourself; and for her own; and for the sake of all she\r\n",
      "makes so happy; she will not die.  Heaven will never let her die so\r\n",
      "young.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hush!' said Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand on Oliver's head. 'You think\r\n",
      "like a child, poor boy.  But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding.  I\r\n",
      "had forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned,\r\n",
      "for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the\r\n",
      "agony of separation from the objects of our love.  I have seen enough,\r\n",
      "too, to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared\r\n",
      "to those that love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow;\r\n",
      "for Heaven is just; and such things teach us, impressively, that there\r\n",
      "is a brighter world than this; and that the passage to it is speedy.\r\n",
      "God's will be done!  I love her; and He knows how well!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she\r\n",
      "checked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself\r\n",
      "up as she spoke, became composed and firm.  He was still more\r\n",
      "astonished to find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all the\r\n",
      "care and watching which ensued, Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and\r\n",
      "collected: performing all the duties which had devolved upon her,\r\n",
      "steadily, and, to all external appearances, even cheerfully.  But he\r\n",
      "was young, and did not know what strong minds are capable of, under\r\n",
      "trying circumstances.  How should he, when their possessors so seldom\r\n",
      "know themselves?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An anxious night ensued.  When morning came, Mrs. Maylie's predictions\r\n",
      "were but too well verified.  Rose was in the first stage of a high and\r\n",
      "dangerous fever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,' said\r\n",
      "Mrs. Maylie, laying her finger on her lip, as she looked steadily into\r\n",
      "his face; 'this letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to\r\n",
      "Mr. Losberne.  It must be carried to the market-town: which is not more\r\n",
      "than four miles off, by the footpath across the field:  and thence\r\n",
      "dispatched, by an express on horseback, straight to Chertsey. The\r\n",
      "people at the inn will undertake to do this: and I can trust to you to\r\n",
      "see it done, I know.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver could make no reply, but looked his anxiety to be gone at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Here is another letter,' said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect; 'but\r\n",
      "whether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I\r\n",
      "scarcely know.  I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is it for Chertsey, too, ma'am?' inquired Oliver; impatient to execute\r\n",
      "his commission, and holding out his trembling hand for the letter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' replied the old lady, giving it to him mechanically. Oliver\r\n",
      "glanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire,\r\n",
      "at some great lord's house in the country; where, he could not make out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Shall it go, ma'am?' asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I think not,' replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it back.  'I will wait until\r\n",
      "to-morrow.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words, she gave Oliver her purse, and he started off,\r\n",
      "without more delay, at the greatest speed he could muster.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Swiftly he ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which\r\n",
      "sometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either\r\n",
      "side, and now emerging on an open field, where the mowers and haymakers\r\n",
      "were busy at their work:  nor did he stop once, save now and then, for\r\n",
      "a few seconds, to recover breath, until he came, in a great heat, and\r\n",
      "covered with dust, on the little market-place of the market-town.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here he paused, and looked about for the inn.  There were a white bank,\r\n",
      "and a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one corner there was\r\n",
      "a large house, with all the wood about it painted green:  before which\r\n",
      "was the sign of 'The George.'  To this he hastened, as soon as it\r\n",
      "caught his eye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after\r\n",
      "hearing what he wanted, referred him to the ostler; who after hearing\r\n",
      "all he had to say again, referred him to the landlord; who was a tall\r\n",
      "gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots\r\n",
      "with tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable-door, picking\r\n",
      "his teeth with a silver toothpick.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out\r\n",
      "the bill:  which took a long time making out:  and after it was ready,\r\n",
      "and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed, which\r\n",
      "took up ten good minutes more.  Meanwhile Oliver was in such a\r\n",
      "desperate state of impatience and anxiety, that he felt as if he could\r\n",
      "have jumped upon the horse himself, and galloped away, full tear, to\r\n",
      "the next stage.  At length, all was ready; and the little parcel having\r\n",
      "been handed up, with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy\r\n",
      "delivery, the man set spurs to his horse, and rattling over the uneven\r\n",
      "paving of the market-place, was out of the town, and galloping along\r\n",
      "the turnpike-road, in a couple of minutes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and\r\n",
      "that no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn-yard, with a\r\n",
      "somewhat lighter heart.  He was turning out of the gateway when he\r\n",
      "accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at\r\n",
      "that moment coming out of the inn door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hah!' cried the man, fixing his eyes on Oliver, and suddenly\r\n",
      "recoiling.  'What the devil's this?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I beg your pardon, sir,' said Oliver; 'I was in a great hurry to get\r\n",
      "home, and didn't see you were coming.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Death!' muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his large\r\n",
      "dark eyes.  'Who would have thought it! Grind him to ashes! He'd start\r\n",
      "up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I am sorry,' stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man's wild\r\n",
      "look.  'I hope I have not hurt you!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Rot you!' murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his\r\n",
      "clenched teeth; 'if I had only had the courage to say the word, I might\r\n",
      "have been free of you in a night.  Curses on your head, and black death\r\n",
      "on your heart, you imp!  What are you doing here?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently. He\r\n",
      "advanced towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at\r\n",
      "him, but fell violently on the ground:  writhing and foaming, in a fit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman (for such he\r\n",
      "supposed him to be); and then darted into the house for help.  Having\r\n",
      "seen him safely carried into the hotel, he turned his face homewards,\r\n",
      "running as fast as he could, to make up for lost time:  and recalling\r\n",
      "with a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary\r\n",
      "behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however: for\r\n",
      "when he reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his mind, and\r\n",
      "to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid-night she was\r\n",
      "delirious.  A medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in\r\n",
      "constant attendance upon her; and after first seeing the patient, he\r\n",
      "had taken Mrs. Maylie aside, and pronounced her disorder to be one of a\r\n",
      "most alarming nature. 'In fact,' he said, 'it would be little short of\r\n",
      "a miracle, if she recovered.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How often did Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing out,\r\n",
      "with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest\r\n",
      "sound from the sick chamber!  How often did a tremble shake his frame,\r\n",
      "and cold drops of terror start upon his brow, when a sudden trampling\r\n",
      "of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of, had\r\n",
      "even then occurred!  And what had been the fervency of all the prayers\r\n",
      "he had ever muttered, compared with those he poured forth, now, in the\r\n",
      "agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the\r\n",
      "gentle creature, who was tottering on the deep grave's verge!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh! the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by\r\n",
      "while the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance!  Oh!\r\n",
      "the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat\r\n",
      "violently, and the breath come thick, by the force of the images they\r\n",
      "conjure up before it; the desperate anxiety _to be doing something_ to\r\n",
      "relieve the pain, or lessen the danger, which we have no power to\r\n",
      "alleviate; the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad remembrance of\r\n",
      "our helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what\r\n",
      "reflections or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time,\r\n",
      "allay them!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Morning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still. People spoke\r\n",
      "in whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time;\r\n",
      "women and children went away in tears. All the livelong day, and for\r\n",
      "hours after it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the\r\n",
      "garden, raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and\r\n",
      "shuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay\r\n",
      "stretched inside.  Late that night, Mr. Losberne arrived.  'It is\r\n",
      "hard,' said the good doctor, turning away as he spoke; 'so young; so\r\n",
      "much beloved; but there is very little hope.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another morning.  The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked\r\n",
      "upon no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom\r\n",
      "about her; with life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy,\r\n",
      "surrounding her on every side: the fair young creature lay, wasting\r\n",
      "fast.  Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one\r\n",
      "of the green mounds, wept and prayed for her, in silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and\r\n",
      "mirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the\r\n",
      "summer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering\r\n",
      "overhead; so much of life and joyousness in all; that, when the boy\r\n",
      "raised his aching eyes, and looked about, the thought instinctively\r\n",
      "occurred to him, that this was not a time for death; that Rose could\r\n",
      "surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that\r\n",
      "graves were for cold and cheerless winter:  not for sunlight and\r\n",
      "fragrance. He almost thought that shrouds were for the old and\r\n",
      "shrunken; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in\r\n",
      "their ghastly folds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts.\r\n",
      "Another!  Again!  It was tolling for the funeral service.  A group of\r\n",
      "humble mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse\r\n",
      "was young.  They stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother--a\r\n",
      "mother once--among the weeping train.  But the sun shone brightly, and\r\n",
      "the birds sang on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had received\r\n",
      "from the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that\r\n",
      "he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was.  He\r\n",
      "had no cause for self-reproach on the score of neglect, or want of\r\n",
      "thought, for he had been devoted to her service; and yet a hundred\r\n",
      "little occasions rose up before him, on which he fancied he might have\r\n",
      "been more zealous, and more earnest, and wished he had been.  We need\r\n",
      "be careful how we deal with those about us, when every death carries to\r\n",
      "some small circle of survivors, thoughts of so much omitted, and so\r\n",
      "little done--of so many things forgotten, and so many more which might\r\n",
      "have been repaired!  There is no remorse so deep as that which is\r\n",
      "unavailing; if we would be spared its tortures, let us remember this,\r\n",
      "in time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour.\r\n",
      "Oliver's heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside\r\n",
      "of her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven\r\n",
      "her away.  He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep, from which\r\n",
      "she would waken, either to recovery and life, or to bid them farewell,\r\n",
      "and die.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours.  The untasted meal\r\n",
      "was removed, with looks which showed that their thoughts were\r\n",
      "elsewhere, they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower, and, at\r\n",
      "length, cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his\r\n",
      "departure.  Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching\r\n",
      "footstep.  They both involuntarily darted to the door, as Mr. Losberne\r\n",
      "entered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What of Rose?' cried the old lady.  'Tell me at once!  I can bear it;\r\n",
      "anything but suspense!  Oh, tell me! in the name of Heaven!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You must compose yourself,' said the doctor supporting her. 'Be calm,\r\n",
      "my dear ma'am, pray.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Let me go, in God's name!  My dear child!  She is dead! She is dying!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No!' cried the doctor, passionately.  'As He is good and merciful, she\r\n",
      "will live to bless us all, for years to come.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lady fell upon her knees, and tried to fold her hands together; but\r\n",
      "the energy which had supported her so long, fled up to Heaven with her\r\n",
      "first thanksgiving; and she sank into the friendly arms which were\r\n",
      "extended to receive her.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN\r\n",
      "WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO\r\n",
      "OLIVER\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was almost too much happiness to bear.  Oliver felt stunned and\r\n",
      "stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak,\r\n",
      "or rest.  He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had\r\n",
      "passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of\r\n",
      "tears came to his relief, and he seemed to awaken, all at once, to a\r\n",
      "full sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost\r\n",
      "insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The night was fast closing in, when he returned homeward:  laden with\r\n",
      "flowers which he had culled, with peculiar care, for the adornment of\r\n",
      "the sick chamber.  As he walked briskly along the road, he heard behind\r\n",
      "him, the noise of some vehicle, approaching at a furious pace.  Looking\r\n",
      "round, he saw that it was a post-chaise, driven at great speed; and as\r\n",
      "the horses were galloping, and the road was narrow, he stood leaning\r\n",
      "against a gate until it should have passed him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap,\r\n",
      "whose face seemed familiar to him, although his view was so brief that\r\n",
      "he could not identify the person.  In another second or two, the\r\n",
      "nightcap was thrust out of the chaise-window, and a stentorian voice\r\n",
      "bellowed to the driver to stop:  which he did, as soon as he could pull\r\n",
      "up his horses.  Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same\r\n",
      "voice called Oliver by his name.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Here!' cried the voice.  'Oliver, what's the news?  Miss Rose! Master\r\n",
      "O-li-ver!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is it you, Giles?' cried Oliver, running up to the chaise-door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Giles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply,\r\n",
      "when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the\r\n",
      "other corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'In a word!' cried the gentleman, 'Better or worse?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Better--much better!' replied Oliver, hastily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Thank Heaven!' exclaimed the gentleman.  'You are sure?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Quite, sir,' replied Oliver.  'The change took place only a few hours\r\n",
      "ago; and Mr. Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise-door,\r\n",
      "leaped out, and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him aside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You are quite certain?  There is no possibility of any mistake on your\r\n",
      "part, my boy, is there?' demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice.\r\n",
      "'Do not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I would not for the world, sir,' replied Oliver.  'Indeed you may\r\n",
      "believe me.  Mr. Losberne's words were, that she would live to bless us\r\n",
      "all for many years to come.  I heard him say so.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tears stood in Oliver's eyes as he recalled the scene which was the\r\n",
      "beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away,\r\n",
      "and remained silent, for some minutes.  Oliver thought he heard him\r\n",
      "sob, more than once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh\r\n",
      "remark--for he could well guess what his feelings were--and so stood\r\n",
      "apart, feigning to be occupied with his nosegay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting\r\n",
      "on the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and\r\n",
      "wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with\r\n",
      "white spots.  That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion, was\r\n",
      "abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the\r\n",
      "young gentleman, when he turned round and addressed him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I think you had better go on to my mother's in the chaise, Giles,'\r\n",
      "said he.  'I would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time\r\n",
      "before I see her.  You can say I am coming.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I beg your pardon, Mr. Harry,' said Giles:  giving a final polish to\r\n",
      "his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief; 'but if you would leave\r\n",
      "the postboy to say that, I should be very much obliged to you.  It\r\n",
      "wouldn't be proper for the maids to see me in this state, sir; I should\r\n",
      "never have any more authority with them if they did.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well,' rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling, 'you can do as you like. Let\r\n",
      "him go on with the luggage, if you wish it, and do you follow with us.\r\n",
      "Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering,\r\n",
      "or we shall be taken for madmen.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Giles, reminded of his unbecoming costume, snatched off and\r\n",
      "pocketed his nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape,\r\n",
      "which he took out of the chaise.  This done, the postboy drove off;\r\n",
      "Giles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their leisure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much\r\n",
      "interest and curiosity at the new comer.  He seemed about\r\n",
      "five-and-twenty years of age, and was of the middle height; his\r\n",
      "countenance was frank and handsome; and his demeanor easy and\r\n",
      "prepossessing.  Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age,\r\n",
      "he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that Oliver would have\r\n",
      "had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he had not\r\n",
      "already spoken of her as his mother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached\r\n",
      "the cottage.  The meeting did not take place without great emotion on\r\n",
      "both sides.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mother!' whispered the young man; 'why did you not write before?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I did,' replied Mrs. Maylie; 'but, on reflection, I determined to keep\r\n",
      "back the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne's opinion.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'But why,' said the young man, 'why run the chance of that occurring\r\n",
      "which so nearly happened?  If Rose had--I cannot utter that word\r\n",
      "now--if this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever\r\n",
      "have forgiven yourself!  How could I ever have know happiness again!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If that _had_ been the case, Harry,' said Mrs. Maylie, 'I fear your\r\n",
      "happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that your arrival\r\n",
      "here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very little\r\n",
      "import.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And who can wonder if it be so, mother?' rejoined the young man; 'or\r\n",
      "why should I say, _if_?--It is--it is--you know it, mother--you must\r\n",
      "know it!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can\r\n",
      "offer,' said Mrs. Maylie; 'I know that the devotion and affection of\r\n",
      "her nature require no ordinary return, but one that shall be deep and\r\n",
      "lasting.  If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed\r\n",
      "behaviour in one she loved would break her heart, I should not feel my\r\n",
      "task so difficult of performance, or have to encounter so many\r\n",
      "struggles in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the\r\n",
      "strict line of duty.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This is unkind, mother,' said Harry.  'Do you still suppose that I am\r\n",
      "a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own\r\n",
      "soul?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I think, my dear son,' returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand upon his\r\n",
      "shoulder, 'that youth has many generous impulses which do not last; and\r\n",
      "that among them are some, which, being gratified, become only the more\r\n",
      "fleeting.  Above all, I think' said the lady, fixing her eyes on her\r\n",
      "son's face, 'that if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a\r\n",
      "wife on whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no\r\n",
      "fault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and\r\n",
      "upon his children also: and, in exact proportion to his success in the\r\n",
      "world, be cast in his teeth, and made the subject of sneers against\r\n",
      "him:  he may, no matter how generous and good his nature, one day\r\n",
      "repent of the connection he formed in early life.  And she may have the\r\n",
      "pain of knowing that he does so.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mother,' said the young man, impatiently, 'he would be a selfish\r\n",
      "brute, unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe,\r\n",
      "who acted thus.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You think so now, Harry,' replied his mother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And ever will!' said the young man.  'The mental agony I have\r\n",
      "suffered, during the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to you of\r\n",
      "a passion which, as you well know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I\r\n",
      "have lightly formed.  On Rose, sweet, gentle girl! my heart is set, as\r\n",
      "firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman.  I have no thought, no\r\n",
      "view, no hope in life, beyond her; and if you oppose me in this great\r\n",
      "stake, you take my peace and happiness in your hands, and cast them to\r\n",
      "the wind.  Mother, think better of this, and of me, and do not\r\n",
      "disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Harry,' said Mrs. Maylie, 'it is because I think so much of warm and\r\n",
      "sensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded. But we\r\n",
      "have said enough, and more than enough, on this matter, just now.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Let it rest with Rose, then,' interposed Harry.  'You will not press\r\n",
      "these overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw any obstacle\r\n",
      "in my way?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I will not,' rejoined Mrs. Maylie; 'but I would have you consider--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I _have_ considered!' was the impatient reply; 'Mother, I have\r\n",
      "considered, years and years.  I have considered, ever since I have been\r\n",
      "capable of serious reflection.  My feelings remain unchanged, as they\r\n",
      "ever will; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them\r\n",
      "vent, which can be productive of no earthly good?  No!  Before I leave\r\n",
      "this place, Rose shall hear me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She shall,' said Mrs. Maylie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she\r\n",
      "will hear me coldly, mother,' said the young man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not coldly,' rejoined the old lady; 'far from it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'How then?' urged the young man.  'She has formed no other attachment?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, indeed,' replied his mother; 'you have, or I mistake, too strong a\r\n",
      "hold on her affections already.  What I would say,' resumed the old\r\n",
      "lady, stopping her son as he was about to speak, 'is this.  Before you\r\n",
      "stake your all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried\r\n",
      "to the highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child,\r\n",
      "on Rose's history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her\r\n",
      "doubtful birth may have on her decision:  devoted as she is to us, with\r\n",
      "all the intensity of her noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of\r\n",
      "self which, in all matters, great or trifling, has always been her\r\n",
      "characteristic.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What do you mean?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That I leave you to discover,' replied Mrs. Maylie.  'I must go back\r\n",
      "to her.  God bless you!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I shall see you again to-night?' said the young man, eagerly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'By and by,' replied the lady; 'when I leave Rose.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You will tell her I am here?' said Harry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Of course,' replied Mrs. Maylie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And say how anxious I have been, and how much I have suffered, and how\r\n",
      "I long to see her.  You will not refuse to do this, mother?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' said the old lady; 'I will tell her all.'  And pressing her son's\r\n",
      "hand, affectionately, she hastened from the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment\r\n",
      "while this hurried conversation was proceeding.  The former now held\r\n",
      "out his hand to Harry Maylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged\r\n",
      "between them.  The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious\r\n",
      "questions from his young friend, a precise account of his patient's\r\n",
      "situation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as\r\n",
      "Oliver's statement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of\r\n",
      "which, Mr. Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened\r\n",
      "with greedy ears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Have you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?' inquired the\r\n",
      "doctor, when he had concluded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing particular, sir,' replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nor catching any thieves, nor identifying any house-breakers?' said\r\n",
      "the doctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'None at all, sir,' replied Mr. Giles, with much gravity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well,' said the doctor, 'I am sorry to hear it, because you do that\r\n",
      "sort of thing admirably.  Pray, how is Brittles?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The boy is very well, sir,' said Mr. Giles, recovering his usual tone\r\n",
      "of patronage; 'and sends his respectful duty, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's well,' said the doctor.  'Seeing you here, reminds me, Mr.\r\n",
      "Giles, that on the day before that on which I was called away so\r\n",
      "hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small\r\n",
      "commission in your favour.  Just step into this corner a moment, will\r\n",
      "you?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder,\r\n",
      "and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on\r\n",
      "the termination of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with\r\n",
      "steps of unusual stateliness.  The subject matter of this conference\r\n",
      "was not disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily\r\n",
      "enlightened concerning it; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither, and\r\n",
      "having called for a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty,\r\n",
      "which was highly effective, that it had pleased his mistress, in\r\n",
      "consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that\r\n",
      "attempted robbery, to deposit, in the local savings-bank, the sum of\r\n",
      "five-and-twenty pounds, for his sole use and benefit.  At this, the two\r\n",
      "women-servants lifted up their hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr.\r\n",
      "Giles, pulling out his shirt-frill, replied, 'No, no'; and that if they\r\n",
      "observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors, he would thank\r\n",
      "them to tell him so.  And then he made a great many other remarks, no\r\n",
      "less illustrative of his humility, which were received with equal\r\n",
      "favour and applause, and were, withal, as original and as much to the\r\n",
      "purpose, as the remarks of great men commonly are.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Above stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for\r\n",
      "the doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful\r\n",
      "Harry Maylie might have been at first, he was not proof against the\r\n",
      "worthy gentleman's good humour, which displayed itself in a great\r\n",
      "variety of sallies and professional recollections, and an abundance of\r\n",
      "small jokes, which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had\r\n",
      "ever heard, and caused him to laugh proportionately; to the evident\r\n",
      "satisfaction of the doctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and\r\n",
      "made Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very force of sympathy.\r\n",
      "So, they were as pleasant a party as, under the circumstances, they\r\n",
      "could well have been; and it was late before they retired, with light\r\n",
      "and thankful hearts, to take that rest of which, after the doubt and\r\n",
      "suspense they had recently undergone, they stood much in need.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual\r\n",
      "occupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many\r\n",
      "days.  The birds were once more hung out, to sing, in their old places;\r\n",
      "and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found, were once more\r\n",
      "gathered to gladden Rose with their beauty. The melancholy which had\r\n",
      "seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang, for days past, over\r\n",
      "every object, beautiful as all were, was dispelled by magic.  The dew\r\n",
      "seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle\r\n",
      "among them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue\r\n",
      "and bright. Such is the influence which the condition of our own\r\n",
      "thoughts, exercise, even over the appearance of external objects.  Men\r\n",
      "who look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and\r\n",
      "gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from\r\n",
      "their own jaundiced eyes and hearts.  The real hues are delicate, and\r\n",
      "need a clearer vision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time,\r\n",
      "that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone. Harry Maylie,\r\n",
      "after the very first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home, was\r\n",
      "seized with such a passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in\r\n",
      "their arrangement, as left his young companion far behind.  If Oliver\r\n",
      "were behindhand in these respects, he knew where the best were to be\r\n",
      "found; and morning after morning they scoured the country together, and\r\n",
      "brought home the fairest that blossomed.  The window of the young\r\n",
      "lady's chamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer\r\n",
      "air stream in, and revive her with its freshness; but there always\r\n",
      "stood in water, just inside the lattice, one particular little bunch,\r\n",
      "which was made up with great care, every morning.  Oliver could not\r\n",
      "help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away,\r\n",
      "although the little vase was regularly replenished; nor, could he help\r\n",
      "observing, that whenever the doctor came into the garden, he invariably\r\n",
      "cast his eyes up to that particular corner, and nodded his head most\r\n",
      "expressively, as he set forth on his morning's walk.  Pending these\r\n",
      "observations, the days were flying by; and Rose was rapidly recovering.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor did Oliver's time hang heavy on his hands, although the young lady\r\n",
      "had not yet left her chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now\r\n",
      "and then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie. He applied himself,\r\n",
      "with redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white-headed old\r\n",
      "gentleman, and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even\r\n",
      "himself.  It was while he was engaged in this pursuit, that he was\r\n",
      "greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The little room in which he was accustomed to sit, when busy at his\r\n",
      "books, was on the ground-floor, at the back of the house.  It was quite\r\n",
      "a cottage-room, with a lattice-window: around which were clusters of\r\n",
      "jessamine and honeysuckle, that crept over the casement, and filled the\r\n",
      "place with their delicious perfume.  It looked into a garden, whence a\r\n",
      "wicket-gate opened into a small paddock; all beyond, was fine\r\n",
      "meadow-land and wood.  There was no other dwelling near, in that\r\n",
      "direction; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning\r\n",
      "to settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his\r\n",
      "books.  He had been poring over them for some time; and, as the day had\r\n",
      "been uncommonly sultry, and he had exerted himself a great deal, it is\r\n",
      "no disparagement to the authors, whoever they may have been, to say,\r\n",
      "that gradually and by slow degrees, he fell asleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while it\r\n",
      "holds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of things\r\n",
      "about it, and enable it to ramble at its pleasure.  So far as an\r\n",
      "overpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter\r\n",
      "inability to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called\r\n",
      "sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is\r\n",
      "going on about us, and, if we dream at such a time, words which are\r\n",
      "really spoken, or sounds which really exist at the moment, accommodate\r\n",
      "themselves with surprising readiness to our visions, until reality and\r\n",
      "imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost\r\n",
      "matter of impossibility to separate the two.  Nor is this, the most\r\n",
      "striking phenomenon incidental to such a state.  It is an undoubted\r\n",
      "fact, that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead,\r\n",
      "yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before\r\n",
      "us, will be influenced and materially influenced, by the _mere silent\r\n",
      "presence_ of some external object; which may not have been near us when\r\n",
      "we closed our eyes:  and of whose vicinity we have had no waking\r\n",
      "consciousness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that\r\n",
      "his books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was\r\n",
      "stirring among the creeping plants outside.  And yet he was asleep.\r\n",
      "Suddenly, the scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he\r\n",
      "thought, with a glow of terror, that he was in the Jew's house again.\r\n",
      "There sat the hideous old man, in his accustomed corner, pointing at\r\n",
      "him, and whispering to another man, with his face averted, who sat\r\n",
      "beside him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hush, my dear!' he thought he heard the Jew say; 'it is he, sure\r\n",
      "enough.  Come away.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He!' the other man seemed to answer; 'could I mistake him, think you?\r\n",
      "If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape, and\r\n",
      "he stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to\r\n",
      "point him out.  If you buried him fifty feet deep, and took me across\r\n",
      "his grave, I fancy I should know, if there wasn't a mark above it, that\r\n",
      "he lay buried there?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that Oliver\r\n",
      "awoke with the fear, and started up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Good Heaven!  what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his\r\n",
      "heart, and deprived him of his voice, and of power to move!\r\n",
      "There--there--at the window--close before him--so close, that he could\r\n",
      "have almost touched him before he started back:  with his eyes peering\r\n",
      "into the room, and meeting his:  there stood the Jew!  And beside him,\r\n",
      "white with rage or fear, or both, were the scowling features of the man\r\n",
      "who had accosted him in the inn-yard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before his eyes; and they\r\n",
      "were gone.  But they had recognised him, and he them; and their look\r\n",
      "was as firmly impressed upon his memory, as if it had been deeply\r\n",
      "carved in stone, and set before him from his birth. He stood transfixed\r\n",
      "for a moment; then, leaping from the window into the garden, called\r\n",
      "loudly for help.\r\n",

      "CHAPTER XXXV\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "CONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER'S ADVENTURE; AND A\r\n",
      "CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver's cries, hurried to\r\n",
      "the spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated,\r\n",
      "pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely\r\n",
      "able to articulate the words, 'The Jew! the Jew!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry\r\n",
      "Maylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard\r\n",
      "Oliver's history from his mother, understood it at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What direction did he take?' he asked, catching up a heavy stick which\r\n",
      "was standing in a corner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That,' replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; 'I\r\n",
      "missed them in an instant.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then, they are in the ditch!' said Harry.  'Follow!  And keep as near\r\n",
      "me, as you can.' So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted off\r\n",
      "with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the\r\n",
      "others to keep near him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Giles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and in the\r\n",
      "course of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and\r\n",
      "just then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking\r\n",
      "himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to\r\n",
      "possess, struck into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting\r\n",
      "all the while, most prodigiously, to know what was the matter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the leader,\r\n",
      "striking off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver, began to\r\n",
      "search, narrowly, the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time\r\n",
      "for the remainder of the party to come up; and for Oliver to\r\n",
      "communicate to Mr. Losberne the circumstances that had led to so\r\n",
      "vigorous a pursuit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The search was all in vain.  There were not even the traces of recent\r\n",
      "footsteps, to be seen.  They stood now, on the summit of a little hill,\r\n",
      "commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles.\r\n",
      "There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain\r\n",
      "that, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must\r\n",
      "have made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could\r\n",
      "have accomplished in so short a time.  A thick wood skirted the\r\n",
      "meadow-land in another direction; but they could not have gained that\r\n",
      "covert for the same reason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It must have been a dream, Oliver,' said Harry Maylie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh no, indeed, sir,' replied Oliver, shuddering at the very\r\n",
      "recollection of the old wretch's countenance; 'I saw him too plainly\r\n",
      "for that.  I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Who was the other?' inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne, together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the\r\n",
      "inn,' said Oliver.  'We had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I\r\n",
      "could swear to him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'They took this way?' demanded Harry:  'are you sure?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'As I am that the men were at the window,' replied Oliver, pointing\r\n",
      "down, as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage-garden from\r\n",
      "the meadow.  'The tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew,\r\n",
      "running a few paces to the right, crept through that gap.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two gentlemen watched Oliver's earnest face, as he spoke, and\r\n",
      "looking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the\r\n",
      "accuracy of what he said.  Still, in no direction were there any\r\n",
      "appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight.  The grass was\r\n",
      "long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own feet had\r\n",
      "crushed it.  The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but\r\n",
      "in no one place could they discern the print of men's shoes, or the\r\n",
      "slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the\r\n",
      "ground for hours before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This is strange!' said Harry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Strange?' echoed the doctor.  'Blathers and Duff, themselves, could\r\n",
      "make nothing of it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did\r\n",
      "not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further\r\n",
      "prosecution hopeless; and even then, they gave it up with reluctance.\r\n",
      "Giles was dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village,\r\n",
      "furnished with the best description Oliver could give of the appearance\r\n",
      "and dress of the strangers.  Of these, the Jew was, at all events,\r\n",
      "sufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he had been seen\r\n",
      "drinking, or loitering about; but Giles returned without any\r\n",
      "intelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries renewed; but\r\n",
      "with no better success.  On the day following, Oliver and Mr. Maylie\r\n",
      "repaired to the market-town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something\r\n",
      "of the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless.  After a few\r\n",
      "days, the affair began to be forgotten, as most affairs are, when\r\n",
      "wonder, having no fresh food to support it, dies away of itself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering.  She had left her room: was\r\n",
      "able to go out; and mixing once more with the family, carried joy into\r\n",
      "the hearts of all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little\r\n",
      "circle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more\r\n",
      "heard in the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon\r\n",
      "some there:  even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail to\r\n",
      "remark.  Mrs. Maylie and her son were often closeted together for a\r\n",
      "long time; and more than once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon\r\n",
      "her face.  After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day for his departure to\r\n",
      "Chertsey, these symptoms increased; and it became evident that\r\n",
      "something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady,\r\n",
      "and of somebody else besides.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the breakfast-parlour,\r\n",
      "Harry Maylie entered; and, with some hesitation, begged permission to\r\n",
      "speak with her for a few moments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A few--a very few--will suffice, Rose,' said the young man, drawing\r\n",
      "his chair towards her.  'What I shall have to say, has already\r\n",
      "presented itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are\r\n",
      "not unknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might\r\n",
      "have been the effect of her recent illness.  She merely bowed; and\r\n",
      "bending over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him to\r\n",
      "proceed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I--I--ought to have left here, before,' said Harry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You should, indeed,' replied Rose.  'Forgive me for saying so, but I\r\n",
      "wish you had.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I was brought here, by the most dreadful and agonising of all\r\n",
      "apprehensions,' said the young man; 'the fear of losing the one dear\r\n",
      "being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed.  You had been dying;\r\n",
      "trembling between earth and heaven.  We know that when the young, the\r\n",
      "beautiful, and good, are visited with sickness, their pure spirits\r\n",
      "insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest; we know,\r\n",
      "Heaven help us! that the best and fairest of our kind, too often fade\r\n",
      "in blooming.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were\r\n",
      "spoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent, and\r\n",
      "glistened brightly in its cup, making it more beautiful, it seemed as\r\n",
      "though the outpouring of her fresh young heart, claimed kindred\r\n",
      "naturally, with the loveliest things in nature.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A creature,' continued the young man, passionately, 'a creature as\r\n",
      "fair and innocent of guile as one of God's own angels, fluttered\r\n",
      "between life and death.  Oh! who could hope, when the distant world to\r\n",
      "which she was akin, half opened to her view, that she would return to\r\n",
      "the sorrow and calamity of this!  Rose, Rose, to know that you were\r\n",
      "passing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts\r\n",
      "upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who\r\n",
      "linger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that\r\n",
      "you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and\r\n",
      "the best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all\r\n",
      "these consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved\r\n",
      "you--these were distractions almost too great to bear. They were mine,\r\n",
      "by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears,\r\n",
      "and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never\r\n",
      "know how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in\r\n",
      "its course.  You recovered. Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some\r\n",
      "drop of health came back, and mingling with the spent and feeble stream\r\n",
      "of life which circulated languidly within you, swelled it again to a\r\n",
      "high and rushing tide.  I have watched you change almost from death, to\r\n",
      "life, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep\r\n",
      "affection. Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has\r\n",
      "softened my heart to all mankind.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I did not mean that,' said Rose, weeping; 'I only wish you had left\r\n",
      "here, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to\r\n",
      "pursuits well worthy of you.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There is no pursuit more worthy of me:  more worthy of the highest\r\n",
      "nature that exists:  than the struggle to win such a heart as yours,'\r\n",
      "said the young man, taking her hand. 'Rose, my own dear Rose!  For\r\n",
      "years--for years--I have loved you; hoping to win my way to fame, and\r\n",
      "then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to\r\n",
      "share; thinking, in my daydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy\r\n",
      "moment, of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy's attachment,\r\n",
      "and claim your hand, as in redemption of some old mute contract that\r\n",
      "had been sealed between us!  That time has not arrived; but here, with\r\n",
      "not fame won, and no young vision realised, I offer you the heart so\r\n",
      "long your own, and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the\r\n",
      "offer.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble.' said Rose, mastering the\r\n",
      "emotions by which she was agitated.  'As you believe that I am not\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'It is,' replied Rose, 'that you must endeavour to forget me; not as\r\n",
      "your old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound me deeply;\r\n",
      "but, as the object of your love.  Look into the world; think how many\r\n",
      "hearts you would be proud to gain, are there. Confide some other\r\n",
      "passion to me, if you will; I will be the truest, warmest, and most\r\n",
      "faithful friend you have.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a pause, during which, Rose, who had covered her face with\r\n",
      "one hand, gave free vent to her tears.  Harry still retained the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And your reasons, Rose,' he said, at length, in a low voice; 'your\r\n",
      "reasons for this decision?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You have a right to know them,' rejoined Rose.  'You can say nothing\r\n",
      "to alter my resolution.  It is a duty that I must perform.  I owe it,\r\n",
      "alike to others, and to myself.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'To yourself?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, Harry.  I owe it to myself, that I, a friendless, portionless,\r\n",
      "girl, with a blight upon my name, should not give your friends reason\r\n",
      "to suspect that I had sordidly yielded to your first passion, and\r\n",
      "fastened myself, a clog, on all your hopes and projects.  I owe it to\r\n",
      "you and yours, to prevent you from opposing, in the warmth of your\r\n",
      "generous nature, this great obstacle to your progress in the world.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty--' Harry began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'They do not,' replied Rose, colouring deeply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then you return my love?' said Harry.  'Say but that, dear Rose; say\r\n",
      "but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I loved,'\r\n",
      "rejoined Rose, 'I could have--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Have received this declaration very differently?' said Harry. 'Do not\r\n",
      "conceal that from me, at least, Rose.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I could,' said Rose.  'Stay!' she added, disengaging her hand, 'why\r\n",
      "should we prolong this painful interview?  Most painful to me, and yet\r\n",
      "productive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it _will_ be\r\n",
      "happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which\r\n",
      "I now occupy, and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me\r\n",
      "with new fortitude and firmness.  Farewell, Harry!  As we have met\r\n",
      "to-day, we meet no more; but in other relations than those in which\r\n",
      "this conversation have placed us, we may be long and happily entwined;\r\n",
      "and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can\r\n",
      "call down from the source of all truth and sincerity, cheer and prosper\r\n",
      "you!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Another word, Rose,' said Harry.  'Your reason in your own words.\r\n",
      "From your own lips, let me hear it!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The prospect before you,' answered Rose, firmly, 'is a brilliant one.\r\n",
      "All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can\r\n",
      "help men in public life, are in store for you. But those connections\r\n",
      "are proud; and I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the\r\n",
      "mother who gave me life; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of\r\n",
      "her who has so well supplied that mother's place.  In a word,' said the\r\n",
      "young lady, turning away, as her temporary firmness forsook her, 'there\r\n",
      "is a stain upon my name, which the world visits on innocent heads.  I\r\n",
      "will carry it into no blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest\r\n",
      "alone on me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'One word more, Rose.  Dearest Rose! one more!' cried Harry, throwing\r\n",
      "himself before her.  'If I had been less--less fortunate, the world\r\n",
      "would call it--if some obscure and peaceful life had been my\r\n",
      "destiny--if I had been poor, sick, helpless--would you have turned from\r\n",
      "me then?  Or has my probable advancement to riches and honour, given\r\n",
      "this scruple birth?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do not press me to reply,' answered Rose.  'The question does not\r\n",
      "arise, and never will.  It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,' retorted Harry,\r\n",
      "'it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the\r\n",
      "path before me.  It is not an idle thing to do so much, by the\r\n",
      "utterance of a few brief words, for one who loves you beyond all else.\r\n",
      "Oh, Rose: in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name\r\n",
      "of all I have suffered for you, and all you doom me to undergo; answer\r\n",
      "me this one question!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then, if your lot had been differently cast,' rejoined Rose; 'if you\r\n",
      "had been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have been\r\n",
      "a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement,\r\n",
      "and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds; I\r\n",
      "should have been spared this trial.  I have every reason to be happy,\r\n",
      "very happy, now; but then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Busy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded\r\n",
      "into the mind of Rose, while making this avowal; but they brought tears\r\n",
      "with them, as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they\r\n",
      "relieved her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I cannot help this weakness, and it makes my purpose stronger,' said\r\n",
      "Rose, extending her hand.  'I must leave you now, indeed.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I ask one promise,' said Harry.  'Once, and only once more,--say\r\n",
      "within a year, but it may be much sooner,--I may speak to you again on\r\n",
      "this subject, for the last time.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not to press me to alter my right determination,' replied Rose, with a\r\n",
      "melancholy smile; 'it will be useless.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' said Harry; 'to hear you repeat it, if you will--finally repeat\r\n",
      "it!  I will lay at your feet, whatever of station of fortune I may\r\n",
      "possess; and if you still adhere to your present resolution, will not\r\n",
      "seek, by word or act, to change it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then let it be so,' rejoined Rose; 'it is but one pang the more, and\r\n",
      "by that time I may be enabled to bear it better.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She extended her hand again.  But the young man caught her to his\r\n",

      "which is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when\r\n",

      "proceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which\r\n",

      "pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator. There were not wanting\r\n",
      "other appearances, and those closely connected with his own person,\r\n",
      "which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of\r\n",
      "his affairs.  The laced coat, and the cocked hat; where were they?  He\r\n",
      "still wore knee-breeches, and dark cotton stockings on his nether\r\n",
      "limbs; but they were not _the_ breeches.  The coat was wide-skirted;\r\n",
      "and in that respect like _the_ coat, but, oh how different!  The mighty\r\n",

      "allusion to the dead and gone, than she dropped into a chair, and with\r\n",
      "a loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard-hearted brute, fell into a\r\n",
      "paroxysm of tears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble's soul;\r\n",
      "his heart was waterproof.  Like washable beaver hats that improve with\r\n",
      "rain, his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous, by showers of\r\n",
      "tears, which, being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of\r\n",
      "his own power, pleased and exalted him.  He eyed his good lady with\r\n",
      "looks of great satisfaction, and begged, in an encouraging manner, that\r\n",
      "she should cry her hardest:  the exercise being looked upon, by the\r\n",
      "faculty, as strongly conducive to health.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and\r\n",
      "softens down the temper,' said Mr. Bumble.  'So cry away.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr. Bumble took his hat\r\n",
      "from a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man\r\n",
      "might, who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner,\r\n",
      "thrust his hands into his pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with\r\n",
      "much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less\r\n",
      "troublesome than a manual assault; but, she was quite prepared to make\r\n",
      "trial of the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr. Bumble was not long in\r\n",
      "discovering.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first proof he experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a hollow\r\n",
      "sound, immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the\r\n",
      "opposite end of the room.  This preliminary proceeding laying bare his\r\n",
      "head, the expert lady, clasping him tightly round the throat with one\r\n",
      "hand, inflicted a shower of blows (dealt with singular vigour and\r\n",
      "dexterity) upon it with the other.  This done, she created a little\r\n",
      "variety by scratching his face, and tearing his hair; and, having, by\r\n",
      "this time, inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the\r\n",
      "offence, she pushed him over a chair, which was luckily well situated\r\n",
      "for the purpose:  and defied him to talk about his prerogative again,\r\n",
      "if he dared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Get up!' said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of command.  'And take yourself\r\n",
      "away from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance:  wondering much what\r\n",
      "something desperate might be.  Picking up his hat, he looked towards\r\n",
      "the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Are you going?' demanded Mrs. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Certainly, my dear, certainly,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a quicker\r\n",
      "motion towards the door.  'I didn't intend to--I'm going, my dear!  You\r\n",
      "are so very violent, that really I--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this instant, Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the\r\n",
      "carpet, which had been kicked up in the scuffle.  Mr. Bumble\r\n",
      "immediately darted out of the room, without bestowing another thought\r\n",
      "on his unfinished sentence:  leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full\r\n",
      "possession of the field.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten.  He had a\r\n",
      "decided propensity for bullying:  derived no inconsiderable pleasure\r\n",
      "from the exercise of petty cruelty; and, consequently, was (it is\r\n",
      "needless to say) a coward.  This is by no means a disparagement to his\r\n",
      "character; for many official personages, who are held in high respect\r\n",
      "and admiration, are the victims of similar infirmities.  The remark is\r\n",
      "made, indeed, rather in his favour than otherwise, and with a view of\r\n",
      "impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for\r\n",
      "office.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, the measure of his degradation was not yet full.  After making a\r\n",
      "tour of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor-laws\r\n",
      "really were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their\r\n",
      "wives, leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be\r\n",
      "visited with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious\r\n",
      "individuals who had suffered much; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some\r\n",
      "of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish\r\n",
      "linen:  when the sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hem!' said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his native dignity. 'These\r\n",
      "women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative. Hallo! hallo\r\n",
      "there!  What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very\r\n",
      "fierce and angry manner:  which was at once exchanged for a most\r\n",
      "humiliated and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the\r\n",
      "form of his lady wife.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'My dear,' said Mr. Bumble, 'I didn't know you were here.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Didn't know I was here!' repeated Mrs. Bumble.  'What do _you_ do\r\n",
      "here?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work\r\n",
      "properly, my dear,' replied Mr. Bumble:  glancing distractedly at a\r\n",
      "couple of old women at the wash-tub, who were comparing notes of\r\n",
      "admiration at the workhouse-master's humility.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'_You_ thought they were talking too much?' said Mrs. Bumble. 'What\r\n",
      "business is it of yours?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, my dear--' urged Mr. Bumble submissively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What business is it of yours?' demanded Mrs. Bumble, again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's very true, you're matron here, my dear,' submitted Mr. Bumble;\r\n",
      "'but I thought you mightn't be in the way just then.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,' returned his lady.  'We don't want\r\n",
      "any of your interference.  You're a great deal too fond of poking your\r\n",
      "nose into things that don't concern you, making everybody in the house\r\n",
      "laugh, the moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a\r\n",
      "fool every hour in the day.  Be off; come!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two\r\n",
      "old paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated\r\n",
      "for an instant.  Mrs. Bumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught\r\n",
      "up a bowl of soap-suds, and motioning him towards the door, ordered him\r\n",
      "instantly to depart, on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly\r\n",
      "person.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What could Mr. Bumble do?  He looked dejectedly round, and slunk away;\r\n",
      "and, as he reached the door, the titterings of the paupers broke into a\r\n",
      "shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight.  It wanted but this.  He was\r\n",
      "degraded in their eyes; he had lost caste and station before the very\r\n",
      "paupers; he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship, to\r\n",
      "the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen-peckery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'All in two months!' said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts.\r\n",
      "'Two months!  No more than two months ago, I was not only my own\r\n",
      "master, but everybody else's, so far as the porochial workhouse was\r\n",
      "concerned, and now!--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was too much.  Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the\r\n",
      "gate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and\r\n",
      "walked, distractedly, into the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated\r\n",
      "the first passion of his grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made\r\n",
      "him thirsty.  He passed a great many public-houses; but, at length\r\n",
      "paused before one in a by-way, whose parlour, as he gathered from a\r\n",
      "hasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save by one solitary\r\n",
      "customer.  It began to rain, heavily, at the moment.  This determined\r\n",
      "him.  Mr. Bumble stepped in; and ordering something to drink, as he\r\n",
      "passed the bar, entered the apartment into which he had looked from the\r\n",
      "street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large\r\n",
      "cloak.  He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain\r\n",
      "haggardness in his look, as well as by the dusty soils on his dress, to\r\n",
      "have travelled some distance.  He eyed Bumble askance, as he entered,\r\n",
      "but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his\r\n",
      "salutation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the\r\n",
      "stranger had been more familiar:  so he drank his gin-and-water in\r\n",
      "silence, and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall\r\n",
      "into company under such circumstances:  that Mr. Bumble felt, every now\r\n",
      "and then, a powerful inducement, which he could not resist, to steal a\r\n",
      "look at the stranger:  and that whenever he did so, he withdrew his\r\n",
      "eyes, in some confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment\r\n",
      "stealing a look at him.  Mr. Bumble's awkwardness was enhanced by the\r\n",
      "very remarkable expression of the stranger's eye, which was keen and\r\n",
      "bright, but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike\r\n",
      "anything he had ever observed before, and repulsive to behold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they had encountered each other's glance several times in this\r\n",
      "way, the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Were you looking for me,' he said, 'when you peered in at the window?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not that I am aware of, unless you're Mr.--'  Here Mr. Bumble stopped\r\n",
      "short; for he was curious to know the stranger's name, and thought in\r\n",
      "his impatience, he might supply the blank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I see you were not,' said the stranger; an expression of quiet sarcasm\r\n",
      "playing about his mouth; 'or you have known my name.  You don't know\r\n",
      "it.  I would recommend you not to ask for it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I meant no harm, young man,' observed Mr. Bumble, majestically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And have done none,' said the stranger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another silence succeeded this short dialogue:  which was again broken\r\n",
      "by the stranger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I have seen you before, I think?' said he.  'You were differently\r\n",
      "dressed at that time, and I only passed you in the street, but I should\r\n",
      "know you again.  You were beadle here, once; were you not?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I was,' said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; 'porochial beadle.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Just so,' rejoined the other, nodding his head.  'It was in that\r\n",
      "character I saw you.  What are you now?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Master of the workhouse,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and\r\n",
      "impressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might\r\n",
      "otherwise assume.  'Master of the workhouse, young man!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I\r\n",
      "doubt not?' resumed the stranger, looking keenly into Mr. Bumble's\r\n",
      "eyes, as he raised them in astonishment at the question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Don't scruple to answer freely, man.  I know you pretty well, you see.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I suppose, a married man,' replied Mr. Bumble, shading his eyes with\r\n",
      "his hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident\r\n",
      "perplexity, 'is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can,\r\n",
      "than a single one.  Porochial officers are not so well paid that they\r\n",
      "can afford to refuse any little extra fee, when it comes to them in a\r\n",
      "civil and proper manner.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The stranger smiled, and nodded his head again: as much to say, he had\r\n",
      "not mistaken his man; then rang the bell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Fill this glass again,' he said, handing Mr. Bumble's empty tumbler to\r\n",
      "the landlord.  'Let it be strong and hot.  You like it so, I suppose?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not too strong,' replied Mr. Bumble, with a delicate cough.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You understand what that means, landlord!' said the stranger, drily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned with a\r\n",
      "steaming jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water into Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble's eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now listen to me,' said the stranger, after closing the door and\r\n",
      "window.  'I came down to this place, to-day, to find you out; and, by\r\n",
      "one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends\r\n",
      "sometimes, you walked into the very room I was sitting in, while you\r\n",
      "were uppermost in my mind.  I want some information from you.  I don't\r\n",
      "ask you to give it for nothing, slight as it is.  Put up that, to begin\r\n",
      "with.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke, he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his\r\n",
      "companion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking of money\r\n",
      "should be heard without.  When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the\r\n",
      "coins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much\r\n",
      "satisfaction, in his waistcoat-pocket, he went on:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Carry your memory back--let me see--twelve years, last winter.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's a long time,' said Mr. Bumble.  'Very good.  I've done it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The scene, the workhouse.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Good!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And the time, night.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And the place, the crazy hole, wherever it was, in which miserable\r\n",
      "drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to\r\n",
      "themselves--gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear; and\r\n",
      "hid their shame, rot 'em in the grave!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The lying-in room, I suppose?' said Mr. Bumble, not quite following\r\n",
      "the stranger's excited description.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,' said the stranger.  'A boy was born there.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A many boys,' observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his head, despondingly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A murrain on the young devils!' cried the stranger; 'I speak of one; a\r\n",
      "meek-looking, pale-faced boy, who was apprenticed down here, to a\r\n",
      "coffin-maker--I wish he had made his coffin, and screwed his body in\r\n",
      "it--and who afterwards ran away to London, as it was supposed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, you mean Oliver!  Young Twist!' said Mr. Bumble; 'I remember him,\r\n",
      "of course.  There wasn't a obstinater young rascal--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's not of him I want to hear; I've heard enough of him,' said the\r\n",
      "stranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject\r\n",
      "of poor Oliver's vices.  'It's of a woman; the hag that nursed his\r\n",
      "mother.  Where is she?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Where is she?' said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin-and-water had rendered\r\n",
      "facetious.  'It would be hard to tell.  There's no midwifery there,\r\n",
      "whichever place she's gone to; so I suppose she's out of employment,\r\n",
      "anyway.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What do you mean?' demanded the stranger, sternly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That she died last winter,' rejoined Mr. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information, and\r\n",
      "although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards, his\r\n",
      "gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted, and he seemed lost in\r\n",
      "thought.  For some time, he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be\r\n",
      "relieved or disappointed by the intelligence; but at length he breathed\r\n",
      "more freely; and withdrawing his eyes, observed that it was no great\r\n",
      "matter. With that he rose, as if to depart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mr. Bumble was cunning enough; and he at once saw that an\r\n",
      "opportunity was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in\r\n",
      "the possession of his better half.  He well remembered the night of old\r\n",
      "Sally's death, which the occurrences of that day had given him good\r\n",
      "reason to recollect, as the occasion on which he had proposed to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Corney; and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure\r\n",
      "of which she had been the solitary witness, he had heard enough to know\r\n",
      "that it related to something that had occurred in the old woman's\r\n",
      "attendance, as workhouse nurse, upon the young mother of Oliver Twist.\r\n",
      "Hastily calling this circumstance to mind, he informed the stranger,\r\n",
      "with an air of mystery, that one woman had been closeted with the old\r\n",
      "harridan shortly before she died; and that she could, as he had reason\r\n",
      "to believe, throw some light on the subject of his inquiry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'How can I find her?' said the stranger, thrown off his guard; and\r\n",
      "plainly showing that all his fears (whatever they were) were aroused\r\n",
      "afresh by the intelligence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Only through me,' rejoined Mr. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'When?' cried the stranger, hastily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'To-morrow,' rejoined Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'At nine in the evening,' said the stranger, producing a scrap of\r\n",
      "paper, and writing down upon it, an obscure address by the water-side,\r\n",
      "in characters that betrayed his agitation; 'at nine in the evening,\r\n",
      "bring her to me there.  I needn't tell you to be secret.  It's your\r\n",
      "interest.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words, he led the way to the door, after stopping to pay for\r\n",
      "the liquor that had been drunk.  Shortly remarking that their roads\r\n",
      "were different, he departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic\r\n",
      "repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed that it\r\n",
      "contained no name.  The stranger had not gone far, so he made after him\r\n",
      "to ask it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What do you want?' cried the man, turning quickly round, as Bumble\r\n",
      "touched him on the arm.  'Following me?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Only to ask a question,' said the other, pointing to the scrap of\r\n",

      "been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of\r\n",
      "vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a\r\n",
      "violent thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the\r\n",
      "main street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered\r\n",
      "little colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a-half,\r\n",
      "or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon\r\n",
      "the river.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might,\r\n",
      "perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the\r\n",
      "rain, and sheltering them from observation.  The husband carried a\r\n",
      "lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few\r\n",
      "paces in front, as though--the way being dirty--to give his wife the\r\n",
      "benefit of treading in his heavy footprints.  They went on, in profound\r\n",
      "silence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned\r\n",
      "his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then,\r\n",
      "discovering that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of\r\n",
      "walking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards\r\n",
      "their place of destination.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long\r\n",
      "been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under\r\n",
      "various pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on\r\n",
      "plunder and crime.  It was a collection of mere hovels:  some, hastily\r\n",
      "built with loose bricks: others, of old worm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled\r\n",
      "together without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for\r\n",
      "the most part, within a few feet of the river's bank.  A few leaky\r\n",
      "boats drawn up on the mud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which\r\n",
      "skirted it:  and here and there an oar or coil of rope:  appeared, at\r\n",
      "first, to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages\r\n",
      "pursued some avocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and\r\n",
      "useless condition of the articles thus displayed, would have led a\r\n",
      "passer-by, without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were\r\n",
      "disposed there, rather for the preservation of appearances, than with\r\n",
      "any view to their being actually employed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its\r\n",
      "upper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a\r\n",
      "manufactory of some kind.  It had, in its day, probably furnished\r\n",
      "employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements.  But it had\r\n",
      "long since gone to ruin.  The rat, the worm, and the action of the\r\n",
      "damp, had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a\r\n",
      "considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the\r\n",
      "water; while the remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream,\r\n",
      "seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion,\r\n",
      "and involving itself in the same fate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as\r\n",
      "the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain\r\n",
      "commenced pouring violently down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The place should be somewhere here,' said Bumble, consulting a scrap\r\n",
      "of paper he held in his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Halloa there!' cried a voice from above.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Following the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man\r\n",
      "looking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stand still, a minute,' cried the voice; 'I'll be with you directly.'\r\n",
      "With which the head disappeared, and the door closed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is that the man?' asked Mr. Bumble's good lady.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then, mind what I told you,' said the matron: 'and be careful to say\r\n",
      "as little as you can, or you'll betray us at once.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was\r\n",
      "apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of\r\n",
      "proceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was\r\n",
      "prevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near\r\n",
      "which they stood, and beckoned them inwards.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come in!' he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground.\r\n",
      "'Don't keep me here!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any\r\n",
      "other invitation.  Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind,\r\n",
      "followed:  obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that\r\n",
      "remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?' said\r\n",
      "Monks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted the\r\n",
      "door behind them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We--we were only cooling ourselves,' stammered Bumble, looking\r\n",
      "apprehensively about him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Cooling yourselves!' retorted Monks.  'Not all the rain that ever\r\n",
      "fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell's fire out, as a man\r\n",
      "can carry about with him.  You won't cool yourself so easily; don't\r\n",
      "think it!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron, and\r\n",
      "bent his gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily cowed, was\r\n",
      "fain to withdraw her eyes, and turn them towards the ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This is the woman, is it?' demanded Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hem!  That is the woman,' replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his wife's\r\n",
      "caution.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?' said the matron,\r\n",
      "interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching look of Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I know they will always keep _one_ till it's found out,' said Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And what may that be?' asked the matron.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The loss of their own good name,' replied Monks.  'So, by the same\r\n",
      "rule, if a woman's a party to a secret that might hang or transport\r\n",
      "her, I'm not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I!  Do you\r\n",
      "understand, mistress?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Of course you don't!' said Monks.  'How should you?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two\r\n",
      "companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened\r\n",
      "across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the\r\n",
      "roof.  He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder,\r\n",
      "leading to another floor of warehouses above:  when a bright flash of\r\n",
      "lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed,\r\n",
      "which shook the crazy building to its centre.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hear it!' he cried, shrinking back.  'Hear it!  Rolling and crashing\r\n",
      "on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were\r\n",
      "hiding from it.  I hate the sound!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands\r\n",
      "suddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble, that it was much distorted and discoloured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'These fits come over me, now and then,' said Monks, observing his\r\n",
      "alarm; 'and thunder sometimes brings them on. Don't mind me now; it's\r\n",
      "all over for this once.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus speaking, he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the\r\n",
      "window-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which\r\n",
      "hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy\r\n",
      "beams in the ceiling:  and which cast a dim light upon an old table and\r\n",
      "three chairs that were placed beneath it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now,' said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, 'the\r\n",
      "sooner we come to our business, the better for all.  The woman know\r\n",
      "what it is, does she?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The question was addressed to Bumble; but his wife anticipated the\r\n",
      "reply, by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died;\r\n",
      "and that she told you something--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'About the mother of the boy you named,' replied the matron\r\n",
      "interrupting him.  'Yes.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The first question is, of what nature was her communication?' said\r\n",
      "Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's the second,' observed the woman with much deliberation. 'The\r\n",
      "first is, what may the communication be worth?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?'\r\n",
      "asked Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nobody better than you, I am persuaded,' answered Mrs. Bumble: who did\r\n",
      "not want for spirit, as her yoke-fellow could abundantly testify.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Humph!' said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager inquiry;\r\n",
      "'there may be money's worth to get, eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Perhaps there may,' was the composed reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Something that was taken from her,' said Monks.  'Something that she\r\n",
      "wore.  Something that--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You had better bid,' interrupted Mrs. Bumble.  'I have heard enough,\r\n",
      "already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any\r\n",
      "greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened\r\n",
      "to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes:  which he\r\n",
      "directed towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised\r\n",
      "astonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded,\r\n",
      "what sum was required for the disclosure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's it worth to you?' asked the woman, as collectedly as before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,' replied Monks. 'Speak\r\n",
      "out, and let me know which.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Add five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five-and-twenty\r\n",
      "pounds in gold,' said the woman; 'and I'll tell you all I know.  Not\r\n",
      "before.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Five-and-twenty pounds!' exclaimed Monks, drawing back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I spoke as plainly as I could,' replied Mrs. Bumble.  'It's not a\r\n",
      "large sum, either.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when it's\r\n",
      "told!' cried Monks impatiently; 'and which has been lying dead for\r\n",
      "twelve years past or more!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Such matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value\r\n",
      "in course of time,' answered the matron, still preserving the resolute\r\n",
      "indifference she had assumed.  'As to lying dead, there are those who\r\n",
      "will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for\r\n",
      "anything you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What if I pay it for nothing?' asked Monks, hesitating.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You can easily take it away again,' replied the matron. 'I am but a\r\n",
      "woman; alone here; and unprotected.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,' submitted Mr. Bumble,\r\n",
      "in a voice tremulous with fear: '_I_ am here, my dear. And besides,'\r\n",
      "said Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, 'Mr. Monks is too\r\n",
      "much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons.  Mr.\r\n",
      "Monks is aware that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a\r\n",
      "little run to seed, as I may say; bu he has heerd:  I say I have no\r\n",
      "doubt Mr. Monks has heerd, my dear:  that I am a very determined\r\n",
      "officer, with very uncommon strength, if I'm once roused.  I only want\r\n",
      "a little rousing; that's all.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern\r\n",
      "with fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed\r\n",
      "expression of every feature, that he _did_ want a little rousing, and\r\n",
      "not a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless,\r\n",
      "indeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for\r\n",
      "the purpose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You are a fool,' said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; 'and had better hold your\r\n",
      "tongue.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He had better have cut it out, before he came, if he can't speak in a\r\n",
      "lower tone,' said Monks, grimly.  'So!  He's your husband, eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He my husband!' tittered the matron, parrying the question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I thought as much, when you came in,' rejoined Monks, marking the\r\n",
      "angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke.  'So\r\n",
      "much the better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people,\r\n",
      "when I find that there's only one will between them.  I'm in earnest.\r\n",
      "See here!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He thrust his hand into a side-pocket; and producing a canvas bag, told\r\n",
      "out twenty-five sovereigns on the table, and pushed them over to the\r\n",
      "woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now,' he said, 'gather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder,\r\n",
      "which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top, is gone, let's\r\n",
      "hear your story.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break\r\n",
      "almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his face from\r\n",
      "the table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say.  The\r\n",
      "faces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the small\r\n",
      "table in their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to\r\n",
      "render her whisper audible.  The sickly rays of the suspended lantern\r\n",
      "falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of\r\n",
      "their countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness,\r\n",
      "looked ghastly in the extreme.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'When this woman, that we called old Sally, died,' the matron began,\r\n",
      "'she and I were alone.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Was there no one by?' asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper; 'No\r\n",
      "sick wretch or idiot in some other bed?  No one who could hear, and\r\n",
      "might, by possibility, understand?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not a soul,' replied the woman; 'we were alone.  _I_ stood alone\r\n",
      "beside the body when death came over it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Good,' said Monks, regarding her attentively.  'Go on.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She spoke of a young creature,' resumed the matron, 'who had brought a\r\n",
      "child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room,\r\n",
      "but in the same bed, in which she then lay dying.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ay?' said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his shoulder,\r\n",
      "'Blood!  How things come about!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The child was the one you named to him last night,' said the matron,\r\n",
      "nodding carelessly towards her husband; 'the mother this nurse had\r\n",
      "robbed.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'In life?' asked Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'In death,' replied the woman, with something like a shudder. 'She\r\n",
      "stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the\r\n",
      "dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the\r\n",
      "infant's sake.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She sold it,' cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; 'did she sell it?\r\n",
      "Where?  When?  To whom?  How long before?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'As she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this,' said\r\n",
      "the matron, 'she fell back and died.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Without saying more?' cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very\r\n",
      "suppression, seemed only the more furious.  'It's a lie! I'll not be\r\n",
      "played with.  She said more.  I'll tear the life out of you both, but\r\n",
      "I'll know what it was.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She didn't utter another word,' said the woman, to all appearance\r\n",
      "unmoved (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being) by the strange man's\r\n",
      "violence; 'but she clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which\r\n",
      "was partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed the\r\n",
      "hand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Which contained--' interposed Monks, stretching forward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing,' replied the woman; 'it was a pawnbroker's duplicate.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'For what?' demanded Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'In good time I'll tell you.' said the woman.  'I judge that she had\r\n",
      "kept the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to better\r\n",
      "account; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together\r\n",
      "money to pay the pawnbroker's interest year by year, and prevent its\r\n",
      "running out; so that if anything came of it, it could still be\r\n",
      "redeemed.  Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you, she died with\r\n",
      "the scrap of paper, all worn and tattered, in her hand.  The time was\r\n",
      "out in two days; I thought something might one day come of it too; and\r\n",
      "so redeemed the pledge.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Where is it now?' asked Monks quickly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'_There_,' replied the woman.  And, as if glad to be relieved of it,\r\n",
      "she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough\r\n",
      "for a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling\r\n",
      "hands.  It contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of\r\n",
      "hair, and a plain gold wedding-ring.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It has the word \"Agnes\" engraved on the inside,' said the woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date;\r\n",
      "which is within a year before the child was born.  I found out that.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And this is all?' said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of the\r\n",
      "contents of the little packet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'All,' replied the woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the\r\n",
      "story was over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty\r\n",
      "pounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration\r\n",
      "which had been trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of\r\n",
      "the previous dialogue.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,' said his\r\n",
      "wife addressing Monks, after a short silence; 'and I want to know\r\n",
      "nothing; for it's safer not.  But I may ask you two questions, may I?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You may ask,' said Monks, with some show of surprise; 'but whether I\r\n",
      "answer or not is another question.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'--Which makes three,' observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of\r\n",
      "facetiousness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is that what you expected to get from me?' demanded the matron.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It is,' replied Monks.  'The other question?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What do you propose to do with it?  Can it be used against me?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Never,' rejoined Monks; 'nor against me either.  See here!  But don't\r\n",
      "move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an\r\n",
      "iron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened\r\n",
      "close at Mr. Bumble's feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several\r\n",
      "paces backward, with great precipitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Look down,' said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf. 'Don't\r\n",
      "fear me.  I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were\r\n",
      "seated over it, if that had been my game.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble\r\n",
      "himself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same. The turbid\r\n",
      "water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all\r\n",
      "other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against\r\n",
      "the green and slimy piles.  There had once been a water-mill beneath;\r\n",
      "the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes, and fragments\r\n",
      "of machinery that yet remained, seemed to dart onward, with a new\r\n",
      "impulse, when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted\r\n",
      "to stem its headlong course.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If you flung a man's body down there, where would it be to-morrow\r\n",
      "morning?' said Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Twelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,' replied\r\n",
      "Bumble, recoiling at the thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Monks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly\r\n",
      "thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of\r\n",
      "some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream.\r\n",
      "It fell straight, and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely\r\n",
      "audible splash; and was gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The three looking into each other's faces, seemed to breathe more\r\n",
      "freely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There!' said Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back\r\n",
      "into its former position.  'If the sea ever gives up its dead, as books\r\n",
      "say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash\r\n",
      "among it.  We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant\r\n",
      "party.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'By all means,' observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You'll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?' said Monks, with a\r\n",
      "threatening look.  'I am not afraid of your wife.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You may depend upon me, young man,' answered Mr. Bumble, bowing\r\n",
      "himself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness. 'On\r\n",
      "everybody's account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. Monks.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I am glad, for your sake, to hear it,' remarked Monks. 'Light your\r\n",
      "lantern!  And get away from here as fast as you can.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr.\r\n",
      "Bumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would\r\n",
      "infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below.  He lighted his\r\n",
      "lantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope, and now\r\n",
      "carried in his hand; and making no effort to prolong the discourse,\r\n",
      "descended in silence, followed by his wife.  Monks brought up the rear,\r\n",
      "after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other\r\n",
      "sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without, and the\r\n",
      "rushing of the water.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks\r\n",
      "started at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his lantern a foot\r\n",
      "above the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a\r\n",
      "marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure:  looking\r\n",
      "nervously about him for hidden trap-doors.  The gate at which they had\r\n",
      "entered, was softly unfastened and opened by Monks; merely exchanging a\r\n",
      "nod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into\r\n",
      "the wet and darkness outside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain an\r\n",
      "invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been\r\n",
      "hidden somewhere below. Bidding him go first, and bear the light, he\r\n",
      "returned to the chamber he had just quitted.\r\n",

      "On the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned\r\n",
      "in the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as\r\n",
      "therein narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily\r\n",
      "growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of\r\n",
      "those he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it\r\n",
      "was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great\r\n",
      "distance from his former lodgings.  It was not, in appearance, so\r\n",
      "desirable a habitation as his old quarters:  being a mean and\r\n",
      "badly-furnished apartment, of very limited size; lighted only by one\r\n",
      "small window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close and dirty\r\n",
      "lane.  Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman's\r\n",
      "having gone down in the world of late:  for a great scarcity of\r\n",
      "furniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the\r\n",
      "disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen,\r\n",
      "bespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated\r\n",
      "condition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these\r\n",
      "symptoms, if they had stood in any need of corroboration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great-coat,\r\n",
      "by way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree\r\n",
      "improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled\r\n",
      "nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week's growth.  The dog sat at\r\n",
      "the bedside:  now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now\r\n",
      "pricking his ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the\r\n",
      "street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his attention.\r\n",
      "Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which\r\n",
      "formed a portion of the robber's ordinary dress, was a female:  so pale\r\n",
      "and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been\r\n",
      "considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has\r\n",
      "already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to\r\n",
      "Mr. Sikes's question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not long gone seven,' said the girl.  'How do you feel to-night, Bill?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'As weak as water,' replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his eyes\r\n",
      "and limbs.  'Here; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering\r\n",
      "bed anyhow.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes's temper; for, as the girl raised\r\n",
      "him up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her\r\n",
      "awkwardness, and struck her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Whining are you?' said Sikes.  'Come!  Don't stand snivelling there.\r\n",
      "If you can't do anything better than that, cut off altogether.  D'ye\r\n",
      "hear me?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I hear you,' replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing a\r\n",
      "laugh.  'What fancy have you got in your head now?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh! you've thought better of it, have you?' growled Sikes, marking the\r\n",
      "tear which trembled in her eye.  'All the better for you, you have.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, you don't mean to say, you'd be hard upon me to-night, Bill,'\r\n",
      "said the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No!' cried Mr. Sikes.  'Why not?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Such a number of nights,' said the girl, with a touch of woman's\r\n",
      "tenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone, even\r\n",
      "to her voice: 'such a number of nights as I've been patient with you,\r\n",
      "nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the\r\n",
      "first that I've seen you like yourself; you wouldn't have served me as\r\n",
      "you did just now, if you'd thought of that, would you?  Come, come; say\r\n",
      "you wouldn't.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, then,' rejoined Mr. Sikes, 'I wouldn't.  Why, damme, now, the\r\n",
      "girls's whining again!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's nothing,' said the girl, throwing herself into a chair. 'Don't\r\n",
      "you seem to mind me.  It'll soon be over.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What'll be over?' demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice. 'What foolery\r\n",
      "are you up to, now, again?  Get up and bustle about, and don't come\r\n",
      "over me with your woman's nonsense.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was\r\n",
      "delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really\r\n",
      "weak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and\r\n",
      "fainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths\r\n",
      "with which, on similar occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his\r\n",
      "threats.  Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon\r\n",
      "emergency; for Miss Nancy's hysterics were usually of that violent kind\r\n",
      "which the patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance;\r\n",
      "Mr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment\r\n",
      "wholly ineffectual, called for assistance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's the matter here, my dear?' said Fagin, looking in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Lend a hand to the girl, can't you?' replied Sikes impatiently. 'Don't\r\n",
      "stand chattering and grinning at me!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl's\r\n",
      "assistance, while Mr. John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger), who\r\n",
      "had followed his venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on\r\n",
      "the floor a bundle with which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from\r\n",
      "the grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his heels, uncorked\r\n",
      "it in a twinkling with his teeth, and poured a portion of its contents\r\n",
      "down the patient's throat:  previously taking a taste, himself, to\r\n",
      "prevent mistakes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,' said Mr.\r\n",
      "Dawkins; 'and you slap her hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the\r\n",
      "petticuts.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially\r\n",
      "that department consigned to Master Bates, who appeared to consider his\r\n",
      "share in the proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry:  were not\r\n",
      "long in producing the desired effect.  The girl gradually recovered her\r\n",
      "senses; and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her face upon\r\n",
      "the pillow:  leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers, in some\r\n",
      "astonishment at their unlooked-for appearance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, what evil wind has blowed you here?' he asked Fagin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and\r\n",
      "I've brought something good with me, that you'll be glad to see.\r\n",
      "Dodger, my dear, open the bundle; and give Bill the little trifles that\r\n",
      "we spent all our money on, this morning.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In compliance with Mr. Fagin's request, the Artful untied this bundle,\r\n",
      "which was of large size, and formed of an old table-cloth; and handed\r\n",
      "the articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed\r\n",
      "them on the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and\r\n",
      "excellence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Sitch a rabbit pie, Bill,' exclaimed that young gentleman, disclosing\r\n",
      "to view a huge pasty; 'sitch delicate creeturs, with sitch tender\r\n",
      "limbs, Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth, and there's no\r\n",
      "occasion to pick 'em; half a pound of seven and six-penny green, so\r\n",
      "precious strong that if you mix it with biling water, it'll go nigh to\r\n",
      "blow the lid of the tea-pot off; a pound and a half of moist sugar that\r\n",
      "the niggers didn't work at all at, afore they got it up to sitch a\r\n",
      "pitch of goodness,--oh no!  Two half-quartern brans; pound of best\r\n",
      "fresh; piece of double Glo'ster; and, to wind up all, some of the\r\n",
      "richest sort you ever lushed!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Uttering this last panegyric, Master Bates produced, from one of his\r\n",
      "extensive pockets, a full-sized wine-bottle, carefully corked; while\r\n",
      "Mr. Dawkins, at the same instant, poured out a wine-glassful of raw\r\n",
      "spirits from the bottle he carried:  which the invalid tossed down his\r\n",
      "throat without a moment's hesitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah!' said Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction. 'You'll\r\n",
      "do, Bill; you'll do now.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do!' exclaimed Mr. Sikes; 'I might have been done for, twenty times\r\n",
      "over, afore you'd have done anything to help me.  What do you mean by\r\n",
      "leaving a man in this state, three weeks and more, you false-hearted\r\n",
      "wagabond?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Only hear him, boys!' said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders. 'And us\r\n",
      "come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The things is well enough in their way,' observed Mr. Sikes:  a little\r\n",
      "soothed as he glanced over the table; 'but what have you got to say for\r\n",
      "yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health,\r\n",
      "blunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this\r\n",
      "mortal time, than if I was that 'ere dog.--Drive him down, Charley!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I never see such a jolly dog as that,' cried Master Bates, doing as he\r\n",
      "was desired.  'Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market!\r\n",
      "He'd make his fortun' on the stage that dog would, and rewive the\r\n",
      "drayma besides.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hold your din,' cried Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed: still\r\n",
      "growling angrily.  'What have you got to say for yourself, you withered\r\n",
      "old fence, eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,' replied\r\n",
      "the Jew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And what about the other fortnight?' demanded Sikes.  'What about the\r\n",
      "other fortnight that you've left me lying here, like a sick rat in his\r\n",
      "hole?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I couldn't help it, Bill.  I can't go into a long explanation before\r\n",
      "company; but I couldn't help it, upon my honour.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Upon your what?' growled Sikes, with excessive disgust. 'Here! Cut me\r\n",
      "off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out\r\n",
      "of my mouth, or it'll choke me dead.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Don't be out of temper, my dear,' urged Fagin, submissively. 'I have\r\n",
      "never forgot you, Bill; never once.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No!  I'll pound it that you han't,' replied Sikes, with a bitter grin.\r\n",
      "'You've been scheming and plotting away, every hour that I have laid\r\n",
      "shivering and burning here; and Bill was to do this; and Bill was to do\r\n",
      "that; and Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap, as soon as he got well:\r\n",
      "and was quite poor enough for your work. If it hadn't been for the\r\n",
      "girl, I might have died.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There now, Bill,' remonstrated Fagin, eagerly catching at the word.\r\n",
      "'If it hadn't been for the girl!  Who but poor ould Fagin was the means\r\n",
      "of your having such a handy girl about you?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He says true enough there!' said Nancy, coming hastily forward. 'Let\r\n",
      "him be; let him be.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nancy's appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys,\r\n",
      "receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with\r\n",
      "liquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin,\r\n",
      "assuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a\r\n",
      "better temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant\r\n",
      "banter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough\r\n",
      "jokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he\r\n",
      "condescended to make.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's all very well,' said Mr. Sikes; 'but I must have some blunt from\r\n",
      "you to-night.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I haven't a piece of coin about me,' replied the Jew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then you've got lots at home,' retorted Sikes; 'and I must have some\r\n",
      "from there.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Lots!' cried Fagin, holding up is hands.  'I haven't so much as\r\n",
      "would--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't know how much you've got, and I dare say you hardly know\r\n",
      "yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,' said Sikes;\r\n",
      "'but I must have some to-night; and that's flat.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, well,' said Fagin, with a sigh, 'I'll send the Artful round\r\n",
      "presently.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You won't do nothing of the kind,' rejoined Mr. Sikes. 'The Artful's a\r\n",
      "deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his way, or get\r\n",
      "dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you\r\n",
      "put him up to it.  Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all\r\n",
      "sure; and I'll lie down and have a snooze while she's gone.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the\r\n",
      "amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four\r\n",
      "and sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would\r\n",
      "only leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly\r\n",
      "remarking that if he couldn't get any more he must accompany him home;\r\n",
      "with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard.  The\r\n",
      "Jew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward,\r\n",
      "attended by Nancy and the boys:  Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself\r\n",
      "on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the\r\n",
      "young lady's return.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In due course, they arrived at Fagin's abode, where they found Toby\r\n",
      "Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage,\r\n",
      "which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and\r\n",
      "with it, his fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his\r\n",
      "young friends.  Mr. Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found\r\n",
      "relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and\r\n",
      "mental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat\r\n",
      "to go.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Has nobody been, Toby?' asked Fagin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not a living leg,' answered Mr. Crackit, pulling up his collar; 'it's\r\n",
      "been as dull as swipes.  You ought to stand something handsome, Fagin,\r\n",
      "to recompense me for keeping house so long. Damme, I'm as flat as a\r\n",
      "juryman; and should have gone to sleep, as fast as Newgate, if I hadn't\r\n",
      "had the good natur' to amuse this youngster.  Horrid dull, I'm blessed\r\n",
      "if I an't!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these and other ejaculations of the same kind, Mr. Toby Crackit\r\n",
      "swept up his winnings, and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with\r\n",
      "a haughty air, as though such small pieces of silver were wholly\r\n",
      "beneath the consideration of a man of his figure; this done, he\r\n",
      "swaggered out of the room, with so much elegance and gentility, that\r\n",
      "Mr. Chitling, bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots\r\n",
      "till they were out of sight, assured the company that he considered his\r\n",
      "acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview, and that he\r\n",
      "didn't value his losses the snap of his little finger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Wot a rum chap you are, Tom!' said Master Bates, highly amused by this\r\n",
      "declaration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not a bit of it,' replied Mr. Chitling.  'Am I, Fagin?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A very clever fellow, my dear,' said Fagin, patting him on the\r\n",
      "shoulder, and winking to his other pupils.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell; an't he, Fagin?' asked Tom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No doubt at all of that, my dear.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance; an't it,\r\n",
      "Fagin?' pursued Tom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Very much so, indeed, my dear.  They're only jealous, Tom, because he\r\n",
      "won't give it to them.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah!' cried Tom, triumphantly, 'that's where it is!  He has cleaned me\r\n",
      "out.  But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can't I, Fagin?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'To be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up\r\n",
      "your loss at once, and don't lose any more time.  Dodger! Charley!\r\n",
      "It's time you were on the lay.  Come!  It's near ten, and nothing done\r\n",
      "yet.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their\r\n",
      "hats, and left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging,\r\n",
      "as they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in\r\n",
      "whose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very\r\n",
      "conspicuous or peculiar:  inasmuch as there are a great number of\r\n",
      "spirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than Mr.\r\n",
      "Chitling for being seen in good society:  and a great number of fine\r\n",
      "gentlemen (composing the good society aforesaid) who established their\r\n",
      "reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now,' said Fagin, when they had left the room, 'I'll go and get you\r\n",
      "that cash, Nancy.  This is only the key of a little cupboard where I\r\n",
      "keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear.  I never lock up my money,\r\n",
      "for I've got none to lock up, my dear--ha! ha! ha!--none to lock up.\r\n",
      "It's a poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I'm fond of seeing the\r\n",
      "young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all.  Hush!' he\r\n",
      "said, hastily concealing the key in his breast; 'who's that?  Listen!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms folded, appeared\r\n",
      "in no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person,\r\n",
      "whoever he was, came or went:  until the murmur of a man's voice\r\n",
      "reached her ears.  The instant she caught the sound, she tore off her\r\n",
      "bonnet and shawl, with the rapidity of lightning, and thrust them under\r\n",
      "the table. The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered\r\n",
      "a complaint of the heat:  in a tone of languor that contrasted, very\r\n",
      "remarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this action:  which,\r\n",
      "however, had been unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards her at\r\n",
      "the time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bah!' he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; 'it's the\r\n",
      "man I expected before; he's coming downstairs.  Not a word about the\r\n",
      "money while he's here, Nance.  He won't stop long.  Not ten minutes, my\r\n",
      "dear.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a candle to\r\n",
      "the door, as a man's step was heard upon the stairs without.  He\r\n",
      "reached it, at the same moment as the visitor, who, coming hastily into\r\n",
      "the room, was close upon the girl before he observed her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Only one of my young people,' said Fagin, observing that Monks drew\r\n",
      "back, on beholding a stranger.  'Don't move, Nancy.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of\r\n",
      "careless levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she\r\n",
      "stole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if\r\n",
      "there had been any bystander to observe the change, he could hardly\r\n",
      "have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Any news?' inquired Fagin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Great.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And--and--good?' asked Fagin, hesitating as though he feared to vex\r\n",
      "the other man by being too sanguine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not bad, any way,' replied Monks with a smile.  'I have been prompt\r\n",
      "enough this time.  Let me have a word with you.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room,\r\n",
      "although she could see that Monks was pointing to her.  The Jew:\r\n",
      "perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he\r\n",
      "endeavoured to get rid of her:  pointed upward, and took Monks out of\r\n",
      "the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not that infernal hole we were in before,' she could hear the man say\r\n",
      "as they went upstairs.  Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did\r\n",
      "not reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his\r\n",
      "companion to the second story.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the\r\n",
      "house, the girl had slipped off her shoes; and drawing her gown loosely\r\n",
      "over her head, and muffling her arms in it, stood at the door,\r\n",
      "listening with breathless interest.  The moment the noise ceased, she\r\n",
      "glided from the room; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and\r\n",
      "silence; and was lost in the gloom above.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl\r\n",
      "glided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards,\r\n",
      "the two men were heard descending.  Monks went at once into the street;\r\n",
      "and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money.  When he returned,\r\n",
      "the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet, as if preparing to be gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, Nance!' exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the\r\n",
      "candle, 'how pale you are!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Pale!' echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to look\r\n",
      "steadily at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Quite horrible.  What have you been doing to yourself?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I don't\r\n",
      "know how long and all,' replied the girl carelessly. 'Come!  Let me get\r\n",
      "back; that's a dear.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into her\r\n",
      "hand.  They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a\r\n",
      "'good-night.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a doorstep;\r\n",
      "and seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and unable to pursue\r\n",
      "her way.  Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite\r\n",
      "opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her returned, quickened\r\n",
      "her pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run.  After\r\n",
      "completely exhausting herself, she stopped to take breath:  and, as if\r\n",
      "suddenly recollecting herself, and deploring her inability to do\r\n",
      "something she was bent upon, wrung her hands, and burst into tears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It might be that her tears relieved her, or that she felt the full\r\n",
      "hopelessness of her condition; but she turned back; and hurrying with\r\n",
      "nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover\r\n",
      "lost time, and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own\r\n",
      "thoughts:  soon reached the dwelling where she had left the\r\n",
      "housebreaker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes,\r\n",
      "he did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the\r\n",
      "money, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he uttered a growl of\r\n",
      "satisfaction, and replacing his head upon the pillow, resumed the\r\n",
      "slumbers which her arrival had interrupted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so\r\n",
      "much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal\r\n",
      "had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his\r\n",
      "temper; that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical\r\n",
      "upon her behaviour and deportment.  That she had all the abstracted and\r\n",
      "nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous\r\n",
      "step, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would\r\n",
      "have been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have\r\n",
      "taken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of\r\n",
      "discrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than\r\n",
      "those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour\r\n",
      "towards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable\r\n",
      "condition, as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her\r\n",
      "demeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her, that, had\r\n",
      "her agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been\r\n",
      "very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As that day closed in, the girl's excitement increased; and, when night\r\n",
      "came on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink\r\n",
      "himself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her cheek, and a fire\r\n",
      "in her eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water\r\n",
      "with his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass\r\n",
      "towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when\r\n",
      "these symptoms first struck him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, burn my body!' said the man, raising himself on his hands as he\r\n",
      "stared the girl in the face.  'You look like a corpse come to life\r\n",
      "again.  What's the matter?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Matter!' replied the girl.  'Nothing.  What do you look at me so hard\r\n",
      "for?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What foolery is this?' demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm, and\r\n",
      "shaking her roughly.  'What is it?  What do you mean?  What are you\r\n",
      "thinking of?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Of many things, Bill,' replied the girl, shivering, and as she did so,\r\n",
      "pressing her hands upon her eyes.  'But, Lord!  What odds in that?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed\r\n",
      "to produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look\r\n",
      "which had preceded them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I tell you wot it is,' said Sikes; 'if you haven't caught the fever,\r\n",
      "and got it comin' on, now, there's something more than usual in the\r\n",
      "wind, and something dangerous too.  You're not a-going to--.  No,\r\n",
      "damme! you wouldn't do that!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do what?' asked the girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There ain't,' said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the\r\n",
      "words to himself; 'there ain't a stauncher-hearted gal going, or I'd\r\n",
      "have cut her throat three months ago.  She's got the fever coming on;\r\n",
      "that's it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the\r\n",
      "bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic.\r\n",
      "The girl jumped up, with great alacrity; poured it quickly out, but\r\n",
      "with her back towards him; and held the vessel to his lips, while he\r\n",
      "drank off the contents.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now,' said the robber, 'come and sit aside of me, and put on your own\r\n",
      "face; or I'll alter it so, that you won't know it agin when you do want\r\n",
      "it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl obeyed.  Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon the\r\n",
      "pillow: turning his eyes upon her face.  They closed; opened again;\r\n",
      "closed once more; again opened.  He shifted his position restlessly;\r\n",
      "and, after dozing again, and again, for two or three minutes, and as\r\n",
      "often springing up with a look of terror, and gazing vacantly about\r\n",
      "him, was suddenly stricken, as it were, while in the very attitude of\r\n",
      "rising, into a deep and heavy sleep.  The grasp of his hand relaxed;\r\n",
      "the upraised arm fell languidly by his side; and he lay like one in a\r\n",
      "profound trance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The laudanum has taken effect at last,' murmured the girl, as she rose\r\n",
      "from the bedside.  'I may be too late, even now.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl:  looking fearfully\r\n",
      "round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she\r\n",
      "expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes's heavy hand upon\r\n",
      "her shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the\r\n",
      "robber's lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with\r\n",
      "noiseless touch, hurried from the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through which\r\n",
      "she had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Has it long gone the half-hour?' asked the girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It'll strike the hour in another quarter,' said the man: raising his\r\n",
      "lantern to her face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,' muttered Nancy:\r\n",
      "brushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues\r\n",
      "through which she tracked her way, in making from Spitalfields towards\r\n",
      "the West-End of London.  The clock struck ten, increasing her\r\n",
      "impatience.  She tore along the narrow pavement:  elbowing the\r\n",
      "passengers from side to side; and darting almost under the horses'\r\n",
      "heads, crossed crowded streets, where clusters of persons were eagerly\r\n",
      "watching their opportunity to do the like.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The woman is mad!' said the people, turning to look after her as she\r\n",
      "rushed away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were\r\n",
      "comparatively deserted; and here her headlong progress excited a still\r\n",
      "greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past.  Some\r\n",
      "quickened their pace behind, as though to see whither she was hastening\r\n",
      "at such an unusual rate; and a few made head upon her, and looked back,\r\n",
      "surprised at her undiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and\r\n",
      "when she neared her place of destination, she was alone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park.\r\n",
      "As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door, guided\r\n",
      "her to the spot, the clock struck eleven.  She had loitered for a few\r\n",
      "paces as though irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the\r\n",
      "sound determined her, and she stepped into the hall.  The porter's seat\r\n",
      "was vacant.  She looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced\r\n",
      "towards the stairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now, young woman!' said a smartly-dressed female, looking out from a\r\n",
      "door behind her, 'who do you want here?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A lady who is stopping in this house,' answered the girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A lady!' was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look. 'What lady?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Miss Maylie,' said Nancy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance, replied\r\n",
      "only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her.\r\n",
      "To him, Nancy repeated her request.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What name am I to say?' asked the waiter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's of no use saying any,' replied Nancy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nor business?' said the man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, nor that neither,' rejoined the girl.  'I must see the lady.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come!' said the man, pushing her towards the door.  'None of this.\r\n",
      "Take yourself off.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I shall be carried out if I go!' said the girl violently; 'and I can\r\n",
      "make that a job that two of you won't like to do.  Isn't there anybody\r\n",
      "here,' she said, looking round, 'that will see a simple message carried\r\n",
      "for a poor wretch like me?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook, who\r\n",
      "with some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward\r\n",
      "to interfere.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The girl's life had been squandered in the streets, and among the most\r\n",
      "noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was something of the\r\n",
      "woman's original nature left in her still; and when she heard a light\r\n",
      "step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered,\r\n",
      "and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another\r\n",
      "moment contain, she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame,\r\n",

      "whom she had sought this interview.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But struggling with these better feelings was pride,--the vice of the\r\n",

      "fallen outcast of low haunts, the associate of the scourings of the\r\n",
      "jails and hulks, living within the shadow of the gallows itself,--even\r\n",
      "this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the\r\n",
      "womanly feeling which she thought a weakness, but which alone connected\r\n",
      "her with that humanity, of which her wasting life had obliterated so\r\n",
      "many, many traces when a very child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which\r\n",

      "them on the ground, she tossed her head with affected carelessness as\r\n",
      "she said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's a hard matter to get to see you, lady.  If I had taken offence,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the\r\n",
      "absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the girl\r\n",
      "completely by surprise, and she burst into tears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can,--I shall indeed.  Sit\r\n",
      "down.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Is--is--that door shut?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "in case she should require it.  'Why?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Because,' said the girl, 'I am about to put my life and the lives of\r\n",
      "others in your hands.  I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to\r\n",
      "old Fagin's on the night he went out from the house in Pentonville.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You!' said Rose Maylie.\r\n",

      "moment I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets\r\n",
      "have known any better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so\r\n",
      "help me God!  Do not mind shrinking openly from me, lady.  I am younger\r\n",
      "than you would think, to look at me, but I am well used to it. The\r\n",
      "poorest women fall back, as I make my way along the crowded pavement.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What dreadful things are these!' said Rose, involuntarily falling from\r\n",
      "her strange companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Thank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady,' cried the girl, 'that you\r\n",
      "had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood, and that you\r\n",
      "were never in the midst of cold and hunger, and riot and drunkenness,\r\n",
      "and--and--something worse than all--as I have been from my cradle.  I\r\n",
      "may use the word, for the alley and the gutter were mine, as they will\r\n",
      "be my deathbed.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I pity you!' said Rose, in a broken voice.  'It wrings my heart to\r\n",
      "hear you!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Heaven bless you for your goodness!' rejoined the girl. 'If you knew\r\n",
      "what I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed. But I have stolen away\r\n",
      "from those who would surely murder me, if they knew I had been here, to\r\n",
      "tell you what I have overheard.  Do you know a man named Monks?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' said Rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He knows you,' replied the girl; 'and knew you were here, for it was\r\n",
      "by hearing him tell the place that I found you out.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I never heard the name,' said Rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then he goes by some other amongst us,' rejoined the girl, 'which I\r\n",
      "more than thought before.  Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put\r\n",
      "into your house on the night of the robbery, I--suspecting this\r\n",
      "man--listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark.\r\n",
      "I found out, from what I heard, that Monks--the man I asked you about,\r\n",
      "you know--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,' said Rose, 'I understand.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'--That Monks,' pursued the girl, 'had seen him accidently with two of\r\n",
      "our boys on the day we first lost him, and had known him directly to be\r\n",
      "the same child that he was watching for, though I couldn't make out\r\n",
      "why.  A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he\r\n",
      "should have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a\r\n",
      "thief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'For what purpose?' asked Rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of\r\n",
      "finding out,' said the girl; 'and there are not many people besides me\r\n",
      "that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery.  But\r\n",
      "I did; and I saw him no more till last night.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And what occurred then?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'll tell you, lady.  Last night he came again.  Again they went\r\n",
      "upstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray\r\n",
      "me, again listened at the door.  The first words I heard Monks say were\r\n",
      "these:  \"So the only proofs of the boy's identity lie at the bottom of\r\n",
      "the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is\r\n",
      "rotting in her coffin.\"  They laughed, and talked of his success in\r\n",
      "doing this; and Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild,\r\n",
      "said that though he had got the young devil's money safely now, he'd\r\n",
      "rather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have been\r\n",
      "to have brought down the boast of the father's will, by driving him\r\n",
      "through every jail in town, and then hauling him up for some capital\r\n",
      "felony which Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit\r\n",
      "of him besides.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What is all this!' said Rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,' replied the girl.\r\n",
      "'Then, he said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but strange to\r\n",
      "yours, that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy's life\r\n",
      "without bringing his own neck in danger, he would; but, as he couldn't,\r\n",
      "he'd be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life; and if he\r\n",
      "took advantage of his birth and history, he might harm him yet. \"In\r\n",
      "short, Fagin,\" he says, \"Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as\r\n",
      "I'll contrive for my young brother, Oliver.\"'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'His brother!' exclaimed Rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Those were his words,' said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she had\r\n",
      "scarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a vision of Sikes\r\n",
      "haunted her perpetually.  'And more. When he spoke of you and the other\r\n",
      "lady, and said it seemed contrived by Heaven, or the devil, against\r\n",
      "him, that Oliver should come into your hands, he laughed, and said\r\n",
      "there was some comfort in that too, for how many thousands and hundreds\r\n",
      "of thousands of pounds would you not give, if you had them, to know who\r\n",
      "your two-legged spaniel was.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You do not mean,' said Rose, turning very pale, 'to tell me that this\r\n",
      "was said in earnest?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did,' replied the\r\n",
      "girl, shaking her head.  'He is an earnest man when his hatred is up.\r\n",
      "I know many who do worse things; but I'd rather listen to them all a\r\n",
      "dozen times, than to that Monks once.  It is growing late, and I have\r\n",
      "to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as\r\n",
      "this.  I must get back quickly.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'But what can I do?' said Rose.  'To what use can I turn this\r\n",
      "communication without you?  Back!  Why do you wish to return to\r\n",
      "companions you paint in such terrible colors?  If you repeat this\r\n",
      "information to a gentleman whom I can summon in an instant from the\r\n",
      "next room, you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an\r\n",
      "hour's delay.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I wish to go back,' said the girl.  'I must go back, because--how can\r\n",
      "I tell such things to an innocent lady like you?--because among the men\r\n",
      "I have told you of, there is one: the most desperate among them all;\r\n",
      "that I can't leave:  no, not even to be saved from the life I am\r\n",
      "leading now.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Your having interfered in this dear boy's behalf before,' said Rose;\r\n",
      "'your coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you have heard;\r\n",
      "your manner, which convinces me of the truth of what you say; your\r\n",
      "evident contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me to believe that you\r\n",
      "might yet be reclaimed.  Oh!' said the earnest girl, folding her hands\r\n",
      "as the tears coursed down her face, 'do not turn a deaf ear to the\r\n",
      "entreaties of one of your own sex; the first--the first, I do believe,\r\n",
      "who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion.  Do hear\r\n",
      "my words, and let me save you yet, for better things.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Lady,' cried the girl, sinking on her knees, 'dear, sweet, angel lady,\r\n",
      "you _are_ the first that ever blessed me with such words as these, and\r\n",
      "if I had heard them years ago, they might have turned me from a life of\r\n",
      "sin and sorrow; but it is too late, it is too late!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It is never too late,' said Rose, 'for penitence and atonement.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It is,' cried the girl, writhing in agony of her mind; 'I cannot leave\r\n",
      "him now!  I could not be his death.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why should you be?' asked Rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing could save him,' cried the girl.  'If I told others what I\r\n",
      "have told you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure to die.\r\n",
      "He is the boldest, and has been so cruel!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is it possible,' cried Rose, 'that for such a man as this, you can\r\n",
      "resign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue?  It is\r\n",
      "madness.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't know what it is,' answered the girl; 'I only know that it is\r\n",
      "so, and not with me alone, but with hundreds of others as bad and\r\n",
      "wretched as myself.  I must go back.  Whether it is God's wrath for the\r\n",
      "wrong I have done, I do not know; but I am drawn back to him through\r\n",
      "every suffering and ill usage; and I should be, I believe, if I knew\r\n",
      "that I was to die by his hand at last.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What am I to do?' said Rose.  'I should not let you depart from me\r\n",
      "thus.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You should, lady, and I know you will,' rejoined the girl, rising.\r\n",
      "'You will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness,\r\n",
      "and forced no promise from you, as I might have done.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Of what use, then, is the communication you have made?' said Rose.\r\n",
      "'This mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me,\r\n",
      "benefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a\r\n",
      "secret, and advise you what to do,' rejoined the girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'But where can I find you again when it is necessary?' asked Rose.  'I\r\n",
      "do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will\r\n",
      "you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and\r\n",
      "come alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I\r\n",
      "shall not be watched or followed?' asked the girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I promise you solemnly,' answered Rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Every Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,' said\r\n",
      "the girl without hesitation, 'I will walk on London Bridge if I am\r\n",
      "alive.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stay another moment,' interposed Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly\r\n",
      "towards the door.  'Think once again on your own condition, and the\r\n",
      "opportunity you have of escaping from it.  You have a claim on me:  not\r\n",
      "only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence, but as a woman lost\r\n",
      "almost beyond redemption.  Will you return to this gang of robbers, and\r\n",
      "to this man, when a word can save you?  What fascination is it that can\r\n",
      "take you back, and make you cling to wickedness and misery?  Oh! is\r\n",
      "there no chord in your heart that I can touch!  Is there nothing left,\r\n",
      "to which I can appeal against this terrible infatuation!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'When ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,' replied the\r\n",
      "girl steadily, 'give away your hearts, love will carry you all\r\n",
      "lengths--even such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers,\r\n",
      "everything, to fill them.  When such as I, who have no certain roof but\r\n",
      "the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital\r\n",
      "nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place\r\n",
      "that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to\r\n",
      "cure us?  Pity us, lady--pity us for having only one feeling of the\r\n",
      "woman left, and for having that turned, by a heavy judgment, from a\r\n",
      "comfort and a pride, into a new means of violence and suffering.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You will,' said Rose, after a pause, 'take some money from me, which\r\n",
      "may enable you to live without dishonesty--at all events until we meet\r\n",
      "again?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not a penny,' replied the girl, waving her hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,' said\r\n",
      "Rose, stepping gently forward.  'I wish to serve you indeed.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You would serve me best, lady,' replied the girl, wringing her hands,\r\n",
      "'if you could take my life at once; for I have felt more grief to think\r\n",
      "of what I am, to-night, than I ever did before, and it would be\r\n",
      "something not to die in the hell in which I have lived.  God bless you,\r\n",

      "was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing\r\n",
      "for some weeks to a distant part of the coast.  It was now midnight of\r\n",
      "the first day.  What course of action could she determine upon, which\r\n",
      "could be adopted in eight-and-forty hours? Or how could she postpone\r\n",
      "the journey without exciting suspicion?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but\r\n",
      "Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman's\r\n",
      "impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first\r\n",
      "explosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of\r\n",
      "Oliver's recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her\r\n",
      "representations in the girl's behalf could be seconded by no\r\n",
      "experienced person.  These were all reasons for the greatest caution\r\n",
      "and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie,\r\n",
      "whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the\r\n",
      "worthy doctor on the subject.  As to resorting to any legal adviser,\r\n",
      "even if she had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of,\r\n",
      "for the same reason.  Once the thought occurred to her of seeking\r\n",
      "assistance from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last\r\n",
      "parting, and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when--the\r\n",
      "tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection--he\r\n",
      "might have by this time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Disturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course\r\n",
      "and then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive\r\n",
      "consideration presented itself to her mind; Rose passed a sleepless and\r\n",
      "anxious night.  After more communing with herself next day, she arrived\r\n",
      "at the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If it be painful to him,' she thought, 'to come back here, how painful\r\n",
      "it will be to me!  But perhaps he will not come; he may write, or he\r\n",
      "may come himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me--he did when\r\n",
      "he went away.  I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us\r\n",
      "both.'  And here Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the\r\n",
      "very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and\r\n",
      "had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without\r\n",
      "writing the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the\r\n",
      "streets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such\r\n",
      "breathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new\r\n",
      "cause of alarm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What makes you look so flurried?' asked Rose, advancing to meet him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,' replied the boy.\r\n",
      "'Oh dear!  To think that I should see him at last, and you should be\r\n",
      "able to know that I have told you the truth!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I never thought you had told us anything but the truth,' said Rose,\r\n",
      "soothing him.  'But what is this?--of whom do you speak?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I have seen the gentleman,' replied Oliver, scarcely able to\r\n",
      "articulate, 'the gentleman who was so good to me--Mr. Brownlow, that we\r\n",
      "have so often talked about.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Where?' asked Rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Getting out of a coach,' replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight,\r\n",
      "'and going into a house.  I didn't speak to him--I couldn't speak to\r\n",
      "him, for he didn't see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go\r\n",
      "up to him.  But Giles asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they\r\n",
      "said he did.  Look here,' said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, 'here\r\n",
      "it is; here's where he lives--I'm going there directly!  Oh, dear me,\r\n",
      "dear me!  What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak\r\n",
      "again!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many\r\n",
      "other incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was\r\n",
      "Craven Street, in the Strand.  She very soon determined upon turning\r\n",
      "the discovery to account.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Quick!' she said.  'Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready\r\n",
      "to go with me.  I will take you there directly, without a minute's loss\r\n",
      "of time.  I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour,\r\n",
      "and be ready as soon as you are.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five\r\n",
      "minutes they were on their way to Craven Street.  When they arrived\r\n",
      "there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the\r\n",
      "old gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant,\r\n",
      "requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business.  The servant\r\n",
      "soon returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him\r\n",
      "into an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman\r\n",
      "of benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat.  At no great distance\r\n",
      "from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and\r\n",
      "gaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting\r\n",
      "with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin\r\n",
      "propped thereupon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Dear me,' said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily rising\r\n",
      "with great politeness, 'I beg your pardon, young lady--I imagined it\r\n",
      "was some importunate person who--I beg you will excuse me.  Be seated,\r\n",
      "pray.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?' said Rose, glancing from the other\r\n",
      "gentleman to the one who had spoken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That is my name,' said the old gentleman.  'This is my friend, Mr.\r\n",
      "Grimwig.  Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I believe,' interposed Miss Maylie, 'that at this period of our\r\n",
      "interview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away.\r\n",
      "If I am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the business on which I\r\n",
      "wish to speak to you.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brownlow inclined his head.  Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very\r\n",
      "stiff bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and\r\n",
      "dropped into it again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,' said Rose, naturally\r\n",
      "embarrassed; 'but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a\r\n",
      "very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest\r\n",
      "in hearing of him again.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Indeed!' said Mr. Brownlow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oliver Twist you knew him as,' replied Rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been\r\n",
      "affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with\r\n",
      "a great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from his\r\n",
      "features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged\r\n",
      "in a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayed\r\n",
      "so much emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into\r\n",
      "his former attitude, and looking out straight before him emitted a long\r\n",
      "deep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air,\r\n",
      "but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Browlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was not\r\n",
      "expressed in the same eccentric manner.  He drew his chair nearer to\r\n",
      "Miss Maylie's, and said,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the\r\n",
      "question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which\r\n",
      "nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce\r\n",
      "any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once\r\n",
      "induced to entertain of that poor child, in Heaven's name put me in\r\n",
      "possession of it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A bad one!  I'll eat my head if he is not a bad one,' growled Mr.\r\n",
      "Grimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle\r\n",
      "of his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,' said Rose,\r\n",
      "colouring; 'and that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his\r\n",
      "years, has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do\r\n",
      "honour to many who have numbered his days six times over.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'm only sixty-one,' said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face. 'And,\r\n",
      "as the devil's in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least, I\r\n",
      "don't see the application of that remark.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'he does not\r\n",
      "mean what he says.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, he does,' growled Mr. Grimwig.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, he does not,' said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as he\r\n",
      "spoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He'll eat his head, if he doesn't,' growled Mr. Grimwig.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does,' said Mr.\r\n",
      "Brownlow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And he'd uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,' responded Mr.\r\n",
      "Grimwig, knocking his stick upon the floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and\r\n",
      "afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now, Miss Maylie,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'to return to the subject in\r\n",
      "which your humanity is so much interested.  Will you let me know what\r\n",
      "intelligence you have of this poor child:  allowing me to promise that\r\n",
      "I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since\r\n",
      "I have been absent from this country, my first impression that he had\r\n",
      "imposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob\r\n",
      "me, has been considerably shaken.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a\r\n",
      "few natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr.\r\n",
      "Brownlow's house; reserving Nancy's information for that gentleman's\r\n",
      "private ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow,\r\n",
      "for some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former\r\n",
      "benefactor and friend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Thank God!' said the old gentleman.  'This is great happiness to me,\r\n",
      "great happiness.  But you have not told me where he is now, Miss\r\n",
      "Maylie.  You must pardon my finding fault with you,--but why not have\r\n",
      "brought him?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He is waiting in a coach at the door,' replied Rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'At this door!' cried the old gentleman.  With which he hurried out of\r\n",
      "the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach,\r\n",
      "without another word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the room-door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head,\r\n",
      "and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot,\r\n",
      "described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and\r\n",
      "the table; sitting in it all the time.  After performing this\r\n",
      "evolution, he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room\r\n",
      "at least a dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed\r\n",
      "her without the slightest preface.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hush!' he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual\r\n",
      "proceeding.  'Don't be afraid.  I'm old enough to be your grandfather.\r\n",
      "You're a sweet girl.  I like you.  Here they are!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former\r\n",
      "seat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig\r\n",
      "received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had\r\n",
      "been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver's behalf,\r\n",
      "Rose Maylie would have been well repaid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,' said\r\n",
      "Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell.  'Send Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and\r\n",
      "dropping a curtsey at the door, waited for orders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,' said Mr. Brownlow, rather\r\n",
      "testily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, that I do, sir,' replied the old lady.  'People's eyes, at my\r\n",
      "time of life, don't improve with age, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I could have told you that,' rejoined Mr. Brownlow; 'but put on your\r\n",
      "glasses, and see if you can't find out what you were wanted for, will\r\n",
      "you?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles. But\r\n",
      "Oliver's patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to\r\n",
      "his first impulse, he sprang into her arms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'God be good to me!' cried the old lady, embracing him; 'it is my\r\n",
      "innocent boy!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'My dear old nurse!' cried Oliver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He would come back--I knew he would,' said the old lady, holding him\r\n",
      "in her arms.  'How well he looks, and how like a gentleman's son he is\r\n",
      "dressed again!  Where have you been, this long, long while?  Ah! the\r\n",
      "same sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad.  I\r\n",
      "have never forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every\r\n",
      "day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone\r\n",
      "since I was a lightsome young creature.'  Running on thus, and now\r\n",
      "holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to\r\n",
      "her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul\r\n",
      "laughed and wept upon his neck by turns.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led\r\n",
      "the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration\r\n",
      "of her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise\r\n",
      "and perplexity.  Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in\r\n",
      "her friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance.  The old gentleman\r\n",
      "considered that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold\r\n",
      "solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself.  To afford him an\r\n",
      "early opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged\r\n",
      "that he should call at the hotel at eight o'clock that evening, and\r\n",
      "that in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all\r\n",
      "that had occurred.  These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver\r\n",
      "returned home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor's wrath.\r\n",
      "Nancy's history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a\r\n",
      "shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the\r\n",
      "first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff;\r\n",
      "and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the\r\n",
      "assistance of those worthies.  And, doubtless, he would, in this first\r\n",
      "outbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment's\r\n",
      "consideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained, in\r\n",
      "part, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was\r\n",
      "himself of an irascible temperament, and party by such arguments and\r\n",
      "representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his\r\n",
      "hotbrained purpose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then what the devil is to be done?' said the impetuous doctor, when\r\n",
      "they had rejoined the two ladies.  'Are we to pass a vote of thanks to\r\n",
      "all these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred\r\n",
      "pounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some\r\n",
      "slight acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not exactly that,' rejoined Mr. Brownlow, laughing; 'but we must\r\n",
      "proceed gently and with great care.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Gentleness and care,' exclaimed the doctor.  'I'd send them one and\r\n",
      "all to--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Never mind where,' interposed Mr. Brownlow.  'But reflect whether\r\n",
      "sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What object?' asked the doctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Simply, the discovery of Oliver's parentage, and regaining for him the\r\n",
      "inheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been fraudulently\r\n",
      "deprived.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah!' said Mr. Losberne, cooling himself with his pocket-handkerchief;\r\n",
      "'I almost forgot that.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You see,' pursued Mr. Brownlow; 'placing this poor girl entirely out\r\n",
      "of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these\r\n",
      "scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what good should\r\n",
      "we bring about?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hanging a few of them at least, in all probability,' suggested the\r\n",
      "doctor, 'and transporting the rest.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Very good,' replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; 'but no doubt they will\r\n",
      "bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step\r\n",
      "in to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very\r\n",
      "Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest--or at least to\r\n",
      "Oliver's, which is the same thing.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'How?' inquired the doctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Thus.  It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in\r\n",
      "getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man,\r\n",
      "Monks, upon his knees.  That can only be done by stratagem, and by\r\n",
      "catching him when he is not surrounded by these people.  For, suppose\r\n",
      "he were apprehended, we have no proof against him.  He is not even (so\r\n",
      "far as we know, or as the facts appear to us) concerned with the gang\r\n",
      "in any of their robberies. If he were not discharged, it is very\r\n",
      "unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being\r\n",
      "committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever\r\n",
      "afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as\r\n",
      "well, for our purposes, be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then,' said the doctor impetuously, 'I put it to you again, whether\r\n",
      "you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be\r\n",
      "considered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest\r\n",
      "intentions, but really--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,' said Mr.\r\n",
      "Brownlow, interrupting Rose as she was about to speak. 'The promise\r\n",
      "shall be kept.  I don't think it will, in the slightest degree,\r\n",
      "interfere with our proceedings.  But, before we can resolve upon any\r\n",

      "ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the\r\n",
      "understanding that he is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law;\r\n",
      "or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her such an\r\n",
      "account of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us\r\n",
      "to identify him.  She cannot be seen until next Sunday night; this is\r\n",
      "Tuesday.  I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly\r\n",
      "quiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving\r\n",
      "a delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course\r\n",
      "occurred to him just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very\r\n",
      "strongly with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman's proposition was carried\r\n",
      "unanimously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I should like,' he said, 'to call in the aid of my friend Grimwig.  He\r\n",
      "is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of material\r\n",
      "assistance to us; I should say that he was bred a lawyer, and quitted\r\n",
      "the Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of\r\n",
      "course, in twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not,\r\n",
      "you must determine for yourselves.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in\r\n",
      "mine,' said the doctor.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'That lady's son, and this young lady's--very old friend,' said the\r\n",
      "doctor, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie, and concluding with an\r\n",
      "expressive glance at her niece.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this\r\n",
      "motion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and Harry Maylie and\r\n",
      "Mr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We stay in town, of course,' said Mrs. Maylie, 'while there remains\r\n",
      "the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of\r\n",
      "success.  I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the\r\n",
      "object in which we are all so deeply interested, and I am content to\r\n",
      "remain here, if it be for twelve months, so long as you assure me that\r\n",
      "any hope remains.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Good!' rejoined Mr. Brownlow.  'And as I see on the faces about me, a\r\n",
      "disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to\r\n",
      "corroborate Oliver's tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me\r\n",
      "stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may\r\n",
      "deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story.  Believe\r\n",
      "me, I make this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite\r\n",
      "hopes destined never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and\r\n",
      "disappointments already quite numerous enough.  Come!  Supper has been\r\n",
      "announced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will\r\n",
      "have begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his company,\r\n",
      "and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the\r\n",
      "world.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie, and\r\n",

      "by the Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "They were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better described as\r\n",
      "a male and female:  for the former was one of those long-limbed,\r\n",
      "knock-kneed, shambling, bony people, to whom it is difficult to assign\r\n",
      "any precise age,--looking as they do, when they are yet boys, like\r\n",
      "undergrown men, and when they are almost men, like overgrown boys.  The\r\n",
      "woman was young, but of a robust and hardy make, as she need have been\r\n",
      "to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back.\r\n",
      "Her companion was not encumbered with much luggage, as there merely\r\n",
      "dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder, a small parcel\r\n",
      "wrapped in a common handkerchief, and apparently light enough.  This\r\n",
      "circumstance, added to the length of his legs, which were of unusual\r\n",
      "extent, enabled him with much ease to keep some half-dozen paces in\r\n",
      "advance of his companion, to whom he occasionally turned with an\r\n",
      "impatient jerk of the head:  as if reproaching her tardiness, and\r\n",
      "urging her to greater exertion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of any\r\n",

      "passage for the mail-coaches which were whirling out of town, until\r\n",
      "they passed through Highgate archway; when the foremost traveller\r\n",
      "stopped and called impatiently to his companion,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come on, can't yer?  What a lazybones yer are, Charlotte.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's a heavy load, I can tell you,' said the female, coming up, almost\r\n",
      "breathless with fatigue.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Heavy!  What are yer talking about?  What are yer made for?' rejoined\r\n",

      "other shoulder.  'Oh, there yer are, resting again! Well, if yer ain't\r\n",
      "enough to tire anybody's patience out, I don't know what is!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is it much farther?' asked the woman, resting herself against a bank,\r\n",
      "and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Much farther!  Yer as good as there,' said the long-legged tramper,\r\n",
      "pointing out before him.  'Look there!  Those are the lights of London.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'They're a good two mile off, at least,' said the woman despondingly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Never mind whether they're two mile off, or twenty,' said Noah\r\n",
      "Claypole; for he it was; 'but get up and come on, or I'll kick yer, and\r\n",
      "so I give yer notice.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Noah's red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the road\r\n",
      "while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution,\r\n",
      "the woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his\r\n",
      "side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Where do you mean to stop for the night, Noah?' she asked, after they\r\n",
      "had walked a few hundred yards.\r\n",

      "'Near, I hope,' said Charlotte.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, not near,' replied Mr. Claypole.  'There!  Not near; so don't\r\n",
      "think it.'\r\n",

      "'Well, you needn't be so cross,' said his companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A pretty thing it would be, wouldn't it to go and stop at the very\r\n",
      "first public-house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if he come up\r\n",
      "after us, might poke in his old nose, and have us taken back in a cart\r\n",
      "with handcuffs on,' said Mr. Claypole in a jeering tone.  'No!  I shall\r\n",
      "go and lose myself among the narrowest streets I can find, and not stop\r\n",
      "till we come to the very out-of-the-wayest house I can set eyes on.\r\n",
      "'Cod, yer may thanks yer stars I've got a head; for if we hadn't gone,\r\n",
      "at first, the wrong road a purpose, and come back across country, yer'd\r\n",

      "right for being a fool.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I know I ain't as cunning as you are,' replied Charlotte; 'but don't\r\n",
      "put all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up.  You\r\n",
      "would have been if I had been, any way.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,' said Mr. Claypole.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'No; you trusted in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so you\r\n",
      "are,' said the lady, chucking him under the chin, and drawing her arm\r\n",
      "through his.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was indeed the case; but as it was not Mr. Claypole's habit to\r\n",
      "repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody, it should be\r\n",
      "observed, in justice to that gentleman, that he had trusted Charlotte\r\n",
      "to this extent, in order that, if they were pursued, the money might be\r\n",
      "found on her:  which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his\r\n",
      "innocence of any theft, and would greatly facilitate his chances of\r\n",
      "escape.  Of course, he entered at this juncture, into no explanation of\r\n",
      "his motives, and they walked on very lovingly together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In pursuance of this cautious plan, Mr. Claypole went on, without\r\n",
      "halting, until he arrived at the Angel at Islington, where he wisely\r\n",
      "judged, from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles, that\r\n",
      "London began in earnest.  Just pausing to observe which appeared the\r\n",
      "most crowded streets, and consequently the most to be avoided, he\r\n",
      "crossed into Saint John's Road, and was soon deep in the obscurity of\r\n",
      "the intricate and dirty ways, which, lying between Gray's Inn Lane and\r\n",
      "Smithfield, render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst\r\n",
      "that improvement has left in the midst of London.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Through these streets, Noah Claypole walked, dragging Charlotte after\r\n",
      "him; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole\r\n",
      "external character of some small public-house; now jogging on again, as\r\n",
      "some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his\r\n",
      "purpose.  At length, he stopped in front of one, more humble in\r\n",
      "appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen; and, having crossed\r\n",
      "over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement, graciously announced\r\n",
      "his intention of putting up there, for the night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So give us the bundle,' said Noah, unstrapping it from the woman's\r\n",
      "shoulders, and slinging it over his own; 'and don't yer speak, except\r\n",
      "when yer spoke to.  What's the name of the house--t-h-r--three what?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Cripples,' said Charlotte.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Three Cripples,' repeated Noah, 'and a very good sign too.  Now, then!\r\n",
      "Keep close at my heels, and come along.'  With these injunctions, he\r\n",
      "pushed the rattling door with his shoulder, and entered the house,\r\n",
      "followed by his companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his two elbows\r\n",
      "on the counter, was reading a dirty newspaper. He stared very hard at\r\n",
      "Noah, and Noah stared very hard at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If Noah had been attired in his charity-boy's dress, there might have\r\n",
      "been some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide; but as he had\r\n",
      "discarded the coat and badge, and wore a short smock-frock over his\r\n",
      "leathers, there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting\r\n",
      "so much attention in a public-house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is this the Three Cripples?' asked Noah.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That is the dabe of this 'ouse,' replied the Jew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country,\r\n",
      "recommended us here,' said Noah, nudging Charlotte, perhaps to call her\r\n",
      "attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect, and\r\n",
      "perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise.  'We want to sleep here\r\n",
      "to-night.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'b dot certaid you cad,' said Barney, who was the attendant sprite;\r\n",
      "'but I'll idquire.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Show us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer\r\n",
      "while yer inquiring, will yer?' said Noah.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Barney complied by ushering them into a small back-room, and setting\r\n",
      "the required viands before them; having done which, he informed the\r\n",
      "travellers that they could be lodged that night, and left the amiable\r\n",
      "couple to their refreshment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, this back-room was immediately behind the bar, and some steps\r\n",
      "lower, so that any person connected with the house, undrawing a small\r\n",
      "curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the\r\n",
      "last-named apartment, about five feet from its flooring, could not only\r\n",
      "look down upon any guests in the back-room without any great hazard of\r\n",
      "being observed (the glass being in a dark angle of the wall, between\r\n",
      "which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself), but\r\n",
      "could, by applying his ear to the partition, ascertain with tolerable\r\n",
      "distinctness, their subject of conversation.  The landlord of the house\r\n",
      "had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes,\r\n",
      "and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above\r\n",
      "related, when Fagin, in the course of his evening's business, came into\r\n",
      "the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hush!' said Barney:  'stradegers id the next roob.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Strangers!' repeated the old man in a whisper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah!  Ad rub uds too,' added Barney.  'Frob the cuttry, but subthig in\r\n",
      "your way, or I'b bistaked.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mounting a stool, he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass,\r\n",
      "from which secret post he could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from\r\n",
      "the dish, and porter from the pot, and administering homeopathic doses\r\n",
      "of both to Charlotte, who sat patiently by, eating and drinking at his\r\n",
      "pleasure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Aha!' he whispered, looking round to Barney, 'I like that fellow's\r\n",
      "looks.  He'd be of use to us; he knows how to train the girl already.\r\n",
      "Don't make as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and let me hear 'em\r\n",
      "talk--let me hear 'em.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He again applied his eye to the glass, and turning his ear to the\r\n",
      "partition, listened attentively:  with a subtle and eager look upon his\r\n",
      "face, that might have appertained to some old goblin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So I mean to be a gentleman,' said Mr. Claypole, kicking out his legs,\r\n",
      "and continuing a conversation, the commencement of which Fagin had\r\n",
      "arrived too late to hear. 'No more jolly old coffins, Charlotte, but a\r\n",
      "gentleman's life for me:  and, if yer like, yer shall be a lady.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I should like that well enough, dear,' replied Charlotte; 'but tills\r\n",
      "ain't to be emptied every day, and people to get clear off after it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Tills be blowed!' said Mr. Claypole; 'there's more things besides\r\n",
      "tills to be emptied.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What do you mean?' asked his companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Pockets, women's ridicules, houses, mail-coaches, banks!' said Mr.\r\n",
      "Claypole, rising with the porter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'But you can't do all that, dear,' said Charlotte.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I shall look out to get into company with them as can,' replied Noah.\r\n",
      "'They'll be able to make us useful some way or another. Why, you\r\n",
      "yourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and\r\n",
      "deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Lor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!' exclaimed Charlotte,\r\n",
      "imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There, that'll do:  don't yer be too affectionate, in case I'm cross\r\n",
      "with yer,' said Noah, disengaging himself with great gravity.  'I\r\n",
      "should like to be the captain of some band, and have the whopping of\r\n",
      "'em, and follering 'em about, unbeknown to themselves.  That would suit\r\n",
      "me, if there was good profit; and if we could only get in with some\r\n",
      "gentleman of this sort, I say it would be cheap at that twenty-pound\r\n",
      "note you've got,--especially as we don't very well know how to get rid\r\n",
      "of it ourselves.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After expressing this opinion, Mr. Claypole looked into the porter-pot\r\n",
      "with an aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken its contents,\r\n",
      "nodded condescendingly to Charlotte, and took a draught, wherewith he\r\n",
      "appeared greatly refreshed.  He was meditating another, when the sudden\r\n",
      "opening of the door, and the appearance of a stranger, interrupted him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The stranger was Mr. Fagin.  And very amiable he looked, and a very low\r\n",
      "bow he made, as he advanced, and setting himself down at the nearest\r\n",
      "table, ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,' said Fagin,\r\n",
      "rubbing his hands.  'From the country, I see, sir?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'How do yer see that?' asked Noah Claypole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We have not so much dust as that in London,' replied Fagin, pointing\r\n",
      "from Noah's shoes to those of his companion, and from them to the two\r\n",
      "bundles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yer a sharp feller,' said Noah.  'Ha! ha! only hear that, Charlotte!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,' replied the Jew,\r\n",
      "sinking his voice to a confidential whisper; 'and that's the truth.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his\r\n",
      "right forefinger,--a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate, though\r\n",
      "not with complete success, in consequence of his own nose not being\r\n",
      "large enough for the purpose.  However, Mr. Fagin seemed to interpret\r\n",
      "the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion, and\r\n",
      "put about the liquor which Barney reappeared with, in a very friendly\r\n",
      "manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Good stuff that,' observed Mr. Claypole, smacking his lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Dear!' said Fagin.  'A man need be always emptying a till, or a\r\n",
      "pocket, or a woman's reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a bank,\r\n",
      "if he drinks it regularly.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he\r\n",
      "fell back in his chair, and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a\r\n",
      "countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Don't mind me, my dear,' said Fagin, drawing his chair closer. 'Ha!\r\n",
      "ha! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance. It was very\r\n",
      "lucky it was only me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I didn't take it,' stammered Noah, no longer stretching out his legs\r\n",
      "like an independent gentleman, but coiling them up as well as he could\r\n",
      "under his chair; 'it was all her doing; yer've got it now, Charlotte,\r\n",
      "yer know yer have.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No matter who's got it, or who did it, my dear,' replied Fagin,\r\n",
      "glancing, nevertheless, with a hawk's eye at the girl and the two\r\n",
      "bundles.  'I'm in that way myself, and I like you for it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'In what way?' asked Mr. Claypole, a little recovering.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'In that way of business,' rejoined Fagin; 'and so are the people of\r\n",
      "the house.  You've hit the right nail upon the head, and are as safe\r\n",
      "here as you could be.  There is not a safer place in all this town than\r\n",
      "is the Cripples; that is, when I like to make it so.  And I have taken\r\n",
      "a fancy to you and the young woman; so I've said the word, and you may\r\n",
      "make your minds easy.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Noah Claypole's mind might have been at ease after this assurance, but\r\n",
      "his body certainly was not; for he shuffled and writhed about, into\r\n",
      "various uncouth positions:  eyeing his new friend meanwhile with\r\n",
      "mingled fear and suspicion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'll tell you more,' said Fagin, after he had reassured the girl, by\r\n",
      "dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements. 'I have got a friend\r\n",
      "that I think can gratify your darling wish, and put you in the right\r\n",
      "way, where you can take whatever department of the business you think\r\n",
      "will suit you best at first, and be taught all the others.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yer speak as if yer were in earnest,' replied Noah.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What advantage would it be to me to be anything else?' inquired Fagin,\r\n",
      "shrugging his shoulders.  'Here!  Let me have a word with you outside.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There's no occasion to trouble ourselves to move,' said Noah, getting\r\n",
      "his legs by gradual degrees abroad again. 'She'll take the luggage\r\n",
      "upstairs the while.  Charlotte, see to them bundles.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This mandate, which had been delivered with great majesty, was obeyed\r\n",
      "without the slightest demur; and Charlotte made the best of her way off\r\n",
      "with the packages while Noah held the door open and watched her out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She's kept tolerably well under, ain't she?' he asked as he resumed\r\n",
      "his seat:  in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Quite perfect,' rejoined Fagin, clapping him on the shoulder. 'You're\r\n",
      "a genius, my dear.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, I suppose if I wasn't, I shouldn't be here,' replied Noah. 'But,\r\n",
      "I say, she'll be back if yer lose time.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now, what do you think?' said Fagin.  'If you was to like my friend,\r\n",
      "could you do better than join him?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is he in a good way of business; that's where it is!' responded Noah,\r\n",
      "winking one of his little eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best\r\n",
      "society in the profession.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Regular town-maders?' asked Mr. Claypole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not a countryman among 'em; and I don't think he'd take you, even on\r\n",
      "my recommendation, if he didn't run rather short of assistants just\r\n",
      "now,' replied Fagin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Should I have to hand over?' said Noah, slapping his breeches-pocket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It couldn't possibly be done without,' replied Fagin, in a most\r\n",
      "decided manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Twenty pound, though--it's a lot of money!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not when it's in a note you can't get rid of,' retorted Fagin. 'Number\r\n",
      "and date taken, I suppose?  Payment stopped at the Bank? Ah!  It's not\r\n",
      "worth much to him.  It'll have to go abroad, and he couldn't sell it\r\n",
      "for a great deal in the market.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'When could I see him?' asked Noah doubtfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'To-morrow morning.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Where?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Here.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Um!' said Noah.  'What's the wages?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Live like a gentleman--board and lodging, pipes and spirits free--half\r\n",
      "of all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,' replied Mr.\r\n",
      "Fagin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whether Noah Claypole, whose rapacity was none of the least\r\n",
      "comprehensive, would have acceded even to these glowing terms, had he\r\n",
      "been a perfectly free agent, is very doubtful; but as he recollected\r\n",
      "that, in the event of his refusal, it was in the power of his new\r\n",
      "acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately (and more unlikely\r\n",
      "things had come to pass), he gradually relented, and said he thought\r\n",
      "that would suit him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'But, yer see,' observed Noah, 'as she will be able to do a good deal,\r\n",
      "I should like to take something very light.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A little fancy work?' suggested Fagin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah! something of that sort,' replied Noah.  'What do you think would\r\n",
      "suit me now?  Something not too trying for the strength, and not very\r\n",
      "dangerous, you know.  That's the sort of thing!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my\r\n",
      "dear,' said Fagin.  'My friend wants somebody who would do that well,\r\n",
      "very much.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, I did mention that, and I shouldn't mind turning my hand to it\r\n",
      "sometimes,' rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly; 'but it wouldn't pay by\r\n",
      "itself, you know.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's true!' observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to ruminate.\r\n",
      "'No, it might not.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What do you think, then?' asked Noah, anxiously regarding him.\r\n",
      "'Something in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work, and not\r\n",
      "much more risk than being at home.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What do you think of the old ladies?' asked Fagin. 'There's a good\r\n",
      "deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and running\r\n",
      "round the corner.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Don't they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?' asked Noah,\r\n",
      "shaking his head.  'I don't think that would answer my purpose.  Ain't\r\n",
      "there any other line open?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Stop!' said Fagin, laying his hand on Noah's knee.  'The kinchin lay.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's that?' demanded Mr. Claypole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The kinchins, my dear,' said Fagin, 'is the young children that's sent\r\n",
      "on errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings; and the lay\r\n",
      "is just to take their money away--they've always got it ready in their\r\n",
      "hands,--then knock 'em into the kennel, and walk off very slow, as if\r\n",
      "there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt\r\n",
      "itself.  Ha! ha! ha!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ha! ha!' roared Mr. Claypole, kicking up his legs in an ecstasy.\r\n",
      "'Lord, that's the very thing!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'To be sure it is,' replied Fagin; 'and you can have a few good beats\r\n",
      "chalked out in Camden Town, and Battle Bridge, and neighborhoods like\r\n",
      "that, where they're always going errands; and you can upset as many\r\n",
      "kinchins as you want, any hour in the day. Ha! ha! ha!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With this, Fagin poked Mr. Claypole in the side, and they joined in a\r\n",
      "burst of laughter both long and loud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, that's all right!' said Noah, when he had recovered himself, and\r\n",
      "Charlotte had returned.  'What time to-morrow shall we say?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Will ten do?' asked Fagin, adding, as Mr. Claypole nodded assent,\r\n",
      "'What name shall I tell my good friend.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mr. Bolter,' replied Noah, who had prepared himself for such\r\n",
      "emergency.  'Mr. Morris Bolter.  This is Mrs. Bolter.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mrs. Bolter's humble servant,' said Fagin, bowing with grotesque\r\n",
      "politeness.  'I hope I shall know her better very shortly.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do you hear the gentleman, Charlotte?' thundered Mr. Claypole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, Noah, dear!' replied Mrs. Bolter, extending her hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She calls me Noah, as a sort of fond way of talking,' said Mr. Morris\r\n",
      "Bolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin.  'You understand?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh yes, I understand--perfectly,' replied Fagin, telling the truth for\r\n",
      "once.  'Good-night!  Good-night!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With many adieus and good wishes, Mr. Fagin went his way. Noah\r\n",
      "Claypole, bespeaking his good lady's attention, proceeded to enlighten\r\n",
      "her relative to the arrangement he had made, with all that haughtiness\r\n",
      "and air of superiority, becoming, not only a member of the sterner sex,\r\n",
      "but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on\r\n",
      "the kinchin lay, in London and its vicinity.\r\n",

      "WHEREIN IS SHOWN HOW THE ARTFUL DODGER GOT INTO TROUBLE\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And so it was you that was your own friend, was it?' asked Mr.\r\n",
      "Claypole, otherwise Bolter, when, by virtue of the compact entered into\r\n",
      "between them, he had removed next day to Fagin's house.  ''Cod, I\r\n",
      "thought as much last night!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Every man's his own friend, my dear,' replied Fagin, with his most\r\n",
      "insinuating grin.  'He hasn't as good a one as himself anywhere.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Except sometimes,' replied Morris Bolter, assuming the air of a man of\r\n",
      "the world.  'Some people are nobody's enemies but their own, yer know.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Don't believe that,' said Fagin.  'When a man's his own enemy, it's\r\n",
      "only because he's too much his own friend; not because he's careful for\r\n",
      "everybody but himself.  Pooh! pooh!  There ain't such a thing in\r\n",
      "nature.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There oughn't to be, if there is,' replied Mr. Bolter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That stands to reason.  Some conjurers say that number three is the\r\n",
      "magic number, and some say number seven.  It's neither, my friend,\r\n",
      "neither.  It's number one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ha! ha!' cried Mr. Bolter.  'Number one for ever.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'In a little community like ours, my dear,' said Fagin, who felt it\r\n",
      "necessary to qualify this position, 'we have a general number one,\r\n",
      "without considering me too as the same, and all the other young people.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, the devil!' exclaimed Mr. Bolter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You see,' pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption, 'we\r\n",
      "are so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it must\r\n",
      "be so.  For instance, it's your object to take care of number\r\n",
      "one--meaning yourself.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Certainly,' replied Mr. Bolter.  'Yer about right there.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "care of me, number one.'\r\n",

      "'Number two, you mean,' said Mr. Bolter, who was largely endowed with\r\n",
      "the quality of selfishness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, I don't!' retorted Fagin.  'I'm of the same importance to you, as\r\n",
      "you are to yourself.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I say,' interrupted Mr. Bolter, 'yer a very nice man, and I'm very\r\n",
      "fond of yer; but we ain't quite so thick together, as all that comes\r\n",
      "to.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Only think,' said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders, and stretching out\r\n",
      "his hands; 'only consider.  You've done what's a very pretty thing, and\r\n",
      "what I love you for doing; but what at the same time would put the\r\n",
      "cravat round your throat, that's so very easily tied and so very\r\n",
      "difficult to unloose--in plain English, the halter!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bolter put his hand to his neckerchief, as if he felt it\r\n",
      "inconveniently tight; and murmured an assent, qualified in tone but not\r\n",
      "in substance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The gallows,' continued Fagin, 'the gallows, my dear, is an ugly\r\n",

      "stopped many a bold fellow's career on the broad highway.  To keep in\r\n",
      "the easy road, and keep it at a distance, is object number one with\r\n",
      "you.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Of course it is,' replied Mr. Bolter.  'What do yer talk about such\r\n",
      "things for?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Only to show you my meaning clearly,' said the Jew, raising his\r\n",
      "eyebrows.  'To be able to do that, you depend upon me. To keep my\r\n",
      "little business all snug, I depend upon you. The first is your number\r\n",
      "one, the second my number one.  The more you value your number one, the\r\n",
      "more careful you must be of mine; so we come at last to what I told you\r\n",
      "at first--that a regard for number one holds us all together, and must\r\n",
      "do so, unless we would all go to pieces in company.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's true,' rejoined Mr. Bolter, thoughtfully.  'Oh! yer a cunning\r\n",
      "old codger!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was no\r\n",
      "mere compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with a\r\n",
      "sense of his wily genius, which it was most important that he should\r\n",
      "entertain in the outset of their acquaintance.  To strengthen an\r\n",
      "impression so desirable and useful, he followed up the blow by\r\n",
      "acquainting him, in some detail, with the magnitude and extent of his\r\n",
      "operations; blending truth and fiction together, as best served his\r\n",
      "purpose; and bringing both to bear, with so much art, that Mr. Bolter's\r\n",
      "respect visibly increased, and became tempered, at the same time, with\r\n",
      "a degree of wholesome fear, which it was highly desirable to awaken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under\r\n",
      "heavy losses,' said Fagin.  'My best hand was taken from me, yesterday\r\n",
      "morning.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You don't mean to say he died?' cried Mr. Bolter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no,' replied Fagin, 'not so bad as that.  Not quite so bad.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What, I suppose he was--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Wanted,' interposed Fagin.  'Yes, he was wanted.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Very particular?' inquired Mr. Bolter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' replied Fagin, 'not very.  He was charged with attempting to pick\r\n",
      "a pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on him,--his own, my dear,\r\n",
      "his own, for he took snuff himself, and was very fond of it.  They\r\n",
      "remanded him till to-day, for they thought they knew the owner.  Ah! he\r\n",
      "was worth fifty boxes, and I'd give the price of as many to have him\r\n",
      "back.  You should have known the Dodger, my dear; you should have known\r\n",
      "the Dodger.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Bolter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'm doubtful about it,' replied Fagin, with a sigh.  'If they don't\r\n",
      "get any fresh evidence, it'll only be a summary conviction, and we\r\n",
      "shall have him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it's\r\n",
      "a case of lagging.  They know what a clever lad he is; he'll be a\r\n",
      "lifer.  They'll make the Artful nothing less than a lifer.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?' demanded Mr. Bolter. 'What's\r\n",

      "understand yer?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "informed that they represented that combination of words,\r\n",
      "'transportation for life,' when the dialogue was cut short by the entry\r\n",
      "of Master Bates, with his hands in his breeches-pockets, and his face\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'Then what do you talk of?' replied Fagin angrily; 'what are you\r\n",
      "blubbering for?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "''Cause it isn't on the rec-ord, is it?' said Charley, chafed into\r\n",
      "perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets;\r\n",
      "''cause it can't come out in the 'dictment; 'cause nobody will never\r\n",
      "know half of what he was.  How will he stand in the Newgate Calendar?\r\n",
      "P'raps not be there at all.  Oh, my eye, my eye, wot a blow it is!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ha! ha!' cried Fagin, extending his right hand, and turning to Mr.\r\n",
      "Bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the\r\n",
      "palsy; 'see what a pride they take in their profession, my dear.  Ain't\r\n",
      "it beautiful?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bolter nodded assent, and Fagin, after contemplating the grief of\r\n",
      "Charley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to\r\n",
      "that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Never mind, Charley,' said Fagin soothingly; 'it'll come out, it'll be\r\n",
      "sure to come out.  They'll all know what a clever fellow he was; he'll\r\n",
      "show it himself, and not disgrace his old pals and teachers.  Think how\r\n",
      "young he is too!  What a distinction, Charley, to be lagged at his time\r\n",
      "of life!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, it is a honour that is!' said Charley, a little consoled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He shall have all he wants,' continued the Jew.  'He shall be kept in\r\n",
      "the Stone Jug, Charley, like a gentleman.  Like a gentleman!  With his\r\n",
      "beer every day, and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with, if he\r\n",
      "can't spend it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, shall he though?' cried Charley Bates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ay, that he shall,' replied Fagin, 'and we'll have a big-wig, Charley:\r\n",
      "one that's got the greatest gift of the gab:  to carry on his defence;\r\n",
      "and he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes; and we'll read\r\n",
      "it all in the papers--\"Artful Dodger--shrieks of laughter--here the\r\n",
      "court was convulsed\"--eh, Charley, eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ha! ha!' laughed Master Bates, 'what a lark that would be, wouldn't\r\n",
      "it, Fagin?  I say, how the Artful would bother 'em wouldn't he?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Would!' cried Fagin.  'He shall--he will!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah, to be sure, so he will,' repeated Charley, rubbing his hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I think I see him now,' cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his pupil.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So do I,' cried Charley Bates.  'Ha! ha! ha! so do I.  I see it all\r\n",
      "afore me, upon my soul I do, Fagin.  What a game!  What a regular game!\r\n",
      "All the big-wigs trying to look solemn, and Jack Dawkins addressing of\r\n",
      "'em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge's own son making\r\n",
      "a speech arter dinner--ha! ha! ha!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In fact, Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend's eccentric\r\n",
      "disposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to\r\n",
      "consider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim, now\r\n",
      "looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and\r\n",
      "exquisite humour, and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time\r\n",
      "when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of\r\n",
      "displaying his abilities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We must know how he gets on to-day, by some handy means or other,'\r\n",
      "said Fagin.  'Let me think.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Shall I go?' asked Charley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not for the world,' replied Fagin.  'Are you mad, my dear, stark mad,\r\n",
      "that you'd walk into the very place where--No, Charley, no. One is\r\n",
      "enough to lose at a time.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You don't mean to go yourself, I suppose?' said Charley with a\r\n",
      "humorous leer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That wouldn't quite fit,' replied Fagin shaking his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then why don't you send this new cove?' asked Master Bates, laying his\r\n",
      "hand on Noah's arm.  'Nobody knows him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, if he didn't mind--' observed Fagin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Mind!' interposed Charley.  'What should he have to mind?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Really nothing, my dear,' said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter, 'really\r\n",
      "nothing.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, I dare say about that, yer know,' observed Noah, backing towards\r\n",
      "the door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm.  'No,\r\n",
      "no--none of that.  It's not in my department, that ain't.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Wot department has he got, Fagin?' inquired Master Bates, surveying\r\n",
      "Noah's lank form with much disgust.  'The cutting away when there's\r\n",
      "anything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when there's everything\r\n",
      "right; is that his branch?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Never mind,' retorted Mr. Bolter; 'and don't yer take liberties with\r\n",
      "yer superiors, little boy, or yer'll find yerself in the wrong shop.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Master Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it\r\n",
      "was some time before Fagin could interpose, and represent to Mr. Bolter\r\n",
      "that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police-office;\r\n",
      "that, inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had\r\n",
      "engaged, nor any description of his person, had yet been forwarded to\r\n",
      "the metropolis, it was very probable that he was not even suspected of\r\n",
      "having resorted to it for shelter; and that, if he were properly\r\n",
      "disguised, it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in\r\n",
      "London, inasmuch as it would be, of all places, the very last, to which\r\n",
      "he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Persuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much\r\n",
      "greater degree by his fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length consented,\r\n",
      "with a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition. By Fagin's\r\n",
      "directions, he immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner's\r\n",
      "frock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings:  all of which articles\r\n",
      "the Jew had at hand.  He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well\r\n",
      "garnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter's whip.  Thus equipped,\r\n",
      "he was to saunter into the office, as some country fellow from Covent\r\n",
      "Garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his\r\n",
      "curiousity; and as he was as awkward, ungainly, and raw-boned a fellow\r\n",
      "as need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to\r\n",
      "perfection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These arrangements completed, he was informed of the necessary signs\r\n",
      "and tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger, and was conveyed by\r\n",
      "Master Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short\r\n",
      "distance of Bow Street. Having described the precise situation of the\r\n",
      "office, and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk\r\n",
      "straight up the passage, and when he got into the side, and pull off\r\n",
      "his hat as he went into the room, Charley Bates bade him hurry on\r\n",
      "alone, and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Noah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually\r\n",
      "followed the directions he had received, which--Master Bates being\r\n",
      "pretty well acquainted with the locality--were so exact that he was\r\n",
      "enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question,\r\n",
      "or meeting with any interruption by the way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women, who\r\n",
      "were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper end of which\r\n",
      "was a raised platform railed off from the rest, with a dock for the\r\n",
      "prisoners on the left hand against the wall, a box for the witnesses in\r\n",
      "the middle, and a desk for the magistrates on the right; the awful\r\n",
      "locality last named, being screened off by a partition which concealed\r\n",
      "the bench from the common gaze, and left the vulgar to imagine (if they\r\n",
      "could) the full majesty of justice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to\r\n",
      "their admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a\r\n",
      "couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the\r\n",
      "table.  A jailer stood reclining against the dock-rail, tapping his\r\n",
      "nose listlessly with a large key, except when he repressed an undue\r\n",
      "tendency to conversation among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or\r\n",
      "looked sternly up to bid some woman 'Take that baby out,' when the\r\n",
      "gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries, half-smothered in the\r\n",
      "mother's shawl, from some meagre infant.  The room smelt close and\r\n",
      "unwholesome; the walls were dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling\r\n",
      "blackened.  There was an old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf, and a\r\n",
      "dusty clock above the dock--the only thing present, that seemed to go\r\n",
      "on as it ought; for depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance\r\n",
      "with both, had left a taint on all the animate matter, hardly less\r\n",
      "unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that\r\n",
      "frowned upon it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Noah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger; but although there were\r\n",
      "several women who would have done very well for that distinguished\r\n",
      "character's mother or sister, and more than one man who might be\r\n",
      "supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father, nobody at all\r\n",
      "answering the description given him of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen.  He\r\n",
      "waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women,\r\n",
      "being committed for trial, went flaunting out; and then was quickly\r\n",
      "relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once\r\n",
      "could be no other than the object of his visit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with the big\r\n",
      "coat sleeves tucked up as usual, his left hand in his pocket, and his\r\n",
      "hat in his right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait\r\n",
      "altogether indescribable, and, taking his place in the dock, requested\r\n",
      "in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that 'ere disgraceful\r\n",
      "sitivation for.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hold your tongue, will you?' said the jailer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'm an Englishman, ain't I?' rejoined the Dodger.  'Where are my\r\n",
      "priwileges?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You'll get your privileges soon enough,' retorted the jailer, 'and\r\n",
      "pepper with 'em.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We'll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has got to\r\n",
      "say to the beaks, if I don't,' replied Mr. Dawkins.  'Now then!  Wot is\r\n",
      "this here business?  I shall thank the madg'strates to dispose of this\r\n",
      "here little affair, and not to keep me while they read the paper, for\r\n",
      "I've got an appointment with a genelman in the City, and as I am a man\r\n",
      "of my word and wery punctual in business matters, he'll go away if I\r\n",
      "ain't there to my time, and then pr'aps ther won't be an action for\r\n",
      "damage against them as kep me away.  Oh no, certainly not!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this point, the Dodger, with a show of being very particular with a\r\n",
      "view to proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the jailer to\r\n",
      "communicate 'the names of them two files as was on the bench.'  Which\r\n",
      "so tickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as\r\n",
      "Master Bates could have done if he had heard the request.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Silence there!' cried the jailer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What is this?' inquired one of the magistrates.\r\n",

      "'A pick-pocketing case, your worship.'\r\n",

      "'Has the boy ever been here before?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He ought to have been, a many times,' replied the jailer. 'He has been\r\n",
      "pretty well everywhere else.  _I_ know him well, your worship.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh! you know me, do you?' cried the Artful, making a note of the\r\n",
      "statement.  'Wery good.  That's a case of deformation of character, any\r\n",
      "way.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here there was another laugh, and another cry of silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now then, where are the witnesses?' said the clerk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah! that's right,' added the Dodger.  'Where are they?  I should like\r\n",
      "to see 'em.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped forward\r\n",
      "who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in\r\n",
      "a crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, which, being a very\r\n",
      "old one, he deliberately put back again, after trying it on his own\r\n",
      "countenance.  For this reason, he took the Dodger into custody as soon\r\n",
      "as he could get near him, and the said Dodger, being searched, had upon\r\n",
      "his person a silver snuff-box, with the owner's name engraved upon the\r\n",
      "lid.  This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court\r\n",
      "Guide, and being then and there present, swore that the snuff-box was\r\n",
      "his, and that he had missed it on the previous day, the moment he had\r\n",
      "disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to.  He had also\r\n",
      "remarked a young gentleman in the throng, particularly active in making\r\n",
      "his way about, and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Have you anything to ask this witness, boy?' said the magistrate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I wouldn't abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with\r\n",

      "jailer, nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I beg your pardon,' said the Dodger, looking up with an air of\r\n",
      "abstraction.  'Did you redress yourself to me, my man?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I never see such an out-and-out young wagabond, your worship,'\r\n",
      "observed the officer with a grin.  'Do you mean to say anything, you\r\n",
      "young shaver?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' replied the Dodger, 'not here, for this ain't the shop for\r\n",

      "with the Wice President of the House of Commons; but I shall have\r\n",
      "something to say elsewhere, and so will he, and so will a wery numerous\r\n",
      "and 'spectable circle of acquaintance as'll make them beaks wish they'd\r\n",
      "never been born, or that they'd got their footmen to hang 'em up to\r\n",
      "their own hat-pegs, afore they let 'em come out this morning to try it\r\n",
      "on upon me.  I'll--'\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'Come on,' said the jailer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh ah!  I'll come on,' replied the Dodger, brushing his hat with the\r\n",
      "palm of his hand.  'Ah! (to the Bench) it's no use your looking\r\n",
      "frightened; I won't show you no mercy, not a ha'porth of it.  _You'll_\r\n",
      "pay for this, my fine fellers.  I wouldn't be you for something!  I\r\n",
      "wouldn't go free, now, if you was to fall down on your knees and ask\r\n",
      "me.  Here, carry me off to prison!  Take me away!'\r\n",

      "With these last words, the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the\r\n",
      "collar; threatening, till he got into the yard, to make a parliamentary\r\n",

      "Having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell, Noah made the\r\n",

      "prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully\r\n",
      "abroad from a snug retreat, and ascertained that his new friend had not\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched, and listened\r\n",
      "too.  Eleven.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "'Does you good, does it!' cried Sikes.  'Well, so be it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "said Fagin, determined not to be offended.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Reminds me of being nabbed by the devil,' returned Sikes. 'There never\r\n",
      "was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your father,\r\n",
      "and I suppose _he_ is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time,\r\n",

      "sleeve, pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of\r\n",
      "the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving\r\n",
      "the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hallo!' cried Sikes.  'Nance.  Where's the gal going to at this time\r\n",
      "of night?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not far.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'I don't know where,' replied the girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then I do,' said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than because\r\n",
      "he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed.\r\n",
      "'Nowhere.  Sit down.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'm not well.  I told you that before,' rejoined the girl.  'I want a\r\n",
      "breath of air.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Put your head out of the winder,' replied Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There's not enough there,' said the girl.  'I want it in the street.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "locked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet from her\r\n",
      "head, flung it up to the top of an old press.  'There,' said the\r\n",
      "robber.  'Now stop quietly where you are, will you?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me,' said the girl\r\n",
      "turning very pale.  'What do you mean, Bill?  Do you know what you're\r\n",
      "doing?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Know what I'm--Oh!' cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, 'she's out of her\r\n",
      "senses, you know, or she daren't talk to me in that way.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You'll drive me on the something desperate,' muttered the girl placing\r\n",
      "both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some\r\n",
      "violent outbreak.  'Let me go, will you,--this minute--this instant.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No!' said Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Tell him to let me go, Fagin.  He had better.  It'll be better for\r\n",
      "him.  Do you hear me?' cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hear you!' repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her.\r\n",
      "'Aye!  And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have\r\n",
      "such a grip on your throat as'll tear some of that screaming voice out.\r\n",
      "Wot has come over you, you jade!  Wot is it?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Let me go,' said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting herself\r\n",
      "down on the floor, before the door, she said, 'Bill, let me go; you\r\n",
      "don't know what you are doing. You don't, indeed.  For only one\r\n",
      "hour--do--do!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Cut my limbs off one by one!' cried Sikes, seizing her roughly by the\r\n",
      "arm, 'If I don't think the gal's stark raving mad.  Get up.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not till you let me go--not till you let me go--Never--never!'\r\n",
      "screamed the girl.  Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his\r\n",
      "opportunity, and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, struggling\r\n",
      "and wrestling with him by the way, into a small room adjoining, where\r\n",
      "he sat himself on a bench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her\r\n",
      "down by force.  She struggled and implored by turns until twelve\r\n",
      "o'clock had struck, and then, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest\r\n",
      "the point any further.  With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make\r\n",
      "no more efforts to go out that night, Sikes left her to recover at\r\n",
      "leisure and rejoined Fagin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Whew!' said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face.\r\n",
      "'Wot a precious strange gal that is!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You may say that, Bill,' replied Fagin thoughtfully.  'You may say\r\n",
      "that.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Wot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for, do you\r\n",
      "think?' asked Sikes.  'Come; you should know her better than me. Wot\r\n",
      "does it mean?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Obstinacy; woman's obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, I suppose it is,' growled Sikes.  'I thought I had tamed her,\r\n",
      "but she's as bad as ever.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Worse,' said Fagin thoughtfully.  'I never knew her like this, for\r\n",
      "such a little cause.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nor I,' said Sikes.  'I think she's got a touch of that fever in her\r\n",
      "blood yet, and it won't come out--eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Like enough.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I'll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if she's\r\n",
      "took that way again,' said Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was stretched\r\n",
      "on my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself\r\n",
      "aloof,' said Sikes.  'We was poor too, all the time, and I think, one\r\n",
      "way or other, it's worried and fretted her; and that being shut up here\r\n",
      "so long has made her restless--eh?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's it, my dear,' replied the Jew in a whisper.  'Hush!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed her\r\n",
      "former seat.  Her eyes were swollen and red; she rocked herself to and\r\n",
      "fro; tossed her head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, now she's on the other tack!' exclaimed Sikes, turning a look of\r\n",
      "excessive surprise on his companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a few\r\n",
      "minutes, the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour. Whispering\r\n",
      "Sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin took up his hat\r\n",
      "and bade him good-night.  He paused when he reached the room-door, and\r\n",
      "looking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Light him down,' said Sikes, who was filling his pipe. 'It's a pity he\r\n",
      "should break his neck himself, and disappoint the sight-seers.  Show\r\n",
      "him a light.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nancy followed the old man downstairs, with a candle.  When they\r\n",
      "reached the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close\r\n",
      "to the girl, said, in a whisper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What is it, Nancy, dear?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What do you mean?' replied the girl, in the same tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The reason of all this,' replied Fagin.  'If _he_'--he pointed with\r\n",
      "his skinny fore-finger up the stairs--'is so hard with you (he's a\r\n",
      "brute, Nance, a brute-beast), why don't you--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well?' said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost touching\r\n",
      "her ear, and his eyes looking into hers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No matter just now.  We'll talk of this again.  You have a friend in\r\n",
      "me, Nance; a staunch friend.  I have the means at hand, quiet and\r\n",
      "close.  If you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog--like a\r\n",
      "dog!  worse than his dog, for he humours him sometimes--come to me.  I\r\n",
      "say, come to me.  He is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of\r\n",
      "old, Nance.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I know you well,' replied the girl, without manifesting the least\r\n",
      "emotion.  'Good-night.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said\r\n",
      "good-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look\r\n",
      "with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fagin walked towards his home, intent upon the thoughts that were\r\n",
      "working within his brain.  He had conceived the idea--not from what had\r\n",
      "just passed though that had tended to confirm him, but slowly and by\r\n",
      "degrees--that Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker's brutality, had\r\n",
      "conceived an attachment for some new friend.  Her altered manner, her\r\n",
      "repeated absences from home alone, her comparative indifference to the\r\n",
      "interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous, and,\r\n",
      "added to these, her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a\r\n",
      "particular hour, all favoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him\r\n",
      "at least, almost matter of certainty.  The object of this new liking\r\n",
      "was not among his myrmidons.  He would be a valuable acquisition with\r\n",
      "such an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be secured\r\n",
      "without delay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was another, and a darker object, to be gained.  Sikes knew too\r\n",
      "much, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the\r\n",
      "wounds were hidden.  The girl must know, well, that if she shook him\r\n",
      "off, she could never be safe from his fury, and that it would be surely\r\n",
      "wreaked--to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life--on the\r\n",
      "object of her more recent fancy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'With a little persuasion,' thought Fagin, 'what more likely than that\r\n",
      "she would consent to poison him?  Women have done such things, and\r\n",
      "worse, to secure the same object before now.  There would be the\r\n",
      "dangerous villain:  the man I hate:  gone; another secured in his\r\n",
      "place; and my influence over the girl, with a knowledge of this crime\r\n",
      "to back it, unlimited.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he\r\n",
      "sat alone, in the housebreaker's room; and with them uppermost in his\r\n",
      "thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of\r\n",
      "sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting.  There\r\n",
      "was no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to\r\n",
      "understand his meaning.  The girl clearly comprehended it.  Her glance\r\n",
      "at parting showed _that_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and\r\n",
      "that was one of the chief ends to be attained. 'How,' thought Fagin, as\r\n",
      "he crept homeward, 'can I increase my influence with her?  What new\r\n",
      "power can I acquire?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such brains are fertile in expedients.  If, without extracting a\r\n",
      "confession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her\r\n",
      "altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes (of\r\n",
      "whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs,\r\n",
      "could he not secure her compliance?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I can,' said Fagin, almost aloud.  'She durst not refuse me then.  Not\r\n",
      "for her life, not for her life!  I have it all.  The means are ready,\r\n",
      "and shall be set to work.  I shall have you yet!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards\r\n",
      "the spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went on his way:\r\n",
      "busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment, which he\r\n",
      "wrenched tightly in his grasp, as though there were a hated enemy\r\n",

      "length before a public-house, which Noah recognised as the same in\r\n",
      "which he had slept, on the night of his arrival in London.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was past eleven o'clock, and the door was closed.  It opened softly\r\n",
      "on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered, without noise;\r\n",
      "and the door was closed behind them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'Stay there,' whispered Fagin.  He signed to Barney, who withdrew.  In\r\n",

      "snuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking\r\n",

      "considered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the\r\n",
      "better to observe her motions. She looked nervously round, twice or\r\n",
      "thrice, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind\r\n",
      "her, pass on.  She seemed to gather courage as she advanced, and to\r\n",

      "The church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures\r\n",
      "emerged on London Bridge.  One, which advanced with a swift and rapid\r\n",
      "step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in\r\n",
      "quest of some expected object; the other figure was that of a man, who\r\n",
      "slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find, and, at some distance,\r\n",
      "accommodated his pace to hers:  stopping when she stopped:  and as she\r\n",
      "moved again, creeping stealthily on:  but never allowing himself, in\r\n",
      "the ardour of his pursuit, to gain upon her footsteps.  Thus, they\r\n",
      "crossed the bridge, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the\r\n",
      "woman, apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the\r\n",
      "foot-passengers, turned back.  The movement was sudden; but he who\r\n",
      "watched her, was not thrown off his guard by it; for, shrinking into\r\n",
      "one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge, and leaning\r\n",
      "over the parapet the better to conceal his figure, he suffered her to\r\n",
      "pass on the opposite pavement. When she was about the same distance in\r\n",
      "advance as she had been before, he slipped quietly down, and followed\r\n",
      "her again. At nearly the centre of the bridge, she stopped.  The man\r\n",
      "stopped too.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a very dark night.  The day had been unfavourable, and at that\r\n",
      "hour and place there were few people stirring. Such as there were,\r\n",
      "hurried quickly past:  very possibly without seeing, but certainly\r\n",
      "without noticing, either the woman, or the man who kept her in view.\r\n",
      "Their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards\r\n",
      "of such of London's destitute population, as chanced to take their way\r\n",
      "over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless\r\n",
      "hovel wherein to lay their heads; they stood there in silence:  neither\r\n",
      "speaking nor spoken to, by any one who passed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that\r\n",
      "burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and\r\n",
      "rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks.\r\n",
      "The old smoke-stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull\r\n",
      "from the dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water\r\n",
      "too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes. The tower of old\r\n",
      "Saint Saviour's Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the\r\n",
      "giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom; but the\r\n",
      "forest of shipping below bridge, and the thickly scattered spires of\r\n",
      "churches above, were nearly all hidden from sight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro--closely watched\r\n",
      "meanwhile by her hidden observer--when the heavy bell of St. Paul's\r\n",
      "tolled for the death of another day.  Midnight had come upon the\r\n",
      "crowded city.  The palace, the night-cellar, the jail, the madhouse:\r\n",
      "the chambers of birth and death, of health and sickness, the rigid face\r\n",
      "of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child:  midnight was upon them\r\n",
      "all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by\r\n",
      "a grey-haired gentleman, alighted from a hackney-carriage within a\r\n",
      "short distance of the bridge, and, having dismissed the vehicle, walked\r\n",
      "straight towards it.  They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement,\r\n",
      "when the girl started, and immediately made towards them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons who\r\n",
      "entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of\r\n",
      "being realised, when they were suddenly joined by this new associate.\r\n",
      "They halted with an exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it\r\n",
      "immediately; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close\r\n",
      "up--brushed against them, indeed--at that precise moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not here,' said Nancy hurriedly, 'I am afraid to speak to you here.\r\n",
      "Come away--out of the public road--down the steps yonder!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the direction\r\n",
      "in which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and\r\n",
      "roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the\r\n",
      "Surrey bank, and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour's\r\n",
      "Church, form a landing-stairs from the river.  To this spot, the man\r\n",
      "bearing the appearance of a countryman, hastened unobserved; and after\r\n",
      "a moment's survey of the place, he began to descend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights.\r\n",
      "Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the\r\n",
      "left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames.\r\n",
      "At this point the lower steps widen:  so that a person turning that\r\n",
      "angle of the wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs\r\n",
      "who chance to be above him, if only a step. The countryman looked\r\n",
      "hastily round, when he reached this point; and as there seemed no\r\n",
      "better place of concealment, and, the tide being out, there was plenty\r\n",
      "of room, he slipped aside, with his back to the pilaster, and there\r\n",
      "waited:  pretty certain that they would come no lower, and that even if\r\n",
      "he could not hear what was said, he could follow them again, with\r\n",
      "safety.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the\r\n",
      "spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he\r\n",
      "had been led to expect, that he more than once gave the matter up for\r\n",
      "lost, and persuaded himself, either that they had stopped far above, or\r\n",
      "had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious\r\n",
      "conversation.  He was on the point of emerging from his hiding-place,\r\n",
      "and regaining the road above, when he heard the sound of footsteps, and\r\n",
      "directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely\r\n",
      "breathing, listened attentively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This is far enough,' said a voice, which was evidently that of the\r\n",
      "gentleman.  'I will not suffer the young lady to go any farther.  Many\r\n",
      "people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far, but\r\n",
      "you see I am willing to humour you.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'To humour me!' cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed.\r\n",
      "'You're considerate, indeed, sir.  To humour me!  Well, well, it's no\r\n",
      "matter.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, for what,' said the gentleman in a kinder tone, 'for what purpose\r\n",
      "can you have brought us to this strange place?  Why not have let me\r\n",
      "speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something\r\n",
      "stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I told you before,' replied Nancy, 'that I was afraid to speak to you\r\n",
      "there.  I don't know why it is,' said the girl, shuddering, 'but I have\r\n",
      "such a fear and dread upon me to-night that I can hardly stand.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A fear of what?' asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I scarcely know of what,' replied the girl.  'I wish I did. Horrible\r\n",
      "thoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and a fear that\r\n",
      "has made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day.  I was\r\n",
      "reading a book to-night, to wile the time away, and the same things\r\n",
      "came into the print.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Imagination,' said the gentleman, soothing her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No imagination,' replied the girl in a hoarse voice. 'I'll swear I saw\r\n",
      "\"coffin\" written in every page of the book in large black\r\n",
      "letters,--aye, and they carried one close to me, in the streets\r\n",
      "to-night.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There is nothing unusual in that,' said the gentleman. 'They have\r\n",
      "passed me often.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'_Real ones_,' rejoined the girl.  'This was not.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was something so uncommon in her manner, that the flesh of the\r\n",
      "concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words, and\r\n",
      "the blood chilled within him.  He had never experienced a greater\r\n",
      "relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged\r\n",
      "her to be calm, and not allow herself to become the prey of such\r\n",
      "fearful fancies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Speak to her kindly,' said the young lady to her companion. 'Poor\r\n",
      "creature!  She seems to need it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me\r\n",
      "as I am to-night, and preached of flames and vengeance,' cried the\r\n",
      "girl.  'Oh, dear lady, why ar'n't those who claim to be God's own folks\r\n",
      "as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you, who, having youth,\r\n",
      "and beauty, and all that they have lost, might be a little proud\r\n",
      "instead of so much humbler?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Ah!' said the gentleman.  'A Turk turns his face, after washing it\r\n",
      "well, to the East, when he says his prayers; these good people, after\r\n",
      "giving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles\r\n",
      "off, turn with no less regularity, to the darkest side of Heaven.\r\n",
      "Between the Mussulman and the Pharisee, commend me to the first!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were\r\n",
      "perhaps uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover\r\n",
      "herself.  The gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You were not here last Sunday night,' he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I couldn't come,' replied Nancy; 'I was kept by force.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'By whom?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Him that I told the young lady of before.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on\r\n",
      "the subject which has brought us here to-night, I hope?' asked the old\r\n",
      "gentleman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' replied the girl, shaking her head.  'It's not very easy for me\r\n",
      "to leave him unless he knows why; I couldn't give him a drink of\r\n",
      "laudanum before I came away.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Did he awake before you returned?' inquired the gentleman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No; and neither he nor any of them suspect me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Good,' said the gentleman.  'Now listen to me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I am ready,' replied the girl, as he paused for a moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This young lady,' the gentleman began, 'has communicated to me, and to\r\n",
      "some other friends who can be safely trusted, what you told her nearly\r\n",
      "a fortnight since.  I confess to you that I had doubts, at first,\r\n",
      "whether you were to be implicitly relied upon, but now I firmly believe\r\n",
      "you are.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I am,' said the girl earnestly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I repeat that I firmly believe it.  To prove to you that I am disposed\r\n",
      "to trust you, I tell you without reserve, that we propose to extort the\r\n",
      "secret, whatever it may be, from the fear of this man Monks.  But\r\n",
      "if--if--' said the gentleman, 'he cannot be secured, or, if secured,\r\n",
      "cannot be acted upon as we wish, you must deliver up the Jew.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Fagin,' cried the girl, recoiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That man must be delivered up by you,' said the gentleman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I will not do it!  I will never do it!' replied the girl. 'Devil that\r\n",
      "he is, and worse than devil as he has been to me, I will never do that.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You will not?' said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for this\r\n",
      "answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Never!' returned the girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Tell me why?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'For one reason,' rejoined the girl firmly, 'for one reason, that the\r\n",
      "lady knows and will stand by me in, I know she will, for I have her\r\n",
      "promise:  and for this other reason, besides, that, bad life as he has\r\n",
      "led, I have led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the\r\n",
      "same courses together, and I'll not turn upon them, who might--any of\r\n",
      "them--have turned upon me, but didn't, bad as they are.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then,' said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the point he\r\n",
      "had been aiming to attain; 'put Monks into my hands, and leave him to\r\n",
      "me to deal with.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What if he turns against the others?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him,\r\n",
      "there the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver's\r\n",
      "little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye,\r\n",
      "and if the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And if it is not?' suggested the girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Then,' pursued the gentleman, 'this Fagin shall not be brought to\r\n",
      "justice without your consent.  In such a case I could show you reasons,\r\n",
      "I think, which would induce you to yield it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Have I the lady's promise for that?' asked the girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You have,' replied Rose.  'My true and faithful pledge.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?' said the girl,\r\n",
      "after a short pause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Never,' replied the gentleman.  'The intelligence should be brought to\r\n",
      "bear upon him, that he could never even guess.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I have been a liar, and among liars from a little child,' said the\r\n",
      "girl after another interval of silence, 'but I will take your words.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After receiving an assurance from both, that she might safely do so,\r\n",
      "she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the\r\n",
      "listener to discover even the purport of what she said, to describe, by\r\n",
      "name and situation, the public-house whence she had been followed that\r\n",
      "night.  From the manner in which she occasionally paused, it appeared\r\n",
      "as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she\r\n",
      "communicated.  When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the\r\n",
      "place, the best position from which to watch it without exciting\r\n",
      "observation, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the\r\n",
      "habit of frequenting it, she seemed to consider for a few moments, for\r\n",
      "the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to\r\n",
      "her recollection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He is tall,' said the girl, 'and a strongly made man, but not stout;\r\n",
      "he has a lurking walk; and as he walks, constantly looks over his\r\n",
      "shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other. Don't forget that,\r\n",
      "for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man's,\r\n",
      "that you might almost tell him by that alone.  His face is dark, like\r\n",
      "his hair and eyes; and, although he can't be more than six or eight and\r\n",
      "twenty, withered and haggard. His lips are often discoloured and\r\n",
      "disfigured with the marks of teeth; for he has desperate fits, and\r\n",
      "sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds--why did you\r\n",
      "start?' said the girl, stopping suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he was not conscious\r\n",
      "of having done so, and begged her to proceed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Part of this,' said the girl, 'I have drawn out from other people at\r\n",
      "the house I tell you of, for I have only seen him twice, and both times\r\n",
      "he was covered up in a large cloak.  I think that's all I can give you\r\n",
      "to know him by.  Stay though,' she added.  'Upon his throat:  so high\r\n",
      "that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his\r\n",
      "face:  there is--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A broad red mark, like a burn or scald?' cried the gentleman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'How's this?' said the girl.  'You know him!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they\r\n",
      "were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I think I do,' said the gentleman, breaking silence.  'I should by\r\n",
      "your description.  We shall see.  Many people are singularly like each\r\n",
      "other.  It may not be the same.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he expressed himself to this effect, with assumed carelessness, he\r\n",
      "took a step or two nearer the concealed spy, as the latter could tell\r\n",
      "from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter, 'It must be he!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Now,' he said, returning:  so it seemed by the sound:  to the spot\r\n",
      "where he had stood before, 'you have given us most valuable assistance,\r\n",
      "young woman, and I wish you to be the better for it. What can I do to\r\n",
      "serve you?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing,' replied Nancy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You will not persist in saying that,' rejoined the gentleman, with a\r\n",
      "voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder\r\n",
      "and more obdurate heart. 'Think now.  Tell me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing, sir,' rejoined the girl, weeping.  'You can do nothing to\r\n",
      "help me.  I am past all hope, indeed.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You put yourself beyond its pale,' said the gentleman. 'The past has\r\n",
      "been a dreary waste with you, of youthful energies mis-spent, and such\r\n",
      "priceless treasures lavished, as the Creator bestows but once and never\r\n",
      "grants again, but, for the future, you may hope. I do not say that it\r\n",
      "is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must\r\n",
      "come as you seek it; but a quiet asylum, either in England, or, if you\r\n",
      "fear to remain here, in some foreign country, it is not only within the\r\n",
      "compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you. Before\r\n",
      "the dawn of morning, before this river wakes to the first glimpse of\r\n",
      "day-light, you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your\r\n",
      "former associates, and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind\r\n",
      "you, as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment.  Come!  I\r\n",
      "would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion,\r\n",
      "or take one look at any old haunt, or breathe the very air which is\r\n",
      "pestilence and death to you.  Quit them all, while there is time and\r\n",
      "opportunity!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'She will be persuaded now,' cried the young lady.  'She hesitates, I\r\n",
      "am sure.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I fear not, my dear,' said the gentleman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No sir, I do not,' replied the girl, after a short struggle.  'I am\r\n",
      "chained to my old life.  I loathe and hate it now, but I cannot leave\r\n",
      "it.  I must have gone too far to turn back,--and yet I don't know, for\r\n",
      "if you had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it\r\n",
      "off.  But,' she said, looking hastily round, 'this fear comes over me\r\n",
      "again.  I must go home.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Home!' repeated the young lady, with great stress upon the word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Home, lady,' rejoined the girl.  'To such a home as I have raised for\r\n",
      "myself with the work of my whole life.  Let us part. I shall be watched\r\n",
      "or seen.  Go!  Go!  If I have done you any service all I ask is, that\r\n",
      "you leave me, and let me go my way alone.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It is useless,' said the gentleman, with a sigh.  'We compromise her\r\n",
      "safety, perhaps, by staying here.  We may have detained her longer than\r\n",
      "she expected already.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, yes,' urged the girl. 'You have.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What,' cried the young lady, 'can be the end of this poor creature's\r\n",
      "life!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What!' repeated the girl.  'Look before you, lady.  Look at that dark\r\n",
      "water.  How many times do you read of such as I who spring into the\r\n",
      "tide, and leave no living thing, to care for, or bewail them.  It may\r\n",
      "be years hence, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at\r\n",
      "last.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do not speak thus, pray,' returned the young lady, sobbing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It will never reach your ears, dear lady, and God forbid such horrors\r\n",
      "should!' replied the girl.  'Good-night, good-night!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The gentleman turned away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This purse,' cried the young lady.  'Take it for my sake, that you may\r\n",
      "have some resource in an hour of need and trouble.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No!' replied the girl.  'I have not done this for money.  Let me have\r\n",
      "that to think of.  And yet--give me something that you have worn:  I\r\n",
      "should like to have something--no, no, not a ring--your gloves or\r\n",
      "handkerchief--anything that I can keep, as having belonged to you,\r\n",
      "sweet lady.  There.  Bless you!  God bless you. Good-night, good-night!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The violent agitation of the girl, and the apprehension of some\r\n",
      "discovery which would subject her to ill-usage and violence, seemed to\r\n",
      "determine the gentleman to leave her, as she requested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards\r\n",
      "appeared upon the bridge.  They stopped at the summit of the stairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hark!' cried the young lady, listening.  'Did she call!  I thought I\r\n",
      "heard her voice.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, my love,' replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back. 'She has not\r\n",
      "moved, and will not till we are gone.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rose Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her arm through his,\r\n",
      "and led her, with gentle force, away.  As they disappeared, the girl\r\n",
      "sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs, and\r\n",
      "vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a time she arose, and with feeble and tottering steps ascended\r\n",
      "the street.  The astonished listener remained motionless on his post\r\n",
      "for some minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many cautious\r\n",
      "glances round him, that he was again alone, crept slowly from his\r\n",
      "hiding-place, and returned, stealthily and in the shade of the wall, in\r\n",
      "the same manner as he had descended.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Peeping out, more than once, when he reached the top, to make sure that\r\n",
      "he was unobserved, Noah Claypole darted away at his utmost speed, and\r\n",
      "made for the Jew's house as fast as his legs would carry him.\r\n",

      "It was nearly two hours before day-break; that time which in the autumn\r\n",
      "of the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets\r\n",
      "are silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and\r\n",
      "profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream; it was at this still\r\n",
      "and silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his old lair, with face so\r\n",
      "distorted and pale, and eyes so red and blood-shot, that he looked less\r\n",
      "like a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and\r\n",
      "worried by an evil spirit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet,\r\n",
      "with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table\r\n",
      "by his side.  His right hand was raised to his lips, and as, absorbed\r\n",
      "in thought, he hit his long black nails, he disclosed among his\r\n",
      "toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog's or rat's.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep.\r\n",
      "Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant, and\r\n",
      "then brought them back again to the candle; which with a long-burnt\r\n",
      "wick drooping almost double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon\r\n",
      "the table, plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Indeed they were.  Mortification at the overthrow of his notable\r\n",
      "scheme; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and\r\n",
      "utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up; bitter\r\n",
      "disappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes; the fear of\r\n",
      "detection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by\r\n",
      "all; these were the passionate considerations which, following close\r\n",
      "upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain\r\n",
      "of Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his\r\n",
      "heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He sat without changing his attitude in the least, or appearing to take\r\n",
      "the smallest heed of time, until his quick ear seemed to be attracted\r\n",
      "by a footstep in the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'At last,' he muttered, wiping his dry and fevered mouth. 'At last!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The bell rang gently as he spoke.  He crept upstairs to the door, and\r\n",
      "presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who\r\n",
      "carried a bundle under one arm. Sitting down and throwing back his\r\n",
      "outer coat, the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There!' he said, laying the bundle on the table.  'Take care of that,\r\n",
      "and do the most you can with it.  It's been trouble enough to get; I\r\n",
      "thought I should have been here, three hours ago.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard,\r\n",
      "sat down again without speaking.  But he did not take his eyes off the\r\n",
      "robber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over\r\n",
      "against each other, face to face, he looked fixedly at him, with his\r\n",
      "lips quivering so violently, and his face so altered by the emotions\r\n",
      "which had mastered him, that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back\r\n",
      "his chair, and surveyed him with a look of real affright.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Wot now?' cried Sikes.  'Wot do you look at a man so for?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the\r\n",
      "air; but his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the\r\n",
      "moment gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Damme!' said Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm. 'He's\r\n",
      "gone mad.  I must look to myself here.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no,' rejoined Fagin, finding his voice.  'It's not--you're not the\r\n",
      "person, Bill.  I've no--no fault to find with you.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh, you haven't, haven't you?' said Sikes, looking sternly at him, and\r\n",
      "ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket.  'That's\r\n",
      "lucky--for one of us.  Which one that is, don't matter.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I've got that to tell you, Bill,' said Fagin, drawing his chair\r\n",
      "nearer, 'will make you worse than me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Aye?' returned the robber with an incredulous air.  'Tell away! Look\r\n",
      "sharp, or Nance will think I'm lost.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Lost!' cried Fagin.  'She has pretty well settled that, in her own\r\n",
      "mind, already.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew's face,\r\n",
      "and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched\r\n",
      "his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Speak, will you!' he said; 'or if you don't, it shall be for want of\r\n",
      "breath.  Open your mouth and say wot you've got to say in plain words.\r\n",
      "Out with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Suppose that lad that's laying there--' Fagin began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping, as if he had not\r\n",
      "previously observed him.  'Well!' he said, resuming his former position.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Suppose that lad,' pursued Fagin, 'was to peach--to blow upon us\r\n",
      "all--first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then having\r\n",
      "a meeting with 'em in the street to paint our likenesses, describe\r\n",
      "every mark that they might know us by, and the crib where we might be\r\n",
      "most easily taken.  Suppose he was to do all this, and besides to blow\r\n",
      "upon a plant we've all been in, more or less--of his own fancy; not\r\n",
      "grabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by the parson and brought to it on\r\n",
      "bread and water,--but of his own fancy; to please his own taste;\r\n",
      "stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us, and\r\n",
      "peaching to them.  Do you hear me?' cried the Jew, his eyes flashing\r\n",
      "with rage.  'Suppose he did all this, what then?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What then!' replied Sikes; with a tremendous oath.  'If he was left\r\n",
      "alive till I came, I'd grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot\r\n",
      "into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What if I did it!' cried Fagin almost in a yell.  'I, that knows so\r\n",
      "much, and could hang so many besides myself!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't know,' replied Sikes, clenching his teeth and turning white at\r\n",
      "the mere suggestion.  'I'd do something in the jail that 'ud get me put\r\n",
      "in irons; and if I was tried along with you, I'd fall upon you with\r\n",
      "them in the open court, and beat your brains out afore the people. I\r\n",
      "should have such strength,' muttered the robber, poising his brawny\r\n",
      "arm, 'that I could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over\r\n",
      "it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You would?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Would I!' said the housebreaker.  'Try me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If it was Charley, or the Dodger, or Bet, or--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't care who,' replied Sikes impatiently.  'Whoever it was, I'd\r\n",
      "serve them the same.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him to be silent,\r\n",
      "stooped over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse\r\n",
      "him.  Sikes leant forward in his chair:  looking on with his hands upon\r\n",
      "his knees, as if wondering much what all this questioning and\r\n",
      "preparation was to end in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bolter, Bolter!  Poor lad!' said Fagin, looking up with an expression\r\n",
      "of devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis.\r\n",
      "'He's tired--tired with watching for her so long,--watching for _her_,\r\n",
      "Bill.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Wot d'ye mean?' asked Sikes, drawing back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fagin made no answer, but bending over the sleeper again, hauled him\r\n",
      "into a sitting posture.  When his assumed name had been repeated\r\n",
      "several times, Noah rubbed his eyes, and, giving a heavy yawn, looked\r\n",
      "sleepily about him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Tell me that again--once again, just for him to hear,' said the Jew,\r\n",
      "pointing to Sikes as he spoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Tell yer what?' asked the sleepy Noah, shaking himself pettishly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That about-- _Nancy_,' said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the wrist, as if\r\n",
      "to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough. 'You\r\n",
      "followed her?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'To London Bridge?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Where she met two people.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'So she did.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'A gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before,\r\n",
      "who asked her to give up all her pals, and Monks first, which she\r\n",
      "did--and to describe him, which she did--and to tell her what house it\r\n",
      "was that we meet at, and go to, which she did--and where it could be\r\n",
      "best watched from, which she did--and what time the people went there,\r\n",
      "which she did.  She did all this.  She told it all every word without a\r\n",
      "threat, without a murmur--she did--did she not?' cried Fagin, half mad\r\n",
      "with fury.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'All right,' replied Noah, scratching his head.  'That's just what it\r\n",
      "was!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What did they say, about last Sunday?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'About last Sunday!' replied Noah, considering.  'Why I told yer that\r\n",
      "before.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Again.  Tell it again!' cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on Sikes,\r\n",
      "and brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'They asked her,' said Noah, who, as he grew more wakeful, seemed to\r\n",
      "have a dawning perception who Sikes was, 'they asked her why she didn't\r\n",
      "come, last Sunday, as she promised.  She said she couldn't.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why--why?  Tell him that.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Because she was forcibly kept at home by Bill, the man she had told\r\n",
      "them of before,' replied Noah.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What more of him?' cried Fagin.  'What more of the man she had told\r\n",
      "them of before?  Tell him that, tell him that.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why, that she couldn't very easily get out of doors unless he knew\r\n",
      "where she was going to,' said Noah; 'and so the first time she went to\r\n",
      "see the lady, she--ha! ha! ha! it made me laugh when she said it, that\r\n",
      "it did--she gave him a drink of laudanum.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hell's fire!' cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew.  'Let me\r\n",
      "go!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Flinging the old man from him, he rushed from the room, and darted,\r\n",

      "word.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was\r\n",
      "unable to open the door:  on which he was expending fruitless oaths and\r\n",
      "violence, when the Jew came panting up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Let me out,' said Sikes.  'Don't speak to me; it's not safe. Let me\r\n",
      "out, I say!'\r\n",

      "'Well,' replied the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You won't be--too--violent, Bill?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to see\r\n",
      "each other's faces.  They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire\r\n",
      "in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I mean,' said Fagin, showing that he felt all disguise was now\r\n",
      "useless, 'not too violent for safety.  Be crafty, Bill, and not too\r\n",
      "bold.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had\r\n",
      "turned the lock, dashed into the silent streets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Without one pause, or moment's consideration; without once turning his\r\n",
      "head to the right or left, or raising his eyes to the sky, or lowering\r\n",
      "them to the ground, but looking straight before him with savage\r\n",
      "resolution:  his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw\r\n",
      "seemed starting through his skin; the robber held on his headlong\r\n",
      "course, nor muttered a word, nor relaxed a muscle, until he reached his\r\n",
      "own door.  He opened it, softly, with a key; strode lightly up the\r\n",
      "stairs; and entering his own room, double-locked the door, and lifting\r\n",
      "a heavy table against it, drew back the curtain of the bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl was lying, half-dressed, upon it.  He had roused her from her\r\n",
      "sleep, for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Get up!' said the man.\r\n",

      "return.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It is,' was the reply.  'Get up.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the\r\n",
      "candlestick, and hurled it under the grate.  Seeing the faint light of\r\n",
      "early day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Let it be,' said Sikes, thrusting his hand before her. 'There's enough\r\n",
      "light for wot I've got to do.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bill,' said the girl, in the low voice of alarm, 'why do you look like\r\n",
      "that at me!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The robber sat regarding her, for a few seconds, with dilated nostrils\r\n",
      "and heaving breast; and then, grasping her by the head and throat,\r\n",
      "dragged her into the middle of the room, and looking once towards the\r\n",
      "door, placed his heavy hand upon her mouth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Bill, Bill!' gasped the girl, wrestling with the strength of mortal\r\n",
      "fear,--'I--I won't scream or cry--not once--hear me--speak to me--tell\r\n",
      "me what I have done!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You know, you she devil!' returned the robber, suppressing his breath.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'Then spare my life for the love of Heaven, as I spared yours,'\r\n",
      "rejoined the girl, clinging to him.  'Bill, dear Bill, you cannot have\r\n",
      "the heart to kill me.  Oh! think of all I have given up, only this one\r\n",
      "night, for you.  You _shall_ have time to think, and save yourself this\r\n",
      "crime; I will not loose my hold, you cannot throw me off.  Bill, Bill,\r\n",
      "for dear God's sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you spill my\r\n",
      "blood!  I have been true to you, upon my guilty soul I have!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man struggled violently, to release his arms; but those of the girl\r\n",

      "life, and hope, and freshness to man--burst upon the crowded city in\r\n",
      "clear and radiant glory.  Through costly-coloured glass and\r\n",

      "its equal ray.  It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay.\r\n",

      "glaring upward, as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it. There\r\n",
      "was hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder,\r\n",
      "and, caught by the air, whirled up the chimney.  Even that frightened\r\n",
      "him, sturdy as he was; but he held the weapon till it broke, and then\r\n",
      "piled it on the coals to burn away, and smoulder into ashes.  He washed\r\n",
      "himself, and rubbed his clothes; there were spots that would not be\r\n",
      "removed, but he cut the pieces out, and burnt them.  How those stains\r\n",
      "were dispersed about the room!  The very feet of the dog were bloody.\r\n",

      "the very spot!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The glance was instantaneous.  It was a relief to have got free of the\r\n",
      "room.  He whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on which\r\n",
      "stands the stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to Highgate\r\n",
      "Hill, unsteady of purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the\r\n",
      "right again, almost as soon as he began to descend it; and taking the\r\n",
      "foot-path across the fields, skirted Caen Wood, and so came on\r\n",
      "Hampstead Heath.  Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath, he\r\n",
      "mounted the opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins the\r\n",
      "villages of Hampstead and Highgate, made along the remaining portion of\r\n",
      "the heath to the fields at North End, in one of which he laid himself\r\n",
      "down under a hedge, and slept.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon he was up again, and away,--not far into the country, but back\r\n",
      "towards London by the high-road--then back again--then over another\r\n",
      "part of the same ground as he already traversed--then wandering up and\r\n",
      "down in fields, and lying on ditches' brinks to rest, and starting up\r\n",
      "to make for some other spot, and do the same, and ramble on again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Where could he go, that was near and not too public, to get some meat\r\n",
      "and drink?  Hendon.  That was a good place, not far off, and out of\r\n",
      "most people's way.  Thither he directed his steps,--running sometimes,\r\n",
      "and sometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail's pace,\r\n",
      "or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick.  But\r\n",
      "when he got there, all the people he met--the very children at the\r\n",
      "doors--seemed to view him with suspicion.  Back he turned again,\r\n",
      "without the courage to purchase bit or drop, though he had tasted no\r\n",
      "food for many hours; and once more he lingered on the Heath, uncertain\r\n",
      "where to go.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the\r\n",
      "old place.  Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane,\r\n",
      "and still he rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round,\r\n",
      "and still lingered about the same spot.  At last he got away, and\r\n",
      "shaped his course for Hatfield.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was nine o'clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and the\r\n",
      "dog, limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned down the\r\n",
      "hill by the church of the quiet village, and plodding along the little\r\n",
      "street, crept into a small public-house, whose scanty light had guided\r\n",
      "them to the spot.  There was a fire in the tap-room, and some\r\n",
      "country-labourers were drinking before it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They made room for the stranger, but he sat down in the furthest\r\n",
      "corner, and ate and drank alone, or rather with his dog:  to whom he\r\n",
      "cast a morsel of food from time to time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the\r\n",
      "neighbouring land, and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted,\r\n",
      "upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous\r\n",
      "Sunday; the young men present considering him very old, and the old men\r\n",
      "present declaring him to have been quite young--not older, one\r\n",
      "white-haired grandfather said, than he was--with ten or fifteen year of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this. The\r\n",
      "robber, after paying his reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed in his\r\n",
      "corner, and had almost dropped asleep, when he was half wakened by the\r\n",
      "noisy entrance of a new comer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who\r\n",
      "travelled about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors,\r\n",
      "washballs, harness-paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap\r\n",
      "perfumery, cosmetics, and such-like wares, which he carried in a case\r\n",
      "slung to his back.  His entrance was the signal for various homely\r\n",
      "jokes with the countrymen, which slackened not until he had made his\r\n",
      "supper, and opened his box of treasures, when he ingeniously contrived\r\n",
      "to unite business with amusement.\r\n",

      "to go.  At length he went back again, and took the road which leads\r\n",
      "from Hatfield to St. Albans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went on doggedly; but as he left the town behind him, and plunged\r\n",
      "into the solitude and darkness of the road, he felt a dread and awe\r\n",
      "creeping upon him which shook him to the core. Every object before him,\r\n",
      "substance or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some\r\n",
      "fearful thing; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that\r\n",
      "haunted him of that morning's ghastly figure following at his heels.\r\n",
      "He could trace its shadow in the gloom, supply the smallest item of the\r\n",
      "outline, and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along.  He\r\n",
      "could hear its garments rustling in the leaves, and every breath of\r\n",
      "wind came laden with that last low cry.  If he stopped it did the same.\r\n",
      "If he ran, it followed--not running too:  that would have been a\r\n",
      "relief:  but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and\r\n",
      "borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell.\r\n",

      "At times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat\r\n",
      "this phantom off, though it should look him dead; but the hair rose on\r\n",
      "his head, and his blood stood still, for it had turned with him and was\r\n",
      "behind him then.  He had kept it before him that morning, but it was\r\n",
      "behind now--always.  He leaned his back against a bank, and felt that\r\n",
      "it stood above him, visibly out against the cold night-sky.  He threw\r\n",
      "himself upon the road--on his back upon the road.  At his head it\r\n",
      "stood, silent, erect, and still--a living grave-stone, with its epitaph\r\n",
      "in blood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that Providence\r\n",
      "must sleep.  There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long\r\n",
      "minute of that agony of fear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for the\r\n",
      "night.  Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it\r\n",
      "very dark within; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail.\r\n",
      "He _could not_ walk on, till daylight came again; and here he stretched\r\n",
      "himself close to the wall--to undergo new torture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible than\r\n",
      "that from which he had escaped.  Those widely staring eyes, so\r\n",
      "lustreless and so glassy, that he had better borne to see them than\r\n",
      "think upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness: light in\r\n",
      "themselves, but giving light to nothing.  There were but two, but they\r\n",
      "were everywhere.  If he shut out the sight, there came the room with\r\n",
      "every well-known object--some, indeed, that he would have forgotten, if\r\n",
      "he had gone over its contents from memory--each in its accustomed\r\n",
      "place.  The body was in _its_ place, and its eyes were as he saw them\r\n",
      "when he stole away.  He got up, and rushed into the field without.  The\r\n",
      "figure was behind him. He re-entered the shed, and shrunk down once\r\n",
      "more.  The eyes were there, before he had laid himself along.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And here he remained in such terror as none but he can know, trembling\r\n",
      "in every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when\r\n",
      "suddenly there arose upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting,\r\n",
      "and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder.  Any sound of men\r\n",
      "in that lonely place, even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm,\r\n",
      "was something to him.  He regained his strength and energy at the\r\n",
      "prospect of personal danger; and springing to his feet, rushed into the\r\n",
      "open air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The broad sky seemed on fire.  Rising into the air with showers of\r\n",
      "sparks, and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting\r\n",
      "the atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the\r\n",
      "direction where he stood.  The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled\r\n",
      "the roar, and he could hear the cry of Fire! mingled with the ringing\r\n",
      "of an alarm-bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and the crackling of flames\r\n",
      "as they twined round some new obstacle, and shot aloft as though\r\n",
      "refreshed by food.  The noise increased as he looked.  There were\r\n",
      "people there--men and women--light, bustle.  It was like new life to\r\n",
      "him.  He darted onward--straight, headlong--dashing through brier and\r\n",
      "brake, and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog, who careered\r\n",
      "with loud and sounding bark before him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He came upon the spot.  There were half-dressed figures tearing to and\r\n",
      "fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables,\r\n",
      "others driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others\r\n",
      "coming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks,\r\n",
      "and the tumbling down of red-hot beams.  The apertures, where doors and\r\n",
      "windows stood an hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls\r\n",
      "rocked and crumbled into the burning well; the molten lead and iron\r\n",
      "poured down, white hot, upon the ground.  Women and children shrieked,\r\n",
      "and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers.  The\r\n",
      "clanking of the engine-pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water\r\n",
      "as it fell upon the blazing wood, added to the tremendous roar.  He\r\n",
      "shouted, too, till he was hoarse; and flying from memory and himself,\r\n",
      "plunged into the thickest of the throng.  Hither and thither he dived\r\n",
      "that night:  now working at the pumps, and now hurrying through the\r\n",
      "smoke and flame, but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and\r\n",
      "men were thickest.  Up and down the ladders, upon the roofs of\r\n",
      "buildings, over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight, under\r\n",
      "the lee of falling bricks and stones, in every part of that great fire\r\n",
      "was he; but he bore a charmed life, and had neither scratch nor bruise,\r\n",
      "nor weariness nor thought, till morning dawned again, and only smoke\r\n",
      "and blackened ruins remained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This mad excitement over, there returned, with ten-fold force, the\r\n",
      "dreadful consciousness of his crime.  He looked suspiciously about him,\r\n",
      "for the men were conversing in groups, and he feared to be the subject\r\n",
      "of their talk.  The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger, and\r\n",
      "they drew off, stealthily, together.  He passed near an engine where\r\n",
      "some men were seated, and they called to him to share in their\r\n",
      "refreshment.  He took some bread and meat; and as he drank a draught of\r\n",
      "beer, heard the firemen, who were from London, talking about the\r\n",
      "murder.  'He has gone to Birmingham, they say,' said one:  'but they'll\r\n",
      "have him yet, for the scouts are out, and by to-morrow night there'll\r\n",
      "be a cry all through the country.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He hurried off, and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground; then\r\n",
      "lay down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and uneasy sleep.  He\r\n",
      "wandered on again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the\r\n",
      "fear of another solitary night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to London.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There's somebody to speak to there, at all event,' he thought. 'A good\r\n",
      "hiding-place, too.  They'll never expect to nab me there, after this\r\n",
      "country scent.  Why can't I lie by for a week or so, and, forcing blunt\r\n",
      "from Fagin, get abroad to France?  Damme, I'll risk it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least\r\n",
      "frequented roads began his journey back, resolved to lie concealed\r\n",
      "within a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by\r\n",
      "a circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he had\r\n",
      "fixed on for his destination.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dog, though.  If any description of him were out, it would not be\r\n",
      "forgotten that the dog was missing, and had probably gone with him.\r\n",
      "This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets.  He\r\n",
      "resolved to drown him, and walked on, looking about for a pond:\r\n",
      "picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animal looked up into his master's face while these preparations\r\n",
      "were making; whether his instinct apprehended something of their\r\n",
      "purpose, or the robber's sidelong look at him was sterner than\r\n",
      "ordinary, he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual, and\r\n",
      "cowered as he came more slowly along.  When his master halted at the\r\n",
      "brink of a pool, and looked round to call him, he stopped outright.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do you hear me call?  Come here!' cried Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped\r\n",
      "to attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and\r\n",
      "started back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come back!' said the robber.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dog wagged his tail, but moved not.  Sikes made a running noose and\r\n",
      "called him again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his\r\n",
      "hardest speed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the\r\n",
      "expectation that he would return.  But no dog appeared, and at length\r\n",
      "he resumed his journey.\r\n",

      "MONKS AND MR. BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET.  THEIR CONVERSATION, AND THE\r\n",
      "INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IT\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      " The twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr. Brownlow\r\n",
      "alighted from a hackney-coach at his own door, and knocked softly.  The\r\n",
      "door being opened, a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed\r\n",
      "himself on one side of the steps, while another man, who had been\r\n",
      "seated on the box, dismounted too, and stood upon the other side.  At a\r\n",
      "sign from Mr. Brownlow, they helped out a third man, and taking him\r\n",
      "between them, hurried him into the house. This man was Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and Mr.\r\n",
      "Brownlow, preceding them, led the way into a back-room. At the door of\r\n",
      "this apartment, Monks, who had ascended with evident reluctance,\r\n",
      "stopped.  The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for\r\n",
      "instructions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He knows the alternative,' said Mr. Browlow.  'If he hesitates or\r\n",
      "moves a finger but as you bid him, drag him into the street, call for\r\n",
      "the aid of the police, and impeach him as a felon in my name.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'How dare you say this of me?' asked Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'How dare you urge me to it, young man?' replied Mr. Brownlow,\r\n",
      "confronting him with a steady look.  'Are you mad enough to leave this\r\n",
      "house?  Unhand him.  There, sir. You are free to go, and we to follow.\r\n",
      "But I warn you, by all I hold most solemn and most sacred, that instant\r\n",
      "will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery.  I am\r\n",
      "resolute and immoveable.  If you are determined to be the same, your\r\n",
      "blood be upon your own head!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'By what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here by\r\n",
      "these dogs?' asked Monks, looking from one to the other of the men who\r\n",
      "stood beside him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'By mine,' replied Mr. Brownlow.  'Those persons are indemnified by me.\r\n",
      "If you complain of being deprived of your liberty--you had power and\r\n",
      "opportunity to retrieve it as you came along, but you deemed it\r\n",
      "advisable to remain quiet--I say again, throw yourself for protection\r\n",
      "on the law.  I will appeal to the law too; but when you have gone too\r\n",
      "far to recede, do not sue to me for leniency, when the power will have\r\n",
      "passed into other hands; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf\r\n",
      "into which you rushed, yourself.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Monks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides.  He hesitated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You will decide quickly,' said Mr. Brownlow, with perfect firmness and\r\n",
      "composure.  'If you wish me to prefer my charges publicly, and consign\r\n",
      "you to a punishment the extent of which, although I can, with a\r\n",
      "shudder, foresee, I cannot control, once more, I say, for you know the\r\n",
      "way.  If not, and you appeal to my forbearance, and the mercy of those\r\n",
      "you have deeply injured, seat yourself, without a word, in that chair.\r\n",
      "It has waited for you two whole days.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Monks muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You will be prompt,' said Mr. Brownlow.  'A word from me, and the\r\n",
      "alternative has gone for ever.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still the man hesitated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I have not the inclination to parley,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'and, as I\r\n",
      "advocate the dearest interests of others, I have not the right.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is there--' demanded Monks with a faltering tongue,--'is there--no\r\n",
      "middle course?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'None.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Monks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but, reading in\r\n",
      "his countenance nothing but severity and determination, walked into the\r\n",
      "room, and, shrugging his shoulders, sat down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Lock the door on the outside,' said Mr. Brownlow to the attendants,\r\n",
      "'and come when I ring.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The men obeyed, and the two were left alone together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This is pretty treatment, sir,' said Monks, throwing down his hat and\r\n",
      "cloak, 'from my father's oldest friend.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It is because I was your father's oldest friend, young man,' returned\r\n",
      "Mr. Brownlow; 'it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy\r\n",
      "years were bound up with him, and that fair creature of his blood and\r\n",
      "kindred who rejoined her God in youth, and left me here a solitary,\r\n",
      "lonely man:  it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters's\r\n",
      "death-bed when he was yet a boy, on the morning that would--but Heaven\r\n",
      "willed otherwise--have made her my young wife; it is because my seared\r\n",
      "heart clung to him, from that time forth, through all his trials and\r\n",
      "errors, till he died; it is because old recollections and associations\r\n",
      "filled my heart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts\r\n",
      "of him; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you\r\n",
      "gently now--yes, Edward Leeford, even now--and blush for your\r\n",
      "unworthiness who bear the name.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What has the name to do with it?' asked the other, after\r\n",
      "contemplating, half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the\r\n",
      "agitation of his companion.  'What is the name to me?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing,' replied Mr. Brownlow, 'nothing to you.  But it was _hers_,\r\n",
      "and even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old man, the\r\n",
      "glow and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a\r\n",
      "stranger.  I am very glad you have changed it--very--very.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This is all mighty fine,' said Monks (to retain his assumed\r\n",
      "designation) after a long silence, during which he had jerked himself\r\n",
      "in sullen defiance to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat, shading his\r\n",
      "face with his hand. 'But what do you want with me?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You have a brother,' said Mr. Brownlow, rousing himself:  'a brother,\r\n",
      "the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the\r\n",
      "street, was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither,\r\n",
      "in wonder and alarm.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I have no brother,' replied Monks.  'You know I was an only child.\r\n",
      "Why do you talk to me of brothers?  You know that, as well as I.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Attend to what I do know, and you may not,' said Mr. Brownlow. 'I\r\n",
      "shall interest you by and by.  I know that of the wretched marriage,\r\n",
      "into which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all\r\n",
      "ambition, forced your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole\r\n",
      "and most unnatural issue.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I don't care for hard names,' interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh.\r\n",
      "'You know the fact, and that's enough for me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'But I also know,' pursued the old gentleman, 'the misery, the slow\r\n",
      "torture, the protracted anguish of that ill-assorted union. I know how\r\n",
      "listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their\r\n",
      "heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both.  I know how\r\n",
      "cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts; how indifference gave\r\n",
      "place to dislike, dislike to hate, and hate to loathing, until at last\r\n",
      "they wrenched the clanking bond asunder, and retiring a wide space\r\n",
      "apart, carried each a galling fragment, of which nothing but death\r\n",
      "could break the rivets, to hide it in new society beneath the gayest\r\n",
      "looks they could assume.  Your mother succeeded; she forgot it soon.\r\n",
      "But it rusted and cankered at your father's heart for years.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Well, they were separated,' said Monks, 'and what of that?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'When they had been separated for some time,' returned Mr. Brownlow,\r\n",
      "'and your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had\r\n",
      "utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior, who,\r\n",
      "with prospects blighted, lingered on at home, he fell among new\r\n",
      "friends.  This circumstance, at least, you know already.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Not I,' said Monks, turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon\r\n",
      "the ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything. 'Not I.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Your manner, no less than your actions, assures me that you have never\r\n",
      "forgotten it, or ceased to think of it with bitterness,' returned Mr.\r\n",
      "Brownlow.  'I speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than\r\n",
      "eleven years old, and your father but one-and-thirty--for he was, I\r\n",
      "repeat, a boy, when _his_ father ordered him to marry. Must I go back\r\n",
      "to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent, or will\r\n",
      "you spare it, and disclose to me the truth?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I have nothing to disclose,' rejoined Monks.  'You must talk on if you\r\n",
      "will.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'These new friends, then,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'were a naval officer\r\n",
      "retired from active service, whose wife had died some half-a-year\r\n",
      "before, and left him with two children--there had been more, but, of\r\n",
      "all their family, happily but two survived. They were both daughters;\r\n",
      "one a beautiful creature of nineteen, and the other a mere child of two\r\n",
      "or three years old.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What's this to me?' asked Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'They resided,' said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the\r\n",
      "interruption, 'in a part of the country to which your father in his\r\n",
      "wandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode.\r\n",
      "Acquaintance, intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other. Your\r\n",
      "father was gifted as few men are.  He had his sister's soul and person.\r\n",
      "As the old officer knew him more and more, he grew to love him.  I\r\n",
      "would that it had ended there.  His daughter did the same.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old gentleman paused; Monks was biting his lips, with his eyes\r\n",
      "fixed upon the floor; seeing this, he immediately resumed:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The end of a year found him contracted, solemnly contracted, to that\r\n",
      "daughter; the object of the first, true, ardent, only passion of a\r\n",
      "guileless girl.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Your tale is of the longest,' observed Monks, moving restlessly in his\r\n",
      "chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,' returned\r\n",
      "Mr. Brownlow, 'and such tales usually are; if it were one of unmixed\r\n",
      "joy and happiness, it would be very brief.  At length one of those rich\r\n",
      "relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had\r\n",
      "been sacrificed, as others are often--it is no uncommon case--died, and\r\n",
      "to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning, left him\r\n",
      "his panacea for all griefs--Money.  It was necessary that he should\r\n",
      "immediately repair to Rome, whither this man had sped for health, and\r\n",
      "where he had died, leaving his affairs in great confusion.  He went;\r\n",
      "was seized with mortal illness there; was followed, the moment the\r\n",
      "intelligence reached Paris, by your mother who carried you with her; he\r\n",
      "died the day after her arrival, leaving no will--_no will_--so that the\r\n",
      "whole property fell to her and you.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this part of the recital Monks held his breath, and listened with a\r\n",
      "face of intense eagerness, though his eyes were not directed towards\r\n",
      "the speaker.  As Mr. Brownlow paused, he changed his position with the\r\n",
      "air of one who has experienced a sudden relief, and wiped his hot face\r\n",
      "and hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Before he went abroad, and as he passed through London on his way,'\r\n",
      "said Mr. Brownlow, slowly, and fixing his eyes upon the other's face,\r\n",
      "'he came to me.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I never heard of that,' interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear\r\n",
      "incredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a picture--a\r\n",
      "portrait painted by himself--a likeness of this poor girl--which he did\r\n",
      "not wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward on his hasty\r\n",
      "journey.  He was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow; talked\r\n",
      "in a wild, distracted way, of ruin and dishonour worked by himself;\r\n",
      "confided to me his intention to convert his whole property, at any\r\n",
      "loss, into money, and, having settled on his wife and you a portion of\r\n",
      "his recent acquisition, to fly the country--I guessed too well he would\r\n",
      "not fly alone--and never see it more.  Even from me, his old and early\r\n",
      "friend, whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that\r\n",
      "covered one most dear to both--even from me he withheld any more\r\n",
      "particular confession, promising to write and tell me all, and after\r\n",
      "that to see me once again, for the last time on earth. Alas!  _That_\r\n",
      "was the last time.  I had no letter, and I never saw him more.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I went,' said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, 'I went, when all was\r\n",
      "over, to the scene of his--I will use the term the world would freely\r\n",
      "use, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him--of his\r\n",
      "guilty love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child\r\n",
      "should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her.  The\r\n",
      "family had left that part a week before; they had called in such\r\n",
      "trifling debts as were outstanding, discharged them, and left the place\r\n",
      "by night.  Why, or whither, none can tell.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Monks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of\r\n",
      "triumph.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'When your brother,' said Mr. Brownlow, drawing nearer to the other's\r\n",
      "chair, 'When your brother:  a feeble, ragged, neglected child:  was\r\n",
      "cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance, and rescued by me from a\r\n",
      "life of vice and infamy--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What?' cried Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'By me,' said Mr. Brownlow.  'I told you I should interest you before\r\n",
      "long.  I say by me--I see that your cunning associate suppressed my\r\n",
      "name, although for ought he knew, it would be quite strange to your\r\n",
      "ears.  When he was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from\r\n",
      "sickness in my house, his strong resemblance to this picture I have\r\n",
      "spoken of, struck me with astonishment.  Even when I first saw him in\r\n",
      "all his dirt and misery, there was a lingering expression in his face\r\n",
      "that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in\r\n",
      "a vivid dream.  I need not tell you he was snared away before I knew\r\n",
      "his history--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why not?' asked Monks hastily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Because you know it well.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Denial to me is vain,' replied Mr. Brownlow.  'I shall show you that I\r\n",
      "know more than that.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You--you--can't prove anything against me,' stammered Monks.  'I defy\r\n",
      "you to do it!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We shall see,' returned the old gentleman with a searching glance.  'I\r\n",
      "lost the boy, and no efforts of mine could recover him.  Your mother\r\n",
      "being dead, I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody\r\n",
      "could, and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate\r\n",
      "in the West Indies--whither, as you well know, you retired upon your\r\n",
      "mother's death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here--I\r\n",
      "made the voyage.  You had left it, months before, and were supposed to\r\n",
      "be in London, but no one could tell where.  I returned.  Your agents\r\n",
      "had no clue to your residence.  You came and went, they said, as\r\n",
      "strangely as you had ever done:  sometimes for days together and\r\n",
      "sometimes not for months:  keeping to all appearance the same low\r\n",
      "haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your\r\n",
      "associates when a fierce ungovernable boy.  I wearied them with new\r\n",
      "applications.  I paced the streets by night and day, but until two\r\n",
      "hours ago, all my efforts were fruitless, and I never saw you for an\r\n",
      "instant.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And now you do see me,' said Monks, rising boldly, 'what then? Fraud\r\n",
      "and robbery are high-sounding words--justified, you think, by a fancied\r\n",
      "resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man's Brother!\r\n",
      "You don't even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair; you\r\n",
      "don't even know that.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I _did not_,' replied Mr. Brownlow, rising too; 'but within the last\r\n",
      "fortnight I have learnt it all.  You have a brother; you know it, and\r\n",
      "him.  There was a will, which your mother destroyed, leaving the secret\r\n",
      "and the gain to you at her own death.  It contained a reference to some\r\n",
      "child likely to be the result of this sad connection, which child was\r\n",
      "born, and accidentally encountered by you, when your suspicions were\r\n",
      "first awakened by his resemblance to your father.  You repaired to the\r\n",
      "place of his birth. There existed proofs--proofs long suppressed--of\r\n",
      "his birth and parentage.  Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now,\r\n",
      "in your own words to your accomplice the Jew, \"_the only proofs of the\r\n",
      "boy's identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that\r\n",
      "received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin_.\" Unworthy son,\r\n",
      "coward, liar,--you, who hold your councils with thieves and murderers\r\n",
      "in dark rooms at night,--you, whose plots and wiles have brought a\r\n",
      "violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you,--you,\r\n",
      "who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father's\r\n",
      "heart, and in whom all evil passions, vice, and profligacy, festered,\r\n",
      "till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an\r\n",
      "index even to your mind--you, Edward Leeford, do you still brave me!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no, no!' returned the coward, overwhelmed by these accumulated\r\n",
      "charges.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Every word!' cried the gentleman, 'every word that has passed between\r\n",
      "you and this detested villain, is known to me.  Shadows on the wall\r\n",
      "have caught your whispers, and brought them to my ear; the sight of the\r\n",
      "persecuted child has turned vice itself, and given it the courage and\r\n",
      "almost the attributes of virtue. Murder has been done, to which you\r\n",
      "were morally if not really a party.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no,' interposed Monks.  'I--I knew nothing of that; I was going to\r\n",
      "inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me.  I didn't know the\r\n",
      "cause.  I thought it was a common quarrel.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It was the partial disclosure of your secrets,' replied Mr. Brownlow.\r\n",
      "'Will you disclose the whole?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, I will.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Set your hand to a statement of truth and facts, and repeat it before\r\n",
      "witnesses?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That I promise too.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Remain quietly here, until such a document is drawn up, and proceed\r\n",
      "with me to such a place as I may deem most advisable, for the purpose\r\n",
      "of attesting it?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If you insist upon that, I'll do that also,' replied Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You must do more than that,' said Mr. Brownlow.  'Make restitution to\r\n",
      "an innocent and unoffending child, for such he is, although the\r\n",
      "offspring of a guilty and most miserable love.  You have not forgotten\r\n",
      "the provisions of the will.  Carry them into execution so far as your\r\n",
      "brother is concerned, and then go where you please.  In this world you\r\n",
      "need meet no more.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While Monks was pacing up and down, meditating with dark and evil looks\r\n",
      "on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it:  torn by his\r\n",
      "fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other:  the door was\r\n",
      "hurriedly unlocked, and a gentleman (Mr. Losberne) entered the room in\r\n",
      "violent agitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The man will be taken,' he cried.  'He will be taken to-night!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The murderer?' asked Mr. Brownlow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, yes,' replied the other.  'His dog has been seen lurking about\r\n",
      "some old haunt, and there seems little doubt that his master either is,\r\n",
      "or will be, there, under cover of the darkness.  Spies are hovering\r\n",
      "about in every direction.  I have spoken to the men who are charged\r\n",
      "with his capture, and they tell me he cannot escape.  A reward of a\r\n",
      "hundred pounds is proclaimed by Government to-night.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I will give fifty more,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'and proclaim it with my\r\n",
      "own lips upon the spot, if I can reach it.  Where is Mr. Maylie?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Harry?  As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with\r\n",
      "you, he hurried off to where he heard this,' replied the doctor, 'and\r\n",
      "mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place\r\n",
      "in the outskirts agreed upon between them.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Fagin,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'what of him?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'When I last heard, he had not been taken, but he will be, or is, by\r\n",
      "this time.  They're sure of him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Have you made up your mind?' asked Mr. Brownlow, in a low voice, of\r\n",
      "Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,' he replied.  'You--you--will be secret with me?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I will.  Remain here till I return.  It is your only hope of safety.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They left the room, and the door was again locked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What have you done?' asked the doctor in a whisper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'All that I could hope to do, and even more.  Coupling the poor girl's\r\n",
      "intelligence with my previous knowledge, and the result of our good\r\n",
      "friend's inquiries on the spot, I left him no loophole of escape, and\r\n",
      "laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day.\r\n",
      "Write and appoint the evening after to-morrow, at seven, for the\r\n",
      "meeting.  We shall be down there, a few hours before, but shall require\r\n",
      "rest:  especially the young lady, who _may_ have greater need of\r\n",
      "firmness than either you or I can quite foresee just now.  But my blood\r\n",
      "boils to avenge this poor murdered creature.  Which way have they\r\n",
      "taken?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Near to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe\r\n",
      "abuts, where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on\r\n",
      "the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of\r\n",
      "close-built low-roofed houses, there exists the filthiest, the\r\n",
      "strangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities that are\r\n",
      "hidden in London, wholly unknown, even by name, to the great mass of\r\n",
      "its inhabitants.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To reach this place, the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of\r\n",
      "close, narrow, and muddy streets, thronged by the roughest and poorest\r\n",
      "of waterside people, and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to\r\n",
      "occasion.  The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the\r\n",
      "shops; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at\r\n",
      "the salesman's door, and stream from the house-parapet and windows.\r\n",
      "Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class,\r\n",
      "ballast-heavers, coal-whippers, brazen women, ragged children, and the\r\n",
      "raff and refuse of the river, he makes his way with difficulty along,\r\n",
      "assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which\r\n",
      "branch off on the right and left, and deafened by the clash of\r\n",
      "ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks\r\n",
      "of warehouses that rise from every corner.  Arriving, at length, in\r\n",
      "streets remoter and less-frequented than those through which he has\r\n",
      "passed, he walks beneath tottering house-fronts projecting over the\r\n",
      "pavement, dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes, chimneys\r\n",
      "half crushed half hesitating to fall, windows guarded by rusty iron\r\n",
      "bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away, every imaginable sign\r\n",
      "of desolation and neglect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In such a neighborhood, beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark,\r\n",
      "stands Jacob's Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch, six or eight feet\r\n",
      "deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in, once called Mill\r\n",
      "Pond, but known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch.  It is a\r\n",
      "creek or inlet from the Thames, and can always be filled at high water\r\n",
      "by opening the sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old\r\n",
      "name.  At such times, a stranger, looking from one of the wooden\r\n",
      "bridges thrown across it at Mill Lane, will see the inhabitants of the\r\n",
      "houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows,\r\n",
      "buckets, pails, domestic utensils of all kinds, in which to haul the\r\n",
      "water up; and when his eye is turned from these operations to the\r\n",
      "houses themselves, his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene\r\n",
      "before him.  Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen\r\n",
      "houses, with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows,\r\n",
      "broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on which to dry the linen\r\n",
      "that is never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the\r\n",
      "air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they\r\n",
      "shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud, and\r\n",
      "threatening to fall into it--as some have done; dirt-besmeared walls\r\n",
      "and decaying foundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty, every\r\n",
      "loathsome indication of filth, rot, and garbage; all these ornament the\r\n",

      "Thirty or forty years ago, before losses and chancery suits came upon\r\n",
      "it, it was a thriving place; but now it is a desolate island indeed.\r\n",
      "The houses have no owners; they are broken open, and entered upon by\r\n",
      "those who have the courage; and there they live, and there they die.\r\n",
      "They must have powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced\r\n",
      "to a destitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in Jacob's Island.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In an upper room of one of these houses--a detached house of fair size,\r\n",
      "ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window:\r\n",
      "of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already\r\n",
      "described--there were assembled three men, who, regarding each other\r\n",
      "every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation,\r\n",
      "sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence.  One of these was\r\n",
      "Toby Crackit, another Mr. Chitling, and the third a robber of fifty\r\n",
      "years, whose nose had been almost beaten in, in some old scuffle, and\r\n",
      "whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the\r\n",
      "same occasion.  This man was a returned transport, and his name was\r\n",
      "Kags.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "'Why, look'e, young gentleman,' said Toby, 'when a man keeps himself so\r\n",
      "very ex-clusive as I have done, and by that means has a snug house over\r\n",
      "his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it, it's rather a\r\n",
      "startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman\r\n",

      "added Mr. Kags.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, seeming to abandon\r\n",

      "people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken--I\r\n",
      "went up there and see it with my own eyes--is filled with traps.'\r\n",

      "fought like devils, or they'd have torn him away.  He was down once,\r\n",
      "but they made a ring round him, and fought their way along.  You should\r\n",
      "have seen how he looked about him, all muddy and bleeding, and clung to\r\n",
      "them as if they were his dearest friends.  I can see 'em now, not able\r\n",
      "to stand upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him along\r\n",
      "amongst 'em; I can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and\r\n",
      "snarling with their teeth and making at him; I can see the blood upon\r\n",
      "his hair and beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked\r\n",
      "themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and swore\r\n",
      "they'd tear his heart out!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his\r\n",
      "ears, and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro,\r\n",
      "like one distracted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their\r\n",
      "eyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs,\r\n",
      "and Sikes's dog bounded into the room.  They ran to the window,\r\n",
      "downstairs, and into the street.  The dog had jumped in at an open\r\n",
      "window; he made no attempt to follow them, nor was his master to be\r\n",
      "seen.\r\n",

      "'Here!  Give us some water for him; he has run himself faint.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He's drunk it all up, every drop,' said Chitling after watching the\r\n",
      "dog some time in silence.  'Covered with mud--lame--half blind--he must\r\n",
      "have come a long way.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Where can he have come from!' exclaimed Toby.  'He's been to the other\r\n",
      "kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here,\r\n",
      "where he's been many a time and often.  But where can he have come from\r\n",
      "first, and how comes he here alone without the other!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He'--(none of them called the murderer by his old name)--'He can't\r\n",
      "have made away with himself.  What do you think?' said Chitling.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'If he had,' said Kags, 'the dog 'ud want to lead us away to where he\r\n",
      "did it.  No.  I think he's got out of the country, and left the dog\r\n",
      "behind.  He must have given him the slip somehow, or he wouldn't be so\r\n",
      "easy.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as the\r\n",
      "right; the dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to sleep,\r\n",
      "without more notice from anybody.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted and\r\n",
      "placed upon the table.  The terrible events of the last two days had\r\n",
      "made a deep impression on all three, increased by the danger and\r\n",
      "uncertainty of their own position.  They drew their chairs closer\r\n",
      "together, starting at every sound.  They spoke little, and that in\r\n",
      "whispers, and were as silent and awe-stricken as if the remains of the\r\n",
      "murdered woman lay in the next room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried\r\n",
      "knocking at the door below.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Young Bates,' said Kags, looking angrily round, to check the fear he\r\n",
      "felt himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The knocking came again.  No, it wasn't he.  He never knocked like that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Crackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his head.\r\n",
      "There was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough.\r\n",
      "The dog too was on the alert in an instant, and ran whining to the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We must let him in,' he said, taking up the candle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Isn't there any help for it?' asked the other man in a hoarse voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'None.  He _must_ come in.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Don't leave us in the dark,' said Kags, taking down a candle from the\r\n",
      "chimney-piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling hand that the\r\n",
      "knocking was twice repeated before he had finished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Crackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the\r\n",
      "lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief, and another tied over\r\n",
      "his head under his hat.  He drew them slowly off.  Blanched face,\r\n",
      "sunken eyes, hollow cheeks, beard of three days' growth, wasted flesh,\r\n",
      "short thick breath; it was the very ghost of Sikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room,\r\n",
      "but shuddering as he was about to drop into it, and seeming to glance\r\n",
      "over his shoulder, dragged it back close to the wall--as close as it\r\n",
      "would go--and ground it against it--and sat down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not a word had been exchanged.  He looked from one to another in\r\n",
      "silence.  If an eye were furtively raised and met his, it was instantly\r\n",
      "averted.  When his hollow voice broke silence, they all three started.\r\n",
      "They seemed never to have heard its tones before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'How came that dog here?' he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Alone.  Three hours ago.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'To-night's paper says that Fagin's took.  Is it true, or a lie?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'True.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were silent again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Damn you all!' said Sikes, passing his hand across his forehead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Have you nothing to say to me?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You that keep this house,' said Sikes, turning his face to Crackit,\r\n",
      "'do you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is over?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You may stop here, if you think it safe,' returned the person\r\n",
      "addressed, after some hesitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him:  rather trying to\r\n",
      "turn his head than actually doing it:  and said, 'Is--it--the body--is\r\n",
      "it buried?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They shook their heads.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Why isn't it!' he retorted with the same glance behind him. 'Wot do\r\n",
      "they keep such ugly things above the ground for?--Who's that knocking?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Crackit intimated, by a motion of his hand as he left the room, that\r\n",
      "there was nothing to fear; and directly came back with Charley Bates\r\n",
      "behind him.  Sikes sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy\r\n",
      "entered the room he encountered his figure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Toby,' said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his eyes towards\r\n",
      "him, 'why didn't you tell me this, downstairs?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the\r\n",
      "three, that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad.\r\n",
      "Accordingly he nodded, and made as though he would shake hands with him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Let me go into some other room,' said the boy, retreating still\r\n",
      "farther.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Charley!' said Sikes, stepping forward.  'Don't you--don't you know\r\n",
      "me?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Don't come nearer me,' answered the boy, still retreating, and\r\n",
      "looking, with horror in his eyes, upon the murderer's face.  'You\r\n",
      "monster!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but Sikes's\r\n",
      "eyes sunk gradually to the ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Witness you three,' cried the boy shaking his clenched fist, and\r\n",
      "becoming more and more excited as he spoke. 'Witness you three--I'm not\r\n",
      "afraid of him--if they come here after him, I'll give him up; I will.\r\n",
      "I tell you out at once.  He may kill me for it if he likes, or if he\r\n",
      "dares, but if I am here I'll give him up.  I'd give him up if he was to\r\n",
      "be boiled alive.  Murder! Help!  If there's the pluck of a man among\r\n",
      "you three, you'll help me.  Murder!  Help!  Down with him!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent\r\n",
      "gesticulation, the boy actually threw himself, single-handed, upon the\r\n",
      "strong man, and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of\r\n",
      "his surprise, brought him heavily to the ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The three spectators seemed quite stupefied.  They offered no\r\n",
      "interference, and the boy and man rolled on the ground together; the\r\n",
      "former, heedless of the blows that showered upon him, wrenching his\r\n",
      "hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer's breast,\r\n",
      "and never ceasing to call for help with all his might.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The contest, however, was too unequal to last long.  Sikes had him\r\n",
      "down, and his knee was on his throat, when Crackit pulled him back with\r\n",
      "a look of alarm, and pointed to the window.  There were lights gleaming\r\n",
      "below, voices in loud and earnest conversation, the tramp of hurried\r\n",
      "footsteps--endless they seemed in number--crossing the nearest wooden\r\n",
      "bridge.  One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd; for there\r\n",
      "was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement.  The gleam of\r\n",
      "lights increased; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on.\r\n",
      "Then, came a loud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur from\r\n",
      "such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Help!' shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'He's here!  Break down the door!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'In the King's name,' cried the voices without; and the hoarse cry\r\n",
      "arose again, but louder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Break down the door!' screamed the boy.  'I tell you they'll never\r\n",
      "open it.  Run straight to the room where the light is. Break down the\r\n",
      "door!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Strokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower\r\n",
      "window-shutters as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the\r\n",
      "crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of\r\n",
      "its immense extent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching\r\n",
      "Hell-babe,' cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the\r\n",
      "boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack. 'That door.  Quick!'\r\n",
      "He flung him in, bolted it, and turned the key.  'Is the downstairs\r\n",
      "door fast?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Double-locked and chained,' replied Crackit, who, with the other two\r\n",
      "men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The panels--are they strong?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Lined with sheet-iron.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And the windows too?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, and the windows.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Damn you!' cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and\r\n",
      "menacing the crowd.  'Do your worst!  I'll cheat you yet!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears, none could\r\n",
      "exceed the cry of the infuriated throng.  Some shouted to those who\r\n",
      "were nearest to set the house on fire; others roared to the officers to\r\n",
      "shoot him dead.  Among them all, none showed such fury as the man on\r\n",
      "horseback, who, throwing himself out of the saddle, and bursting\r\n",
      "through the crowd as if he were parting water, cried, beneath the\r\n",
      "window, in a voice that rose above all others, 'Twenty guineas to the\r\n",
      "man who brings a ladder!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The nearest voices took up the cry, and hundreds echoed it.  Some\r\n",
      "called for ladders, some for sledge-hammers; some ran with torches to\r\n",
      "and fro as if to seek them, and still came back and roared again; some\r\n",
      "spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations; some pressed\r\n",
      "forward with the ecstasy of madmen, and thus impeded the progress of\r\n",
      "those below; some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the\r\n",
      "water-spout and crevices in the wall; and all waved to and fro, in the\r\n",
      "darkness beneath, like a field of corn moved by an angry wind:  and\r\n",
      "joined from time to time in one loud furious roar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The tide,' cried the murderer, as he staggered back into the room, and\r\n",
      "shut the faces out, 'the tide was in as I came up. Give me a rope, a\r\n",
      "long rope.  They're all in front.  I may drop into the Folly Ditch, and\r\n",
      "clear off that way.  Give me a rope, or I shall do three more murders\r\n",
      "and kill myself.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept; the\r\n",
      "murderer, hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord, hurried up\r\n",
      "to the house-top.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All the window in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up,\r\n",
      "except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked, and that\r\n",
      "was too small even for the passage of his body.  But, from this\r\n",
      "aperture, he had never ceased to call on those without, to guard the\r\n",
      "back; and thus, when the murderer emerged at last on the house-top by\r\n",
      "the door in the roof, a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in\r\n",
      "front, who immediately began to pour round, pressing upon each other in\r\n",
      "an unbroken stream.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He planted a board, which he had carried up with him for the purpose,\r\n",
      "so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty\r\n",
      "to open it from the inside; and creeping over the tiles, looked over\r\n",
      "the low parapet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The water was out, and the ditch a bed of mud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The crowd had been hushed during these few moments, watching his\r\n",
      "motions and doubtful of his purpose, but the instant they perceived it\r\n",
      "and knew it was defeated, they raised a cry of triumphant execration to\r\n",
      "which all their previous shouting had been whispers.  Again and again\r\n",
      "it rose.  Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning,\r\n",
      "took up the sound; it echoed and re-echoed; it seemed as though the\r\n",
      "whole city had poured its population out to curse him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On pressed the people from the front--on, on, on, in a strong\r\n",
      "struggling current of angry faces, with here and there a glaring torch\r\n",
      "to lighten them up, and show them out in all their wrath and passion.\r\n",
      "The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the\r\n",
      "mob; sashes were thrown up, or torn bodily out; there were tiers and\r\n",
      "tiers of faces in every window; cluster upon cluster of people clinging\r\n",
      "to every house-top.  Each little bridge (and there were three in sight)\r\n",
      "bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it.  Still the current poured\r\n",
      "on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts, and only\r\n",
      "for an instant see the wretch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'They have him now,' cried a man on the nearest bridge. 'Hurrah!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The crowd grew light with uncovered heads; and again the shout uprose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I will give fifty pounds,' cried an old gentleman from the same\r\n",
      "quarter, 'to the man who takes him alive.  I will remain here, till he\r\n",
      "come to ask me for it.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was another roar.  At this moment the word was passed among the\r\n",
      "crowd that the door was forced at last, and that he who had first\r\n",
      "called for the ladder had mounted into the room.  The stream abruptly\r\n",
      "turned, as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth; and the people at\r\n",
      "the windows, seeing those upon the bridges pouring back, quitted their\r\n",
      "stations, and running into the street, joined the concourse that now\r\n",
      "thronged pell-mell to the spot they had left:  each man crushing and\r\n",
      "striving with his neighbor, and all panting with impatience to get near\r\n",
      "the door, and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out.\r\n",
      "The cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation,\r\n",
      "or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion, were\r\n",
      "dreadful; the narrow ways were completely blocked up; and at this time,\r\n",
      "between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house, and\r\n",
      "the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the\r\n",
      "mass, the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer,\r\n",
      "although the universal eagerness for his capture was, if possible,\r\n",
      "increased.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man had shrunk down, thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the\r\n",
      "crowd, and the impossibility of escape; but seeing this sudden change\r\n",
      "with no less rapidity than it had occurred, he sprang upon his feet,\r\n",
      "determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the\r\n",
      "ditch, and, at the risk of being stifled, endeavouring to creep away in\r\n",
      "the darkness and confusion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Roused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise within\r\n",
      "the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected, he\r\n",
      "set his foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of the\r\n",
      "rope tightly and firmly round it, and with the other made a strong\r\n",
      "running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second.  He\r\n",
      "could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the\r\n",
      "ground than his own height, and had his knife ready in his hand to cut\r\n",
      "it then and drop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to\r\n",
      "slipping it beneath his arm-pits, and when the old gentleman\r\n",
      "before-mentioned (who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge\r\n",
      "as to resist the force of the crowd, and retain his position) earnestly\r\n",
      "warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down--at\r\n",
      "that very instant the murderer, looking behind him on the roof, threw\r\n",
      "his arms above his head, and uttered a yell of terror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The eyes again!' he cried in an unearthly screech.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Staggering as if struck by lightning, he lost his balance and tumbled\r\n",
      "over the parapet.  The noose was on his neck. It ran up with his\r\n",
      "weight, tight as a bow-string, and swift as the arrow it speeds.  He\r\n",
      "fell for five-and-thirty feet.  There was a sudden jerk, a terrific\r\n",
      "convulsion of the limbs; and there he hung, with the open knife\r\n",
      "clenched in his stiffening hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely. The\r\n",
      "murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside\r\n",
      "the dangling body which obscured his view, called to the people to come\r\n",
      "and take him out, for God's sake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on\r\n",
      "the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring,\r\n",
      "jumped for the dead man's shoulders. Missing his aim, he fell into the\r\n",
      "ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head\r\n",
      "against a stone, dashed out his brains.\r\n",

      "The events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when\r\n",
      "Oliver found himself, at three o'clock in the afternoon, in a\r\n",
      "travelling-carriage rolling fast towards his native town.  Mrs. Maylie,\r\n",
      "and Rose, and Mrs. Bedwin, and the good doctor were with him:  and Mr.\r\n",
      "Brownlow followed in a post-chaise, accompanied by one other person\r\n",
      "whose name had not been mentioned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had not talked much upon the way; for Oliver was in a flutter of\r\n",
      "agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting\r\n",
      "his thoughts, and almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less\r\n",
      "effect on his companions, who shared it, in at least an equal degree.\r\n",
      "He and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr.\r\n",
      "Brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from\r\n",
      "Monks; and although they knew that the object of their present journey\r\n",
      "was to complete the work which had been so well begun, still the whole\r\n",
      "matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in\r\n",
      "endurance of the most intense suspense.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The same kind friend had, with Mr. Losberne's assistance, cautiously\r\n",
      "stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive\r\n",
      "intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place.\r\n",
      "'It was quite true,' he said, 'that they must know them before long,\r\n",
      "but it might be at a better time than the present, and it could not be\r\n",
      "at a worse.'  So, they travelled on in silence:  each busied with\r\n",
      "reflections on the object which had brought them together:  and no one\r\n",
      "disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But if Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while they\r\n",
      "journeyed towards his birth-place by a road he had never seen, how the\r\n",
      "whole current of his recollections ran back to old times, and what a\r\n",
      "crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast, when they turned into\r\n",
      "that which he had traversed on foot:  a poor houseless, wandering boy,\r\n",
      "without a friend to help him, or a roof to shelter his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'See there, there!' cried Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of Rose,\r\n",
      "and pointing out at the carriage window; 'that's the stile I came over;\r\n",
      "there are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any one should overtake\r\n",
      "me and force me back!  Yonder is the path across the fields, leading to\r\n",
      "the old house where I was a little child!  Oh Dick, Dick, my dear old\r\n",
      "friend, if I could only see you now!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You will see him soon,' replied Rose, gently taking his folded hands\r\n",
      "between her own.  'You shall tell him how happy you are, and how rich\r\n",
      "you have grown, and that in all your happiness you have none so great\r\n",
      "as the coming back to make him happy too.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, yes,' said Oliver, 'and we'll--we'll take him away from here, and\r\n",
      "have him clothed and taught, and send him to some quiet country place\r\n",
      "where he may grow strong and well,--shall we?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rose nodded 'yes,' for the boy was smiling through such happy tears\r\n",
      "that she could not speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one,' said\r\n",
      "Oliver.  'It will make you cry, I know, to hear what he can tell; but\r\n",
      "never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile\r\n",
      "again--I know that too--to think how changed he is; you did the same\r\n",
      "with me.  He said \"God bless you\" to me when I ran away,' cried the boy\r\n",
      "with a burst of affectionate emotion; 'and I will say \"God bless you\"\r\n",
      "now, and show him how I love him for it!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As they approached the town, and at length drove through its narrow\r\n",
      "streets, it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy\r\n",
      "within reasonable bounds.  There was Sowerberry's the undertaker's just\r\n",
      "as it used to be, only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he\r\n",
      "remembered it--there were all the well-known shops and houses, with\r\n",
      "almost every one of which he had some slight incident connected--there\r\n",
      "was Gamfield's cart, the very cart he used to have, standing at the old\r\n",
      "public-house door--there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of his\r\n",
      "youthful days, with its dismal windows frowning on the street--there\r\n",
      "was the same lean porter standing at the gate, at sight of whom Oliver\r\n",
      "involuntarily shrunk back, and then laughed at himself for being so\r\n",
      "foolish, then cried, then laughed again--there were scores of faces at\r\n",
      "the doors and windows that he knew quite well--there was nearly\r\n",
      "everything as if he had left it but yesterday, and all his recent life\r\n",
      "had been but a happy dream.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it was pure, earnest, joyful reality.  They drove straight to the\r\n",
      "door of the chief hotel (which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe,\r\n",
      "and think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur\r\n",
      "and size); and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing\r\n",
      "the young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as\r\n",
      "if he were the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness,\r\n",
      "and not offering to eat his head--no, not once; not even when he\r\n",
      "contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London, and\r\n",
      "maintained he knew it best, though he had only come that way once, and\r\n",
      "that time fast asleep.  There was dinner prepared, and there were\r\n",
      "bedrooms ready, and everything was arranged as if by magic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Notwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half-hour was\r\n",
      "over, the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their\r\n",
      "journey down.  Mr. Brownlow did not join them at dinner, but remained\r\n",
      "in a separate room.  The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with\r\n",
      "anxious faces, and, during the short intervals when they were present,\r\n",
      "conversed apart.  Once, Mrs. Maylie was called away, and after being\r\n",
      "absent for nearly an hour, returned with eyes swollen with weeping.\r\n",
      "All these things made Rose and Oliver, who were not in any new secrets,\r\n",
      "nervous and uncomfortable.  They sat wondering, in silence; or, if they\r\n",
      "exchanged a few words, spoke in whispers, as if they were afraid to\r\n",
      "hear the sound of their own voices.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length, when nine o'clock had come, and they began to think they\r\n",
      "were to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered\r\n",
      "the room, followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost\r\n",
      "shrieked with surprise to see; for they told him it was his brother,\r\n",
      "and it was the same man he had met at the market-town, and seen looking\r\n",
      "in with Fagin at the window of his little room.  Monks cast a look of\r\n",
      "hate, which, even then, he could not dissemble, at the astonished boy,\r\n",
      "and sat down near the door.  Mr. Brownlow, who had papers in his hand,\r\n",
      "walked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This is a painful task,' said he, 'but these declarations, which have\r\n",
      "been signed in London before many gentlemen, must be in substance\r\n",
      "repeated here.  I would have spared you the degradation, but we must\r\n",
      "hear them from your own lips before we part, and you know why.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Go on,' said the person addressed, turning away his face. 'Quick.  I\r\n",
      "have almost done enough, I think.  Don't keep me here.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This child,' said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and laying his\r\n",
      "hand upon his head, 'is your half-brother; the illegitimate son of your\r\n",
      "father, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who\r\n",
      "died in giving him birth.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,' said Monks, scowling at the trembling boy:  the beating of whose\r\n",
      "heart he might have heard.  'That is the bastard child.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The term you use,' said Mr. Brownlow, sternly, 'is a reproach to those\r\n",
      "long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world. It reflects\r\n",
      "disgrace on no one living, except you who use it. Let that pass.  He\r\n",
      "was born in this town.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'In the workhouse of this town,' was the sullen reply. 'You have the\r\n",
      "story there.'  He pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I must have it here, too,' said Mr. Brownlow, looking round upon the\r\n",
      "listeners.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Listen then!  You!' returned Monks.  'His father being taken ill at\r\n",
      "Rome, was joined by his wife, my mother, from whom he had been long\r\n",
      "separated, who went from Paris and took me with her--to look after his\r\n",
      "property, for what I know, for she had no great affection for him, nor\r\n",
      "he for her.  He knew nothing of us, for his senses were gone, and he\r\n",
      "slumbered on till next day, when he died.  Among the papers in his\r\n",
      "desk, were two, dated on the night his illness first came on, directed\r\n",
      "to yourself'; he addressed himself to Mr. Brownlow; 'and enclosed in a\r\n",
      "few short lines to you, with an intimation on the cover of the package\r\n",
      "that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead.  One of these\r\n",
      "papers was a letter to this girl Agnes; the other a will.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'What of the letter?' asked Mr. Brownlow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The letter?--A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again, with a\r\n",
      "penitent confession, and prayers to God to help her.  He had palmed a\r\n",
      "tale on the girl that some secret mystery--to be explained one\r\n",
      "day--prevented his marrying her just then; and so she had gone on,\r\n",
      "trusting patiently to him, until she trusted too far, and lost what\r\n",
      "none could ever give her back.  She was, at that time, within a few\r\n",
      "months of her confinement.  He told her all he had meant to do, to hide\r\n",
      "her shame, if he had lived, and prayed her, if he died, not to curse\r\n",
      "his memory, or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on\r\n",
      "her or their young child; for all the guilt was his.  He reminded her\r\n",
      "of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her\r\n",
      "christian name engraved upon it, and a blank left for that which he\r\n",
      "hoped one day to have bestowed upon her--prayed her yet to keep it, and\r\n",
      "wear it next her heart, as she had done before--and then ran on,\r\n",
      "wildly, in the same words, over and over again, as if he had gone\r\n",
      "distracted.  I believe he had.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The will,' said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver's tears fell fast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Monks was silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The will,' said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him, 'was in the same\r\n",
      "spirit as the letter.  He talked of miseries which his wife had brought\r\n",
      "upon him; of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature\r\n",
      "bad passions of you his only son, who had been trained to hate him; and\r\n",
      "left you, and your mother, each an annuity of eight hundred pounds.\r\n",
      "The bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions--one for\r\n",
      "Agnes Fleming, and the other for their child, if it should be born\r\n",
      "alive, and ever come of age.  If it were a girl, it was to inherit the\r\n",
      "money unconditionally; but if a boy, only on the stipulation that in\r\n",
      "his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act\r\n",
      "of dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong.  He did this, he said, to\r\n",
      "mark his confidence in the other, and his conviction--only strengthened\r\n",
      "by approaching death--that the child would share her gentle heart, and\r\n",
      "noble nature.  If he were disappointed in this expectation, then the\r\n",
      "money was to come to you:  for then, and not till then, when both\r\n",
      "children were equal, would he recognise your prior claim upon his\r\n",
      "purse, who had none upon his heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed\r\n",
      "him with coldness and aversion.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'My mother,' said Monks, in a louder tone, 'did what a woman should\r\n",
      "have done.  She burnt this will.  The letter never reached its\r\n",
      "destination; but that, and other proofs, she kept, in case they ever\r\n",
      "tried to lie away the blot.  The girl's father had the truth from her\r\n",
      "with every aggravation that her violent hate--I love her for it\r\n",
      "now--could add.  Goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his\r\n",
      "children into a remote corner of Wales, changing his very name that his\r\n",
      "friends might never know of his retreat; and here, no great while\r\n",
      "afterwards, he was found dead in his bed.  The girl had left her home,\r\n",
      "in secret, some weeks before; he had searched for her, on foot, in\r\n",
      "every town and village near; it was on the night when he returned home,\r\n",
      "assured that she had destroyed herself, to hide her shame and his, that\r\n",
      "his old heart broke.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a short silence here, until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread\r\n",
      "of the narrative.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Years after this,' he said, 'this man's--Edward Leeford's--mother came\r\n",
      "to me.  He had left her, when only eighteen; robbed her of jewels and\r\n",
      "money; gambled, squandered, forged, and fled to London:  where for two\r\n",
      "years he had associated with the lowest outcasts.  She was sinking\r\n",
      "under a painful and incurable disease, and wished to recover him before\r\n",
      "she died.  Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made. They\r\n",
      "were unavailing for a long time, but ultimately successful; and he went\r\n",
      "back with her to France.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'There she died,' said Monks, 'after a lingering illness; and, on her\r\n",
      "death-bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her\r\n",
      "unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved--though she\r\n",
      "need not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before.  She\r\n",
      "would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself, and the child\r\n",
      "too, but was filled with the impression that a male child had been\r\n",
      "born, and was alive.  I swore to her, if ever it crossed my path, to\r\n",
      "hunt it down; never to let it rest; to pursue it with the bitterest and\r\n",
      "most unrelenting animosity; to vent upon it the hatred that I deeply\r\n",
      "felt, and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by\r\n",
      "draggin it, if I could, to the very gallows-foot.  She was right. He\r\n",
      "came in my way at last.  I began well; and, but for babbling drabs, I\r\n",
      "would have finished as I began!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the villain folded his arms tight together, and muttered curses on\r\n",
      "himself in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr. Brownlow turned to the\r\n",
      "terrified group beside him, and explained that the Jew, who had been\r\n",
      "his old accomplice and confidant, had a large reward for keeping Oliver\r\n",
      "ensnared:  of which some part was to be given up, in the event of his\r\n",
      "being rescued:  and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit\r\n",
      "to the country house for the purpose of identifying him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The locket and ring?' said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Monks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole them\r\n",
      "from the nurse, who stole them from the corpse,' answered Monks without\r\n",
      "raising his eyes.  'You know what became of them.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with great\r\n",
      "alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and dragging her\r\n",
      "unwilling consort after him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do my hi's deceive me!' cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned enthusiasm,\r\n",
      "'or is that little Oliver?  Oh O-li-ver, if you know'd how I've been\r\n",
      "a-grieving for you--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Hold your tongue, fool,' murmured Mrs. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Isn't natur, natur, Mrs. Bumble?' remonstrated the workhouse master.\r\n",
      "'Can't I be supposed to feel--_I_ as brought him up porochially--when I\r\n",
      "see him a-setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest\r\n",
      "description!  I always loved that boy as if he'd been my--my--my own\r\n",
      "grandfather,' said Mr. Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison.\r\n",
      "'Master Oliver, my dear, you remember the blessed gentleman in the\r\n",
      "white waistcoat?  Ah! he went to heaven last week, in a oak coffin with\r\n",
      "plated handles, Oliver.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Come, sir,' said Mr. Grimwig, tartly; 'suppress your feelings.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I will do my endeavours, sir,' replied Mr. Bumble.  'How do you do,\r\n",
      "sir?  I hope you are very well.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This salutation was addressed to Mr. Brownlow, who had stepped up to\r\n",
      "within a short distance of the respectable couple.  He inquired, as he\r\n",
      "pointed to Monks,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Do you know that person?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' replied Mrs. Bumble flatly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Perhaps _you_ don't?' said Mr. Brownlow, addressing her spouse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I never saw him in all my life,' said Mr. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nor sold him anything, perhaps?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' replied Mrs. Bumble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?' said Mr.\r\n",
      "Brownlow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Certainly not,' replied the matron.  'Why are we brought here to\r\n",
      "answer to such nonsense as this?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig; and again that gentleman\r\n",
      "limped away with extraordinary readiness.  But not again did he return\r\n",
      "with a stout man and wife; for this time, he led in two palsied women,\r\n",
      "who shook and tottered as they walked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You shut the door the night old Sally died,' said the foremost one,\r\n",

      "stop the chinks.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No, no,' said the other, looking round her and wagging her toothless\r\n",
      "jaws.  'No, no, no.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'We heard her try to tell you what she'd done, and saw you take a paper\r\n",
      "from her hand, and watched you too, next day, to the pawnbroker's\r\n",
      "shop,' said the first.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes,' added the second, 'and it was a \"locket and gold ring.\" We found\r\n",
      "out that, and saw it given you.  We were by.  Oh! we were by.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'And we know more than that,' resumed the first, 'for she told us\r\n",
      "often, long ago, that the young mother had told her that, feeling she\r\n",
      "should never get over it, she was on her way, at the time that she was\r\n",
      "taken ill, to die near the grave of the father of the child.'\r\n",

      "a motion towards the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No,' replied the woman; 'if he'--she pointed to Monks--'has been coward\r\n",
      "enough to confess, as I see he has, and you have sounded all these hags\r\n",
      "till you have found the right ones, I have nothing more to say.  I\r\n",
      "_did_ sell them, and they're where you'll never get them.  What then?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing,' replied Mr. Brownlow, 'except that it remains for us to take\r\n",

      "Mr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women: 'I hope that this\r\n",

      "looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That is no excuse,' replied Mr. Brownlow.  'You were present on the\r\n",
      "occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and indeed are the more\r\n",
      "guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that\r\n",
      "your wife acts under your direction.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'If the law supposes that,' said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat\r\n",
      "emphatically in both hands, 'the law is a ass--a idiot.  If that's the\r\n",
      "eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is,\r\n",
      "that his eye may be opened by experience--by experience.'\r\n",

      "Laying great stress on the repetition of these two words, Mr. Bumble\r\n",
      "fixed his hat on very tight, and putting his hands in his pockets,\r\n",
      "followed his helpmate downstairs.\r\n",

      "have to say.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "'The father of the unhappy Agnes had _two_ daughters,' said Mr.\r\n",
      "Brownlow.  'What was the fate of the other--the child?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The child,' replied Monks, 'when her father died in a strange place,\r\n",
      "in a strange name, without a letter, book, or scrap of paper that\r\n",
      "yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be\r\n",
      "traced--the child was taken by some wretched cottagers, who reared it\r\n",
      "as their own.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Go on,' said Mr. Brownlow, signing to Mrs. Maylie to approach. 'Go on!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You couldn't find the spot to which these people had repaired,' said\r\n",
      "Monks, 'but where friendship fails, hatred will often force a way.  My\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "'No.  The people were poor and began to sicken--at least the man\r\n",
      "did--of their fine humanity; so she left it with them, giving them a\r\n",
      "small present of money which would not last long, and promised more,\r\n",
      "which she never meant to send.  She didn't quite rely, however, on\r\n",
      "their discontent and poverty for the child's unhappiness, but told the\r\n",
      "history of the sister's shame, with such alterations as suited her;\r\n",
      "bade them take good heed of the child, for she came of bad blood; and\r\n",
      "told them she was illegitimate, and sure to go wrong at one time or\r\n",
      "other.  The circumstances countenanced all this; the people believed\r\n",
      "it; and there the child dragged on an existence, miserable enough even\r\n",
      "to satisfy us, until a widow lady, residing, then, at Chester, saw the\r\n",
      "girl by chance, pitied her, and took her home.  There was some cursed\r\n",
      "spell, I think, against us; for in spite of all our efforts she\r\n",
      "remained there and was happy.  I lost sight of her, two or three years\r\n",

      "Let the tears which fell, and the broken words which were exchanged in\r\n",
      "the long close embrace between the orphans, be sacred.  A father,\r\n",
      "sister, and mother, were gained, and lost, in that one moment.  Joy and\r\n",
      "grief were mingled in the cup; but there were no bitter tears:  for\r\n",
      "even grief itself arose so softened, and clothed in such sweet and\r\n",
      "tender recollections, that it became a solemn pleasure, and lost all\r\n",
      "character of pain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were a long, long time alone.  A soft tap at the door, at length\r\n",
      "announced that some one was without.  Oliver opened it, glided away,\r\n",
      "and gave place to Harry Maylie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "from it.  This I have done.  Those who have shrunk from me because of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces. Inquisitive\r\n",
      "and eager eyes peered from every inch of space. From the rail before\r\n",
      "the dock, away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the\r\n",
      "galleries, all looks were fixed upon one man--Fagin.  Before him and\r\n",
      "behind:  above, below, on the right and on the left:  he seemed to\r\n",
      "stand surrounded by a firmament, all bright with gleaming eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand\r\n",
      "resting on the wooden slab before him, the other held to his ear, and\r\n",
      "his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater\r\n",
      "distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge, who was\r\n",
      "delivering his charge to the jury.  At times, he turned his eyes\r\n",
      "sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight\r\n",
      "in his favour; and when the points against him were stated with\r\n",
      "terrible distinctness, looked towards his counsel, in mute appeal that\r\n",
      "he would, even then, urge something in his behalf.  Beyond these\r\n",
      "manifestations of anxiety, he stirred not hand or foot.  He had\r\n",
      "scarcely moved since the trial began; and now that the judge ceased to\r\n",
      "speak, he still remained in the same strained attitude of close\r\n",
      "attention, with his gaze bent on him, as though he listened still.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself.  Looking round,\r\n",
      "he saw that the juryman had turned together, to consider their verdict.\r\n",
      "As his eyes wandered to the gallery, he could see the people rising\r\n",
      "above each other to see his face:  some hastily applying their glasses\r\n",
      "to their eyes:  and others whispering their neighbours with looks\r\n",
      "expressive of abhorrence.  A few there were, who seemed unmindful of\r\n",
      "him, and looked only to the jury, in impatient wonder how they could\r\n",
      "delay.  But in no one face--not even among the women, of whom there\r\n",
      "were many there--could he read the faintest sympathy with himself, or\r\n",
      "any feeling but one of all-absorbing interest that he should be\r\n",
      "condemned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike stillness\r\n",

      "the judge.  Hush!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They only sought permission to retire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed\r\n",
      "out, as though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was\r\n",
      "fruitless.  The jailer touched him on the shoulder. He followed\r\n",
      "mechanically to the end of the dock, and sat down on a chair.  The man\r\n",
      "pointed it out, or he would not have seen it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked up into the gallery again.  Some of the people were eating,\r\n",
      "and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place\r\n",
      "was very hot.  There was one young man sketching his face in a little\r\n",
      "note-book.  He wondered whether it was like, and looked on when the\r\n",
      "artist broke his pencil-point, and made another with his knife, as any\r\n",
      "idle spectator might have done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the same way, when he turned his eyes towards the judge, his mind\r\n",
      "began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress, and what it cost,\r\n",
      "and how he put it on.  There was an old fat gentleman on the bench,\r\n",
      "too, who had gone out, some half an hour before, and now come back.  He\r\n",
      "wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner,\r\n",
      "what he had had, and where he had had it; and pursued this train of\r\n",
      "careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused\r\n",
      "another.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not that, all this time, his mind was, for an instant, free from one\r\n",
      "oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet; it\r\n",
      "was ever present to him, but in a vague and general way, and he could\r\n",
      "not fix his thoughts upon it.  Thus, even while he trembled, and turned\r\n",
      "burning hot at the idea of speedy death, he fell to counting the iron\r\n",
      "spikes before him, and wondering how the head of one had been broken\r\n",
      "off, and whether they would mend it, or leave it as it was.  Then, he\r\n",
      "thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold--and stopped\r\n",
      "to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it--and then went on to\r\n",
      "think again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from all\r\n",
      "towards the door.  The jury returned, and passed him close. He could\r\n",
      "glean nothing from their faces; they might as well have been of stone.\r\n",
      "Perfect stillness ensued--not a rustle--not a breath--Guilty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and another,\r\n",
      "and then it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength as they swelled\r\n",
      "out, like angry thunder.  It was a peal of joy from the populace\r\n",
      "outside, greeting the news that he would die on Monday.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The noise subsided, and he was asked if he had anything to say why\r\n",
      "sentence of death should not be passed upon him. He had resumed his\r\n",
      "listening attitude, and looked intently at his questioner while the\r\n",
      "demand was made; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it,\r\n",
      "and then he only muttered that he was an old man--an old man--and so,\r\n",
      "dropping into a whisper, was silent again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the\r\n",
      "same air and gesture.  A woman in the gallery, uttered some\r\n",
      "exclamation, called forth by this dread solemnity; he looked hastily up\r\n",
      "as if angry at the interruption, and bent forward yet more attentively.\r\n",
      "The address was solemn and impressive; the sentence fearful to hear.\r\n",
      "But he stood, like a marble figure, without the motion of a nerve.  His\r\n",
      "haggard face was still thrust forward, his under-jaw hanging down, and\r\n",
      "his eyes staring out before him, when the jailer put his hand upon his\r\n",
      "arm, and beckoned him away.  He gazed stupidly about him for an\r\n",

      "friends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard.\r\n",
      "There was nobody there to speak to _him_; but, as he passed, the\r\n",
      "prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were\r\n",
      "clinging to the bars:  and they assailed him with opprobrious names,\r\n",
      "and screeched and hissed.  He shook his fist, and would have spat upon\r\n",

      "lighted by a few dim lamps, into the interior of the prison.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "and bedstead; and casting his blood-shot eyes upon the ground, tried to\r\n",
      "collect his thoughts. After awhile, he began to remember a few\r\n",
      "disjointed fragments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed\r\n",
      "to him, at the time, that he could not hear a word.  These gradually\r\n",
      "fell into their proper places, and by degrees suggested more:  so that\r\n",
      "in a little time he had the whole, almost as it was delivered.  To be\r\n",
      "hanged by the neck, till he was dead--that was the end.  To be hanged\r\n",
      "by the neck till he was dead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had known\r\n",
      "who had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his means.  They\r\n",
      "rose up, in such quick succession, that he could hardly count them.  He\r\n",
      "had seen some of them die,--and had joked too, because they died with\r\n",
      "prayers upon their lips.  With what a rattling noise the drop went\r\n",
      "down; and how suddenly they changed, from strong and vigorous men to\r\n",
      "dangling heaps of clothes!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some of them might have inhabited that very cell--sat upon that very\r\n",
      "spot.  It was very dark; why didn't they bring a light?  The cell had\r\n",
      "been built for many years.  Scores of men must have passed their last\r\n",
      "hours there.  It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead\r\n",
      "bodies--the cap, the noose, the pinioned arms, the faces that he knew,\r\n",
      "even beneath that hideous veil.--Light, light!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length, when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door\r\n",
      "and walls, two men appeared:  one bearing a candle, which he thrust\r\n",
      "into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall:  the other dragging in\r\n",
      "a mattress on which to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left\r\n",
      "alone no more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then came the night--dark, dismal, silent night.  Other watchers are\r\n",
      "glad to hear this church-clock strike, for they tell of life and coming\r\n",
      "day.  To him they brought despair.  The boom of every iron bell came\r\n",
      "laden with the one, deep, hollow sound--Death. What availed the noise\r\n",
      "and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him?\r\n",
      "It was another form of knell, with mockery added to the warning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The day passed off.  Day?  There was no day; it was gone as soon as\r\n",
      "come--and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in\r\n",
      "its dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting hours.  At one time he\r\n",
      "raved and blasphemed; and at another howled and tore his hair.\r\n",
      "Venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him, but he\r\n",
      "had driven them away with curses.  They renewed their charitable\r\n",
      "efforts, and he beat them off.\r\n",

      "of this, the day broke--Sunday.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering\r\n",
      "sense of his helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon\r\n",
      "his blighted soul; not that he had ever held any defined or positive\r\n",
      "hope of mercy, but that he had never been able to consider more than\r\n",
      "the dim probability of dying so soon. He had spoken little to either of\r\n",
      "the two men, who relieved each other in their attendance upon him; and\r\n",
      "they, for their parts, made no effort to rouse his attention.  He had\r\n",
      "sat there, awake, but dreaming.  Now, he started up, every minute, and\r\n",
      "with gasping mouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a\r\n",
      "paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they--used to such\r\n",
      "sights--recoiled from him with horror.  He grew so terrible, at last,\r\n",
      "in all the tortures of his evil conscience, that one man could not bear\r\n",
      "to sit there, eyeing him alone; and so the two kept watch together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past. He had\r\n",
      "been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his\r\n",
      "capture, and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth.  His red hair\r\n",
      "hung down upon his bloodless face; his beard was torn, and twisted into\r\n",
      "knots; his eyes shone with a terrible light; his unwashed flesh\r\n",
      "crackled with the fever that burnt him up. Eight--nine--then.  If it\r\n",
      "was not a trick to frighten him, and those were the real hours treading\r\n",
      "on each other's heels, where would he be, when they came round again!\r\n",
      "Eleven!  Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had\r\n",
      "ceased to vibrate.  At eight, he would be the only mourner in his own\r\n",
      "funeral train; at eleven--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Those dreadful walls of Newgate, which have hidden so much misery and\r\n",
      "such unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and\r\n",
      "too long, from the thoughts, of men, never held so dread a spectacle as\r\n",
      "that.  The few who lingered as they passed, and wondered what the man\r\n",
      "was doing who was to be hanged to-morrow, would have slept but ill that\r\n",
      "night, if they could have seen him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of two\r\n",
      "and three presented themselves at the lodge-gate, and inquired, with\r\n",
      "anxious faces, whether any reprieve had been received.  These being\r\n",
      "answered in the negative, communicated the welcome intelligence to\r\n",
      "clusters in the street, who pointed out to one another the door from\r\n",
      "which he must come out, and showed where the scaffold would be built,\r\n",
      "and, walking with unwilling steps away, turned back to conjure up the\r\n",
      "scene.  By degrees they fell off, one by one; and, for an hour, in the\r\n",
      "dead of night, the street was left to solitude and darkness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers,\r\n",
      "painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the\r\n",
      "pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared\r\n",
      "at the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner,\r\n",
      "signed by one of the sheriffs.  They were immediately admitted into the\r\n",
      "lodge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?' said the man whose duty it\r\n",
      "was to conduct them.  'It's not a sight for children, sir.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It is not indeed, my friend,' rejoined Mr. Brownlow; 'but my business\r\n",
      "with this man is intimately connected with him; and as this child has\r\n",
      "seen him in the full career of his success and villainy, I think it as\r\n",
      "well--even at the cost of some pain and fear--that he should see him\r\n",
      "now.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver.\r\n",
      "The man touched his hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity,\r\n",
      "opened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and\r\n",
      "led them on, through dark and winding ways, towards the cells.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'This,' said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of\r\n",
      "workmen were making some preparations in profound silence--'this is the\r\n",

      "goes out at.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the\r\n",
      "prison food, and pointed to a door.  There was an open grating above\r\n",
      "it, through which came the sound of men's voices, mingled with the\r\n",
      "noise of hammering, and the throwing down of boards.  They were\r\n",
      "putting up the scaffold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened by\r\n",
      "other turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an open yard,\r\n",
      "ascended a flight of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a row\r\n",
      "of strong doors on the left hand.  Motioning them to remain where they\r\n",
      "were, the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys. The\r\n",
      "two attendants, after a little whispering, came out into the passage,\r\n",
      "stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief, and motioned\r\n",
      "the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell.  They did so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The condemned criminal was seated on his bed, rocking himself from side\r\n",
      "to side, with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the\r\n",
      "face of a man.  His mind was evidently wandering to his old life, for\r\n",
      "he continued to mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence\r\n",
      "otherwise than as a part of his vision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "bed!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "to be alarmed, looked on without speaking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Take him away to bed!' cried Fagin.  'Do you hear me, some of you?  He\r\n",
      "has been the--the--somehow the cause of all this.  It's worth the money\r\n",
      "to bring him up to it--Bolter's throat, Bill; never mind the\r\n",
      "girl--Bolter's throat as deep as you can cut.  Saw his head off!'\r\n",

      "listening he had assumed upon his trial.  'An old man, my Lord; a very\r\n",
      "old, old man!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Here,' said the turnkey, laying his hand upon his breast to keep him\r\n",
      "down.  'Here's somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I\r\n",
      "suppose.  Fagin, Fagin!  Are you a man?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'I shan't be one long,' he replied, looking up with a face retaining no\r\n",
      "human expression but rage and terror.  'Strike them all dead!  What\r\n",
      "right have they to butcher me?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow. Shrinking to\r\n",
      "the furthest corner of the seat, he demanded to know what they wanted\r\n",
      "there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Steady,' said the turnkey, still holding him down.  'Now, sir, tell\r\n",
      "him what you want.  Quick, if you please, for he grows worse as the\r\n",
      "time gets on.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'You have some papers,' said Mr. Brownlow advancing, 'which were placed\r\n",
      "in your hands, for better security, by a man called Monks.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'It's all a lie together,' replied Fagin.  'I haven't one--not one.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'For the love of God,' said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, 'do not say that\r\n",
      "now, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are.  You\r\n",
      "know that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no\r\n",
      "hope of any further gain.  Where are those papers?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "to you.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Brownlow's hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'The papers,' said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, 'are in a canvas\r\n",
      "bag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front-room.  I\r\n",
      "want to talk to you, my dear.  I want to talk to you.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Yes, yes,' returned Oliver.  'Let me say a prayer.  Do!  Let me say\r\n",
      "one prayer.  Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk\r\n",
      "till morning.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Outside, outside,' replied Fagin, pushing the boy before him towards\r\n",
      "the door, and looking vacantly over his head. 'Say I've gone to\r\n",
      "sleep--they'll believe you.  You can get me out, if you take me so.\r\n",
      "Now then, now then!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Oh!  God forgive this wretched man!' cried the boy with a burst of\r\n",
      "tears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'That's right, that's right,' said Fagin.  'That'll help us on. This\r\n",
      "door first.  If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don't you\r\n",
      "mind, but hurry on.  Now, now, now!'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?' inquired the turnkey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'No other question,' replied Mr. Brownlow.  'If I hoped we could recall\r\n",
      "him to a sense of his position--'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "'Nothing will do that, sir,' replied the man, shaking his head. 'You\r\n",
      "had better leave him.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned.\r\n",

So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.\\r\\n\\r\\nI give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his\\r\\ntombstone and my sister,--Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.\\r\\nAs I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness\\r\\nof either of them (for their days were long before the days of\\r\\nphotographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were\\r\\nunreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on\\r\\nmy father's, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,\\r\\nwith curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAlso Georgiana Wife of the Above,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I drew a childish conclusion that\\r\\nmy mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each\\r\\nabout a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside\\r\\ntheir grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of\\r\\nmine,--who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in\\r\\nthat universal struggle,--I am indebted for a belief I religiously\\r\\nentertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands\\r\\nin their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of\\r\\nexistence.\\r\\n\\r\\nOurs was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river\\r\\nwound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression\\r\\nof the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable\\r\\nraw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain\\r\\nthat this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and\\r\\nthat Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the\\r\\nabove, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham,\\r\\nTobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead\\r\\nand buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard,\\r\\nintersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle\\r\\nfeeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond\\r\\nwas the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was\\r\\nrushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid\\r\\nof it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHold your noise!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from\\r\\namong the graves at the side of the church porch. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cKeep still, you\\r\\nlittle devil, or I'll cut your throat!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA fearful man, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on his leg. A man\\r\\nwith no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his\\r\\nhead. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and\\r\\nlamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by\\r\\nbriars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose\\r\\nteeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh! Don't cut my throat, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I pleaded in terror. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPray don't do it,\\r\\nsir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTell us your name!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the man. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cQuick!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPip, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOnce more,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the man, staring at me. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGive it mouth!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPip. Pip, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShow us where you live,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the man. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPint out the place!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the\\r\\nalder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and\\r\\nemptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread. When\\r\\nthe church came to itself,--for he was so sudden and strong that he\\r\\nmade it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my\\r\\nfeet,--when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high\\r\\ntombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou young dog,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the man, licking his lips, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat fat cheeks you\\r\\nha' got.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my\\r\\nyears, and not strong.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDarn me if I couldn't eat em,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the man, with a threatening shake\\r\\nof his head, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand if I han't half a mind to't!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn't, and held tighter to\\r\\nthe tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it;\\r\\npartly, to keep myself from crying.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow lookee here!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the man. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhere's your mother?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere, sir!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere, sir!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I timidly explained. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAlso Georgiana. That's my mother.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, coming back. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd is that your father alonger your\\r\\nmother?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I; Ã¢\\x80\\x9chim too; late of this parish.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHa!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he muttered then, considering. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWho d'ye live with,--supposin'\\r\\nyou're kindly let to live, which I han't made up my mind about?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy sister, sir,--Mrs. Joe Gargery,--wife of Joe Gargery, the\\r\\nblacksmith, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBlacksmith, eh?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he. And looked down at his leg.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer\\r\\nto my tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he\\r\\ncould hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine,\\r\\nand mine looked most helplessly up into his.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow lookee here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe question being whether you're to be let\\r\\nto live. You know what a file is?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd you know what wittles is?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a\\r\\ngreater sense of helplessness and danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou get me a file.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He tilted me again. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd you get me wittles.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He\\r\\ntilted me again. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou bring 'em both to me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He tilted me again. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOr\\r\\nI'll have your heart and liver out.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He tilted me again.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both\\r\\nhands, and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf you would kindly please to let me keep upright,\\r\\nsir, perhaps I shouldn't be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped\\r\\nover its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright\\r\\nposition on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You\\r\\nbring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and you\\r\\nnever dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having\\r\\nseen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall be let to\\r\\nlive. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no matter how\\r\\nsmall it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore out, roasted,\\r\\nand ate. Now, I ain't alone, as you may think I am. There's a young man\\r\\nhid with me, in comparison with which young man I am a Angel. That young\\r\\nman hears the words I speak. That young man has a secret way pecooliar\\r\\nto himself, of getting at a boy, and at his heart, and at his liver. It\\r\\nis in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man. A\\r\\nboy may lock his door, may be warm in bed, may tuck himself up, may draw\\r\\nthe clothes over his head, may think himself comfortable and safe, but\\r\\nthat young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him\\r\\nopen. I am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present\\r\\nmoment, with great difficulty. I find it wery hard to hold that young\\r\\nman off of your inside. Now, what do you say?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken\\r\\nbits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in\\r\\nthe morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSay Lord strike you dead if you don't!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said so, and he took me down.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he pursued, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou remember what you've undertook, and you remember\\r\\nthat young man, and you get home!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGoo-good night, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I faltered.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMuch of that!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nwish I was a frog. Or a eel!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his\\r\\narms,--clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,--and limped\\r\\ntowards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among the\\r\\nnettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked\\r\\nin my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people,\\r\\nstretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his\\r\\nankle and pull him in.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose\\r\\nlegs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When I\\r\\nsaw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of\\r\\nmy legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on\\r\\nagain towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and picking\\r\\nhis way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the\\r\\nmarshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were heavy or\\r\\nthe tide was in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped\\r\\nto look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, not\\r\\nnearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long\\r\\nangry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the\\r\\nriver I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the\\r\\nprospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the beacon\\r\\nby which the sailors steered,--like an unhooped cask upon a pole,--an\\r\\nugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with some chains\\r\\nhanging to it which had once held a pirate. The man was limping on\\r\\ntowards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life, and come\\r\\ndown, and going back to hook himself up again. It gave me a terrible\\r\\nturn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their heads to\\r\\ngaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too. I looked all\\r\\nround for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of him. But now\\r\\nI was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter II\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I,\\r\\nand had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors\\r\\nbecause she had brought me up Ã¢\\x80\\x9cby hand.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Having at that time to find out\\r\\nfor myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a hard and\\r\\nheavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as\\r\\nwell as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up\\r\\nby hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general\\r\\nimpression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand. Joe\\r\\nwas a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth\\r\\nface, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed\\r\\nto have somehow got mixed with their own whites. He was a mild,\\r\\ngood-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,--a sort\\r\\nof Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing\\r\\nredness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible\\r\\nshe washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She was tall\\r\\nand bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her\\r\\nfigure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in\\r\\nfront, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerful\\r\\nmerit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this\\r\\napron so much. Though I really see no reason why she should have worn it\\r\\nat all; or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have taken it\\r\\noff, every day of her life.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe's forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of the\\r\\ndwellings in our country were,--most of them, at that time. When I ran\\r\\nhome from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was sitting\\r\\nalone in the kitchen. Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, and having\\r\\nconfidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment I\\r\\nraised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it,\\r\\nsitting in the chimney corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMrs. Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And she's\\r\\nout now, making it a baker's dozen.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs she?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand what's worse, she's got Tickler with her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat\\r\\nround and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler\\r\\nwas a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled\\r\\nframe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe sot down,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand she got up, and she made a grab at\\r\\nTickler, and she Ram-paged out. That's what she did,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, slowly\\r\\nclearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at\\r\\nit; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cshe Ram-paged out, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHas she been gone long, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I always treated him as a larger species\\r\\nof child, and as no more than my equal.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cshe's been on the\\r\\nRam-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. She's a coming! Get\\r\\nbehind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,\\r\\nand finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause, and\\r\\napplied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded by throwing\\r\\nme--I often served as a connubial missile--at Joe, who, glad to get hold\\r\\nof me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me\\r\\nup there with his great leg.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhere have you been, you young monkey?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Joe, stamping her\\r\\nfoot. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTell me directly what you've been doing to wear me away with fret\\r\\nand fright and worrit, or I'd have you out of that corner if you was\\r\\nfifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have only been to the churchyard,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, from my stool, crying and\\r\\nrubbing myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cChurchyard!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated my sister. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf it warn't for me you'd have been\\r\\nto the churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you up by\\r\\nhand?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou did,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd why did I do it, I should like to know?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed my sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nI whimpered, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my sister. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'd never do it again! I know that. I may\\r\\ntruly say I've never had this apron of mine off since born you were.\\r\\nIt's bad enough to be a blacksmith's wife (and him a Gargery) without\\r\\nbeing your mother.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at\\r\\nthe fire. For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the\\r\\nmysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was\\r\\nunder to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me\\r\\nin the avenging coals.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHah!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cChurchyard,\\r\\nindeed! You may well say churchyard, you two.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d One of us, by the by, had\\r\\nnot said it at all. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou'll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you, one\\r\\nof these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you'd be without me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me\\r\\nover his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and\\r\\ncalculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the\\r\\ngrievous circumstances foreshadowed. After that, he sat feeling his\\r\\nright-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with\\r\\nhis blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,\\r\\nthat never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard\\r\\nand fast against her bib,--where it sometimes got a pin into it, and\\r\\nsometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she\\r\\ntook some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf, in\\r\\nan apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,--using both\\r\\nsides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and moulding\\r\\nthe butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a final smart\\r\\nwipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very thick round off\\r\\nthe loaf: which she finally, before separating from the loaf, hewed into\\r\\ntwo halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my\\r\\nslice. I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful\\r\\nacquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew\\r\\nMrs. Joe's housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my\\r\\nlarcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe. Therefore\\r\\nI resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my\\r\\ntrousers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I\\r\\nfound to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap\\r\\nfrom the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.\\r\\nAnd it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In\\r\\nour already-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his\\r\\ngood-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare\\r\\nthe way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each\\r\\nother's admiration now and then,--which stimulated us to new exertions.\\r\\nTo-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast\\r\\ndiminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but\\r\\nhe found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and\\r\\nmy untouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperately\\r\\nconsidered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it\\r\\nhad best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the\\r\\ncircumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at\\r\\nme, and got my bread and butter down my leg.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss\\r\\nof appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he\\r\\ndidn't seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much longer than\\r\\nusual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like\\r\\na pill. He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on\\r\\none side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw\\r\\nthat my bread and butter was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold\\r\\nof his bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister's\\r\\nobservation.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat's the matter now?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI say, you know!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very serious\\r\\nremonstrance. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPip, old chap! You'll do yourself a mischief. It'll stick\\r\\nsomewhere. You can't have chawed it, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat's the matter now?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated my sister, more sharply than before.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I'd recommend you to do it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Joe, all aghast. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cManners is manners, but still your elth's your\\r\\nelth.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,\\r\\nand, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little while\\r\\nagainst the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, looking guiltily\\r\\non.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, perhaps you'll mention what's the matter,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my sister, out of\\r\\nbreath, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou staring great stuck pig.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and\\r\\nlooked at me again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek,\\r\\nand speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cyou and me is always friends, and I'd be the last to tell upon you,\\r\\nany time. But such a--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he moved his chair and looked about the floor\\r\\nbetween us, and then again at me--Ã¢\\x80\\x9csuch a most oncommon Bolt as that!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBeen bolting his food, has he?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried my sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know, old chap,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe,\\r\\nwith his bite still in his cheek, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI Bolted, myself, when I was your\\r\\nage--frequent--and as a boy I've been among a many Bolters; but I never\\r\\nsee your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it's a mercy you ain't Bolted\\r\\ndead.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying\\r\\nnothing more than the awful words, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou come along and be dosed.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSome medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine\\r\\nmedicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;\\r\\nhaving a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the\\r\\nbest of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice\\r\\nrestorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like a new\\r\\nfence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a\\r\\npint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater\\r\\ncomfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would\\r\\nbe held in a bootjack. Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to\\r\\nswallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching and\\r\\nmeditating before the fire), Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbecause he had had a turn.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Judging from\\r\\nmyself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had had\\r\\nnone before.\\r\\n\\r\\nConscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in\\r\\nthe case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret\\r\\nburden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great\\r\\npunishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe--I\\r\\nnever thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the\\r\\nhousekeeping property as his--united to the necessity of always keeping\\r\\none hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about\\r\\nthe kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind. Then,\\r\\nas the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the\\r\\nvoice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to\\r\\nsecrecy, declaring that he couldn't and wouldn't starve until to-morrow,\\r\\nbut must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the young man\\r\\nwho was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me\\r\\nshould yield to a constitutional impatience, or should mistake the time,\\r\\nand should think himself accredited to my heart and liver to-night,\\r\\ninstead of to-morrow! If ever anybody's hair stood on end with terror,\\r\\nmine must have done so then. But, perhaps, nobody's ever did?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with\\r\\na copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with\\r\\nthe load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the\\r\\nload on HIS leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread\\r\\nand butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped away,\\r\\nand deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHark!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final warm\\r\\nin the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwas that great guns,\\r\\nJoe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere's another conwict off.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat does that mean, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEscaped. Escaped.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Administering the definition like Tar-water.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put my\\r\\nmouth into the forms of saying to Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat's a convict?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe put his\\r\\nmouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer, that I\\r\\ncould make out nothing of it but the single word Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere was a conwict off last night,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, aloud, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cafter\\r\\nsunset-gun. And they fired warning of him. And now it appears they're\\r\\nfiring warning of another.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWho's firing?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDrat that boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cwhat a questioner he is. Ask no questions, and you'll be told no lies.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should be\\r\\ntold lies by her even if I did ask questions. But she never was polite\\r\\nunless there was company.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost\\r\\npains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a word\\r\\nthat looked to me like Ã¢\\x80\\x9csulks.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Therefore, I naturally pointed to Mrs.\\r\\nJoe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cher?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d But Joe wouldn't\\r\\nhear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide, and shook\\r\\nthe form of a most emphatic word out of it. But I could make nothing of\\r\\nthe word.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMrs. Joe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, as a last resort, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should like to know--if you\\r\\nwouldn't much mind--where the firing comes from?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLord bless the boy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed my sister, as if she didn't quite mean\\r\\nthat but rather the contrary. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFrom the Hulks!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh-h!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, looking at Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHulks!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, I told you so.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd please, what's Hulks?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's the way with this boy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed my sister, pointing me out\\r\\nwith her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnswer him one\\r\\nquestion, and he'll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships,\\r\\nright 'cross th' meshes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d We always used that name for marshes, in our\\r\\ncountry.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wonder who's put into prison-ships, and why they're put there?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nI, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI tell you what,\\r\\nyoung fellow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI didn't bring you up by hand to badger\\r\\npeople's lives out. It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had.\\r\\nPeople are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob,\\r\\nand forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking\\r\\nquestions. Now, you get along to bed!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went upstairs\\r\\nin the dark, with my head tingling,--from Mrs. Joe's thimble\\r\\nhaving played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words,--I\\r\\nfelt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were\\r\\nhandy for me. I was clearly on my way there. I had begun by asking\\r\\nquestions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought\\r\\nthat few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror.\\r\\nNo matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror. I was in\\r\\nmortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was\\r\\nin mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal\\r\\nterror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had\\r\\nno hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed\\r\\nme at every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on\\r\\nrequirement, in the secrecy of my terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting\\r\\ndown the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly\\r\\npirate calling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the\\r\\ngibbet-station, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at\\r\\nonce, and not put it off. I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been\\r\\ninclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob\\r\\nthe pantry. There was no doing it in the night, for there was no getting\\r\\na light by easy friction then; to have got one I must have struck it out\\r\\nof flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very pirate himself\\r\\nrattling his chains.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot\\r\\nwith gray, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way, and\\r\\nevery crack in every board calling after me, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cStop thief!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGet up,\\r\\nMrs. Joe!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied than\\r\\nusual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare hanging\\r\\nup by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my back was half\\r\\nturned, winking. I had no time for verification, no time for selection,\\r\\nno time for anything, for I had no time to spare. I stole some bread,\\r\\nsome rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which I tied up in\\r\\nmy pocket-handkerchief with my last night's slice), some brandy from a\\r\\nstone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I had secretly used\\r\\nfor making that intoxicating fluid, Spanish-liquorice-water, up in my\\r\\nroom: diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard),\\r\\na meat bone with very little on it, and a beautiful round compact pork\\r\\npie. I was nearly going away without the pie, but I was tempted to mount\\r\\nupon a shelf, to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a\\r\\ncovered earthenware dish in a corner, and I found it was the pie, and\\r\\nI took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use, and would\\r\\nnot be missed for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I\\r\\nunlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe's tools.\\r\\nThen I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which\\r\\nI had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the misty\\r\\nmarshes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter III\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the\\r\\noutside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there all\\r\\nnight, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw the\\r\\ndamp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort of\\r\\nspiders' webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade. On\\r\\nevery rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so thick,\\r\\nthat the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village--a\\r\\ndirection which they never accepted, for they never came there--was\\r\\ninvisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as I looked up\\r\\nat it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a\\r\\nphantom devoting me to the Hulks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that\\r\\ninstead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me.\\r\\nThis was very disagreeable to a guilty mind. The gates and dikes and\\r\\nbanks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainly\\r\\nas could be, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA boy with somebody else's pork pie! Stop him!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The\\r\\ncattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes,\\r\\nand steaming out of their nostrils, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHalloa, young thief!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d One black\\r\\nox, with a white cravat on,--who even had to my awakened conscience\\r\\nsomething of a clerical air,--fixed me so obstinately with his eyes,\\r\\nand moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved\\r\\nround, that I blubbered out to him, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI couldn't help it, sir! It wasn't\\r\\nfor myself I took it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Upon which he put down his head, blew a cloud of\\r\\nsmoke out of his nose, and vanished with a kick-up of his hind-legs and\\r\\na flourish of his tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I\\r\\nwent, I couldn't warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted, as\\r\\nthe iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet. I knew\\r\\nmy way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there on a\\r\\nSunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me that when\\r\\nI was 'prentice to him, regularly bound, we would have such Larks there!\\r\\nHowever, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last too far to\\r\\nthe right, and consequently had to try back along the river-side, on the\\r\\nbank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide\\r\\nout. Making my way along here with all despatch, I had just crossed a\\r\\nditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and had just scrambled\\r\\nup the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man sitting before me.\\r\\nHis back was towards me, and he had his arms folded, and was nodding\\r\\nforward, heavy with sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast,\\r\\nin that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him on\\r\\nthe shoulder. He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but\\r\\nanother man!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet this man was dressed in coarse gray, too, and had a great iron\\r\\non his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything that\\r\\nthe other man was; except that he had not the same face, and had a flat\\r\\nbroad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on. All this I saw in a moment, for\\r\\nI had only a moment to see it in: he swore an oath at me, made a hit at\\r\\nme,--it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself\\r\\ndown, for it made him stumble,--and then he ran into the mist, stumbling\\r\\ntwice as he went, and I lost him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's the young man!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identified\\r\\nhim. I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I had\\r\\nknown where it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the right\\r\\nman,--hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never all\\r\\nnight left off hugging and limping,--waiting for me. He was awfully\\r\\ncold, to be sure. I half expected to see him drop down before my face\\r\\nand die of deadly cold. His eyes looked so awfully hungry too, that when\\r\\nI handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass, it occurred to\\r\\nme he would have tried to eat it, if he had not seen my bundle. He did\\r\\nnot turn me upside down this time to get at what I had, but left me\\r\\nright side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my pockets.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat's in the bottle, boy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBrandy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious\\r\\nmanner,--more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent\\r\\nhurry, than a man who was eating it,--but he left off to take some of\\r\\nthe liquor. He shivered all the while so violently, that it was quite\\r\\nas much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth,\\r\\nwithout biting it off.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think you have got the ague,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI'm much of your opinion, boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's bad about here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I told him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou've been lying out on the meshes,\\r\\nand they're dreadful aguish. Rheumatic too.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI'll eat my breakfast afore they're the death of me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'd do\\r\\nthat, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is\\r\\nover there, directly afterwards. I'll beat the shivers so far, I'll bet\\r\\nyou.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, all\\r\\nat once: staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round\\r\\nus, and often stopping--even stopping his jaws--to listen. Some real or\\r\\nfancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the\\r\\nmarsh, now gave him a start, and he said, suddenly,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou're not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, sir! No!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNor giv' no one the office to follow you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI believe you. You'd be but a fierce young hound\\r\\nindeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched\\r\\nwarmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint\\r\\nis!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock,\\r\\nand was going to strike. And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled down\\r\\nupon the pie, I made bold to say, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am glad you enjoy it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid you speak?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI said I was glad you enjoyed it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThankee, my boy. I do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food; and I now\\r\\nnoticed a decided similarity between the dog's way of eating, and the\\r\\nman's. The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog. He\\r\\nswallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast;\\r\\nand he looked sideways here and there while he ate, as if he thought\\r\\nthere was danger in every direction of somebody's coming to take the pie\\r\\naway. He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it, to appreciate\\r\\nit comfortably I thought, or to have anybody to dine with him, without\\r\\nmaking a chop with his jaws at the visitor. In all of which particulars\\r\\nhe was very like the dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am afraid you won't leave any of it for him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, timidly; after\\r\\na silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of making\\r\\nthe remark. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere's no more to be got where that came from.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d It was the\\r\\ncertainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLeave any for him? Who's him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my friend, stopping in his\\r\\ncrunching of pie-crust.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe young man. That you spoke of. That was hid with you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh ah!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned, with something like a gruff laugh. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHim? Yes, yes!\\r\\nHe don't want no wittles.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI thought he looked as if he did,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and\\r\\nthe greatest surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLooked? When?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cJust now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhere?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYonder,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, pointing; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cover there, where I found him nodding\\r\\nasleep, and thought it was you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think his\\r\\nfirst idea about cutting my throat had revived.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDressed like you, you know, only with a hat,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I explained, trembling;\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cand--andÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--I was very anxious to put this delicately--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand with--the\\r\\nsame reason for wanting to borrow a file. Didn't you hear the cannon\\r\\nlast night?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen there was firing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wonder you shouldn't have been sure of that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I returned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor\\r\\nwe heard it up at home, and that's farther away, and we were shut in\\r\\nbesides.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, see now!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhen a man's alone on these flats, with a\\r\\nlight head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he hears\\r\\nnothin' all night, but guns firing, and voices calling. Hears? He sees\\r\\nthe soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried\\r\\nafore, closing in round him. Hears his number called, hears himself\\r\\nchallenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders 'Make\\r\\nready! Present! Cover him steady, men!' and is laid hands on--and\\r\\nthere's nothin'! Why, if I see one pursuing party last night--coming up\\r\\nin order, Damn 'em, with their tramp, tramp--I see a hundred. And as to\\r\\nfiring! Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad\\r\\nday,--But this manÃ¢\\x80\\x9d; he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten my\\r\\nbeing there; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdid you notice anything in him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe had a badly bruised face,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, recalling what I hardly knew I\\r\\nknew.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the man, striking his left cheek mercilessly, with\\r\\nthe flat of his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, there!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhere is he?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He crammed what little food was left, into the breast of\\r\\nhis gray jacket. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShow me the way he went. I'll pull him down, like a\\r\\nbloodhound. Curse this iron on my sore leg! Give us hold of the file,\\r\\nboy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man,\\r\\nand he looked up at it for an instant. But he was down on the rank wet\\r\\ngrass, filing at his iron like a madman, and not minding me or minding\\r\\nhis own leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but which he\\r\\nhandled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file. I\\r\\nwas very much afraid of him again, now that he had worked himself into\\r\\nthis fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping away\\r\\nfrom home any longer. I told him I must go, but he took no notice, so\\r\\nI thought the best thing I could do was to slip off. The last I saw\\r\\nof him, his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his\\r\\nfetter, muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg. The last\\r\\nI heard of him, I stopped in the mist to listen, and the file was still\\r\\ngoing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter IV\\r\\n\\r\\nI fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me\\r\\nup. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet\\r\\nbeen made of the robbery. Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the\\r\\nhouse ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon\\r\\nthe kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,--an article into\\r\\nwhich his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister was\\r\\nvigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd where the deuce ha' you been?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d was Mrs. Joe's Christmas salutation,\\r\\nwhen I and my conscience showed ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nI said I had been down to hear the Carols. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAh! well!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d observed Mrs.\\r\\nJoe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou might ha' done worse.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Not a doubt of that I thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps if I warn't a blacksmith's wife, and (what's the same thing) a\\r\\nslave with her apron never off, I should have been to hear the Carols,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Mrs. Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'm rather partial to Carols, myself, and that's the\\r\\nbest of reasons for my never hearing any.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had\\r\\nretired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a\\r\\nconciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her eyes\\r\\nwere withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and exhibited them\\r\\nto me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper. This was so\\r\\nmuch her normal state, that Joe and I would often, for weeks together,\\r\\nbe, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to their legs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork and\\r\\ngreens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie had\\r\\nbeen made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not\\r\\nbeing missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive\\r\\narrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of\\r\\nbreakfast; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor I ain't,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Joe,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI ain't a going to have\\r\\nno formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I've got\\r\\nbefore me, I promise you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on a\\r\\nforced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of milk\\r\\nand water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the dresser. In\\r\\nthe meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and tacked a new\\r\\nflowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one, and\\r\\nuncovered the little state parlor across the passage, which was never\\r\\nuncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the year in a cool\\r\\nhaze of silver paper, which even extended to the four little white\\r\\ncrockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black nose and a\\r\\nbasket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of the other.\\r\\nMrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of\\r\\nmaking her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt\\r\\nitself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the same by\\r\\ntheir religion.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that\\r\\nis to say, Joe and I were going. In his working-clothes, Joe was a\\r\\nwell-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes,\\r\\nhe was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.\\r\\nNothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and\\r\\neverything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festive occasion\\r\\nhe emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going, the picture\\r\\nof misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me, I think my\\r\\nsister must have had some general idea that I was a young offender whom\\r\\nan Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) and delivered over\\r\\nto her, to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law.\\r\\nI was always treated as if I had insisted on being born in opposition\\r\\nto the dictates of reason, religion, and morality, and against the\\r\\ndissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I was taken to have\\r\\na new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of\\r\\nReformatory, and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle\\r\\nfor compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to\\r\\nwhat I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever\\r\\nMrs. Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be\\r\\nequalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had\\r\\ndone. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the\\r\\nChurch would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the\\r\\nterrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived the\\r\\nidea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYe are now to declare it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d would be the time for me to rise and propose\\r\\na private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure that I\\r\\nmight not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this\\r\\nextreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble\\r\\nthe wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe's uncle,\\r\\nbut Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in\\r\\nthe nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was\\r\\nhalf-past one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and\\r\\nMrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked\\r\\n(it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and\\r\\neverything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and\\r\\nthe company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large shining\\r\\nbald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of; indeed\\r\\nit was understood among his acquaintance that if you could only give him\\r\\nhis head, he would read the clergyman into fits; he himself confessed\\r\\nthat if the Church was Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthrown open,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d meaning to competition, he would\\r\\nnot despair of making his mark in it. The Church not being Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthrown\\r\\nopen,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he was, as I have said, our clerk. But he punished the Amens\\r\\ntremendously; and when he gave out the psalm,--always giving the whole\\r\\nverse,--he looked all round the congregation first, as much as to say,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your opinion of this\\r\\nstyle!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI opened the door to the company,--making believe that it was a habit\\r\\nof ours to open that door,--and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next\\r\\nto Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook. N.B. I was\\r\\nnot allowed to call him uncle, under the severest penalties.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMrs. Joe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged\\r\\nslow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair\\r\\nstanding upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just been\\r\\nall but choked, and had that moment come to, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have brought you as the\\r\\ncompliments of the season--I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry\\r\\nwine--and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty, with\\r\\nexactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.\\r\\nEvery Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cO, Un--cle\\r\\nPum-ble--chook! This is kind!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Every Christmas Day, he retorted, as\\r\\nhe now retorted, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt's no more than your merits. And now are you all\\r\\nbobbish, and how's Sixpennorth of halfpence?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d meaning me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts\\r\\nand oranges and apples to the parlor; which was a change very like\\r\\nJoe's change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress. My sister was\\r\\nuncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally more\\r\\ngracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I remember\\r\\nMrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue, who held a\\r\\nconventionally juvenile position, because she had married Mr. Hubble,--I\\r\\ndon't know at what remote period,--when she was much younger than he. I\\r\\nremember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered, stooping old man, of a\\r\\nsawdusty fragrance, with his legs extraordinarily wide apart: so that in\\r\\nmy short days I always saw some miles of open country between them when\\r\\nI met him coming up the lane.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn't\\r\\nrobbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in\\r\\nat an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and the\\r\\nPumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to speak\\r\\n(I didn't want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the scaly tips\\r\\nof the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure corners of pork\\r\\nof which the pig, when living, had had the least reason to be vain. No;\\r\\nI should not have minded that, if they would only have left me alone.\\r\\nBut they wouldn't leave me alone. They seemed to think the opportunity\\r\\nlost, if they failed to point the conversation at me, every now and\\r\\nthen, and stick the point into me. I might have been an unfortunate\\r\\nlittle bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched up by these\\r\\nmoral goads.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with\\r\\ntheatrical declamation,--as it now appears to me, something like a\\r\\nreligious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,--and\\r\\nended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.\\r\\nUpon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low\\r\\nreproachful voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo you hear that? Be grateful.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEspecially,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbe grateful, boy, to them which\\r\\nbrought you up by hand.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful\\r\\npresentiment that I should come to no good, asked, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy is it that the\\r\\nyoung are never grateful?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d This moral mystery seemed too much for\\r\\nthe company until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNaterally\\r\\nwicious.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Everybody then murmured Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTrue!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and looked at me in a\\r\\nparticularly unpleasant and personal manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe's station and influence were something feebler (if possible) when\\r\\nthere was company than when there was none. But he always aided and\\r\\ncomforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always did so\\r\\nat dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any. There being plenty\\r\\nof gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about half a\\r\\npint.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with\\r\\nsome severity, and intimated--in the usual hypothetical case of the\\r\\nChurch being Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthrown openÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--what kind of sermon he would have given\\r\\nthem. After favoring them with some heads of that discourse, he remarked\\r\\nthat he considered the subject of the day's homily, ill chosen; which\\r\\nwas the less excusable, he added, when there were so many subjects\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cgoing about.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTrue again,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Uncle Pumblechook. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou've hit it, sir! Plenty of\\r\\nsubjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their\\r\\ntails. That's what's wanted. A man needn't go far to find a subject,\\r\\nif he's ready with his salt-box.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short\\r\\ninterval of reflection, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLook at Pork alone. There's a subject! If you\\r\\nwant a subject, look at Pork!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTrue, sir. Many a moral for the young,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Wopsle,--and I\\r\\nknew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmight be deduced\\r\\nfrom that text.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n(Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou listen to this,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.)\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe gave me some more gravy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSwine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his fork\\r\\nat my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cswine were\\r\\nthe companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of Swine is put before us,\\r\\nas an example to the young.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (I thought this pretty well in him who\\r\\nhad been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.) Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is\\r\\ndetestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOr girl,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d suggested Mr. Hubble.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d assented Mr. Wopsle, rather irritably,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cbut there is no girl present.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBesides,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthink what you've\\r\\ngot to be grateful for. If you'd been born a Squeaker--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe was, if ever a child was,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my sister, most emphatically.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe gave me some more gravy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf you\\r\\nhad been born such, would you have been here now? Not you--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUnless in that form,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut I don't mean in that form, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had\\r\\nan objection to being interrupted; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI mean, enjoying himself with his\\r\\nelders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and\\r\\nrolling in the lap of luxury. Would he have been doing that? No, he\\r\\nwouldn't. And what would have been your destination?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d turning on me\\r\\nagain. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou would have been disposed of for so many shillings according\\r\\nto the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would have\\r\\ncome up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whipped you\\r\\nunder his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up his frock\\r\\nto get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would have\\r\\nshed your blood and had your life. No bringing up by hand then. Not a\\r\\nbit of it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe was a world of trouble to you, ma'am,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Hubble,\\r\\ncommiserating my sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTrouble?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d echoed my sister; Ã¢\\x80\\x9ctrouble?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and then entered on a fearful\\r\\ncatalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts\\r\\nof sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled\\r\\nfrom, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I\\r\\nhad done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and I\\r\\nhad contumaciously refused to go there.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with\\r\\ntheir noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in\\r\\nconsequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle's Roman nose so aggravated me, during\\r\\nthe recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it\\r\\nuntil he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in\\r\\ncomparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the\\r\\npause was broken which ensued upon my sister's recital, and in which\\r\\npause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) with\\r\\nindignation and abhorrence.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the\\r\\ntheme from which they had strayed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPork--regarded as biled--is rich,\\r\\ntoo; ain't it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave a little brandy, uncle,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nO Heavens, it had come at last! He would find it was weak, he would say\\r\\nit was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table under\\r\\nthe cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle,\\r\\nand poured his brandy out: no one else taking any. The wretched man\\r\\ntrifled with his glass,--took it up, looked at it through the light,\\r\\nput it down,--prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were\\r\\nbriskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.\\r\\n\\r\\nI couldn't keep my eyes off him. Always holding tight by the leg of the\\r\\ntable with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger his\\r\\nglass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink\\r\\nthe brandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with\\r\\nunspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning\\r\\nround several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance,\\r\\nand rushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window,\\r\\nviolently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces, and\\r\\napparently out of his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nI held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him. I didn't know how\\r\\nI had done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow. In my\\r\\ndreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, and\\r\\nsurveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him, sank\\r\\ndown into his chair with the one significant gasp, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTar!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew he would be\\r\\nworse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day, by\\r\\nthe vigor of my unseen hold upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTar!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried my sister, in amazement. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, how ever could Tar come\\r\\nthere?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn't\\r\\nhear the word, wouldn't hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all\\r\\naway with his hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who had\\r\\nbegun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in\\r\\ngetting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and mixing\\r\\nthem. For the time being at least, I was saved. I still held on to the\\r\\nleg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of\\r\\npudding. Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of pudding.\\r\\nThe course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the\\r\\ngenial influence of gin and water. I began to think I should get over\\r\\nthe day, when my sister said to Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cClean plates,--cold.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my\\r\\nbosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul.\\r\\nI foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou must taste,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my sister, addressing the guests with her best\\r\\ngrace--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious\\r\\npresent of Uncle Pumblechook's!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMust they! Let them not hope to taste it!\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou must know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my sister, rising, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit's a pie; a savory pork\\r\\npie.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of\\r\\nhaving deserved well of his fellow-creatures, said,--quite vivaciously,\\r\\nall things considered,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Mrs. Joe, we'll do our best endeavors;\\r\\nlet us have a cut at this same pie.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sister went out to get it. I heard her steps proceed to the pantry. I\\r\\nsaw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife. I saw reawakening appetite in the\\r\\nRoman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle. I heard Mr. Hubble remark that Ã¢\\x80\\x9ca bit of\\r\\nsavory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do\\r\\nno harm,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and I heard Joe say, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou shall have some, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I have never\\r\\nbeen absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror,\\r\\nmerely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company. I felt that I\\r\\ncould bear no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg of the\\r\\ntable, and ran for my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost\\r\\ninto a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a pair\\r\\nof handcuffs to me, saying, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHere you are, look sharp, come on!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter V\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but-ends of their\\r\\nloaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to rise\\r\\nfrom table in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the kitchen\\r\\nempty-handed, to stop short and stare, in her wondering lament of\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGracious goodness gracious me, what's gone--with the--pie!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring;\\r\\nat which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses. It was\\r\\nthe sergeant who had spoken to me, and he was now looking round at the\\r\\ncompany, with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his\\r\\nright hand, and his left on my shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, ladies and gentleman,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut as I have\\r\\nmentioned at the door to this smart young shaver,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (which he hadn't), Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nam on a chase in the name of the king, and I want the blacksmith.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd pray what might you want with him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d retorted my sister, quick to\\r\\nresent his being wanted at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMissis,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the gallant sergeant, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cspeaking for myself, I should\\r\\nreply, the honor and pleasure of his fine wife's acquaintance; speaking\\r\\nfor the king, I answer, a little job done.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr.\\r\\nPumblechook cried audibly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGood again!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou see, blacksmith,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant, who had by this time picked\\r\\nout Joe with his eye, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe have had an accident with these, and I find\\r\\nthe lock of one of 'em goes wrong, and the coupling don't act pretty.\\r\\nAs they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over\\r\\nthem?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe threw his eye over them, and pronounced that the job would\\r\\nnecessitate the lighting of his forge fire, and would take nearer\\r\\ntwo hours than one. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWill it? Then will you set about it at once,\\r\\nblacksmith?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the off-hand sergeant, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas it's on his Majesty's\\r\\nservice. And if my men can bear a hand anywhere, they'll make themselves\\r\\nuseful.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d With that, he called to his men, who came trooping into the\\r\\nkitchen one after another, and piled their arms in a corner. And then\\r\\nthey stood about, as soldiers do; now, with their hands loosely clasped\\r\\nbefore them; now, resting a knee or a shoulder; now, easing a belt or a\\r\\npouch; now, opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks, out\\r\\ninto the yard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I\\r\\nwas in an agony of apprehension. But beginning to perceive that the\\r\\nhandcuffs were not for me, and that the military had so far got the\\r\\nbetter of the pie as to put it in the background, I collected a little\\r\\nmore of my scattered wits.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWould you give me the time?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant, addressing himself to\\r\\nMr. Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the\\r\\ninference that he was equal to the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's just gone half past two.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's not so bad,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant, reflecting; Ã¢\\x80\\x9ceven if I was\\r\\nforced to halt here nigh two hours, that'll do. How far might you call\\r\\nyourselves from the marshes, hereabouts? Not above a mile, I reckon?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cJust a mile,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat'll do. We begin to close in upon 'em about dusk. A little before\\r\\ndusk, my orders are. That'll do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cConvicts, sergeant?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the sergeant, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ctwo. They're pretty well known to be out\\r\\non the marshes still, and they won't try to get clear of 'em before\\r\\ndusk. Anybody here seen anything of any such game?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence. Nobody thought of\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthey'll find themselves trapped in a circle,\\r\\nI expect, sooner than they count on. Now, blacksmith! If you're ready,\\r\\nhis Majesty the King is.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his leather apron\\r\\non, and passed into the forge. One of the soldiers opened its wooden\\r\\nwindows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at the bellows, the\\r\\nrest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring. Then Joe began to\\r\\nhammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general\\r\\nattention, but even made my sister liberal. She drew a pitcher of beer\\r\\nfrom the cask for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take a glass\\r\\nof brandy. But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGive him wine, Mum. I'll\\r\\nengage there's no tar in that:Ã¢\\x80\\x9d so, the sergeant thanked him and said\\r\\nthat as he preferred his drink without tar, he would take wine, if it\\r\\nwas equally convenient. When it was given him, he drank his Majesty's\\r\\nhealth and compliments of the season, and took it all at a mouthful and\\r\\nsmacked his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood stuff, eh, sergeant?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI'll tell you something,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the sergeant; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI suspect that\\r\\nstuff's of your providing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAy, ay? Why?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the sergeant, clapping him on the shoulder, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou're\\r\\na man that knows what's what.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cD'ye think so?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, with his former laugh. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHave\\r\\nanother glass!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWith you. Hob and nob,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the sergeant. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe top of mine to the\\r\\nfoot of yours,--the foot of yours to the top of mine,--Ring once, ring\\r\\ntwice,--the best tune on the Musical Glasses! Your health. May you live\\r\\na thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you\\r\\nare at the present moment of your life!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for\\r\\nanother glass. I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality\\r\\nappeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took the\\r\\nbottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a\\r\\ngush of joviality. Even I got some. And he was so very free of the wine\\r\\nthat he even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with the\\r\\nsame liberality, when the first was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge,\\r\\nenjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for\\r\\na dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was. They had not enjoyed\\r\\nthemselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened\\r\\nwith the excitement he furnished. And now, when they were all in lively\\r\\nanticipation of Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe two villainsÃ¢\\x80\\x9d being taken, and when the bellows\\r\\nseemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke\\r\\nto hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them,\\r\\nand all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the\\r\\nblaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale\\r\\nafternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned\\r\\npale on their account, poor wretches.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, Joe's job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. As Joe\\r\\ngot on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us should\\r\\ngo down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mr. Pumblechook\\r\\nand Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies' society; but\\r\\nMr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would. Joe said he was agreeable,\\r\\nand would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. We never should have got leave\\r\\nto go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe's curiosity to know all about it and\\r\\nhow it ended. As it was, she merely stipulated, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf you bring the boy\\r\\nback with his head blown to bits by a musket, don't look to me to put it\\r\\ntogether again.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr.\\r\\nPumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fully\\r\\nsensible of that gentleman's merits under arid conditions, as when\\r\\nsomething moist was going. His men resumed their muskets and fell in.\\r\\nMr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and\\r\\nto speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out in\\r\\nthe raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I treasonably\\r\\nwhispered to Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI hope, Joe, we shan't find them.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and Joe whispered\\r\\nto me, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'd give a shilling if they had cut and run, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was\\r\\ncold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming\\r\\non, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day. A\\r\\nfew faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came\\r\\nout. We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.\\r\\nThere we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant's\\r\\nhand, while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the\\r\\ngraves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without finding\\r\\nanything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate\\r\\nat the side of the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us\\r\\nhere on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little\\r\\nthought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men\\r\\nhiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should\\r\\ncome upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who\\r\\nhad brought the soldiers there? He had asked me if I was a deceiving\\r\\nimp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the\\r\\nhunt against him. Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in\\r\\ntreacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Joe's\\r\\nback, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a\\r\\nhunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and\\r\\nto keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a\\r\\npretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were taking\\r\\nthe course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.\\r\\nEither the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.\\r\\nUnder the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the\\r\\nmound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain,\\r\\nthough all of a watery lead color.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe's broad shoulder, I\\r\\nlooked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I could\\r\\nhear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by his\\r\\nblowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and\\r\\ncould dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful\\r\\nstart, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a\\r\\nsheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at\\r\\nus; and the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared\\r\\nangrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except\\r\\nthese things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,\\r\\nthere was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and we\\r\\nwere moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we all\\r\\nstopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a\\r\\nlong shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but\\r\\nit was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised\\r\\ntogether,--if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under\\r\\ntheir breath, when Joe and I came up. After another moment's listening,\\r\\nJoe (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who was a bad judge)\\r\\nagreed. The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not\\r\\nbe answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his men\\r\\nshould make towards it Ã¢\\x80\\x9cat the double.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d So we slanted to the right\\r\\n(where the East was), and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had to\\r\\nhold on tight to keep my seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words he\\r\\nspoke all the time, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ca Winder.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Down banks and up banks, and over gates,\\r\\nand splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: no man cared\\r\\nwhere he went. As we came nearer to the shouting, it became more and\\r\\nmore apparent that it was made by more than one voice. Sometimes, it\\r\\nseemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped. When it broke\\r\\nout again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever, and we\\r\\nafter them. After a while, we had so run it down, that we could hear one\\r\\nvoice calling Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMurder!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and another voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cConvicts! Runaways! Guard!\\r\\nThis way for the runaway convicts!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Then both voices would seem to be\\r\\nstifled in a struggle, and then would break out again. And when it had\\r\\ncome to this, the soldiers ran like deer, and Joe too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and two\\r\\nof his men ran in close upon him. Their pieces were cocked and levelled\\r\\nwhen we all ran in.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHere are both men!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a\\r\\nditch. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSurrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts! Come\\r\\nasunder!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWater was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn, and\\r\\nblows were being struck, when some more men went down into the ditch to\\r\\nhelp the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and the other\\r\\none. Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling; but\\r\\nof course I knew them both directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMind!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his ragged\\r\\nsleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI took him! I give him\\r\\nup to you! Mind that!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's not much to be particular about,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit'll do you\\r\\nsmall good, my man, being in the same plight yourself. Handcuffs there!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't expect it to do me any good. I don't want it to do me more good\\r\\nthan it does now,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my convict, with a greedy laugh. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI took him. He\\r\\nknows it. That's enough for me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old\\r\\nbruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.\\r\\nHe could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both\\r\\nseparately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from\\r\\nfalling.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTake notice, guard,--he tried to murder me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d were his first words.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTried to murder him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my convict, disdainfully. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTry, and not\\r\\ndo it? I took him, and giv' him up; that's what I done. I not only\\r\\nprevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here,--dragged\\r\\nhim this far on his way back. He's a gentleman, if you please, this\\r\\nvillain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murder\\r\\nhim? Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and drag\\r\\nhim back!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other one still gasped, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe tried--he tried-to--murder me.\\r\\nBear--bear witness.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLookee here!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my convict to the sergeant. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSingle-handed I got\\r\\nclear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. I could ha' got\\r\\nclear of these death-cold flats likewise--look at my leg: you won't find\\r\\nmuch iron on it--if I hadn't made the discovery that he was here. Let\\r\\nhim go free? Let him profit by the means as I found out? Let him make a\\r\\ntool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I had died at\\r\\nthe bottom there,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his\\r\\nmanacled hands, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'd have held to him with that grip, that you should\\r\\nhave been safe to find him in my hold.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of his\\r\\ncompanion, repeated, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe tried to murder me. I should have been a dead\\r\\nman if you had not come up.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe lies!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my convict, with fierce energy. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe's a liar born, and\\r\\nhe'll die a liar. Look at his face; ain't it written there? Let him turn\\r\\nthose eyes of his on me. I defy him to do it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other, with an effort at a scornful smile, which could not, however,\\r\\ncollect the nervous working of his mouth into any set expression, looked\\r\\nat the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes and at the sky, but\\r\\ncertainly did not look at the speaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you see him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pursued my convict. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo you see what a villain he is?\\r\\nDo you see those grovelling and wandering eyes? That's how he looked\\r\\nwhen we were tried together. He never looked at me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other, always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes\\r\\nrestlessly about him far and near, did at last turn them for a moment on\\r\\nthe speaker, with the words, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou are not much to look at,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and with\\r\\na half-taunting glance at the bound hands. At that point, my convict\\r\\nbecame so frantically exasperated, that he would have rushed upon him\\r\\nbut for the interposition of the soldiers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDidn't I tell you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nother convict then, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat he would murder me, if he could?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And any one\\r\\ncould see that he shook with fear, and that there broke out upon his\\r\\nlips curious white flakes, like thin snow.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEnough of this parley,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLight those torches.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went down\\r\\non his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the first time,\\r\\nand saw me. I had alighted from Joe's back on the brink of the ditch\\r\\nwhen we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at him eagerly when\\r\\nhe looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head. I had\\r\\nbeen waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of my\\r\\ninnocence. It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended\\r\\nmy intention, for he gave me a look that I did not understand, and it\\r\\nall passed in a moment. But if he had looked at me for an hour or for\\r\\na day, I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards, as having\\r\\nbeen more attentive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four\\r\\ntorches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had been\\r\\nalmost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards\\r\\nvery dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in\\r\\na ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torches kindled\\r\\nat some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the opposite\\r\\nbank of the river. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAll right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMarch.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a\\r\\nsound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou are expected\\r\\non board,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant to my convict; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthey know you are coming.\\r\\nDon't straggle, my man. Close up here.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate guard.\\r\\nI had hold of Joe's hand now, and Joe carried one of the torches. Mr.\\r\\nWopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to see it out, so\\r\\nwe went on with the party. There was a reasonably good path now, mostly\\r\\non the edge of the river, with a divergence here and there where a dike\\r\\ncame, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluice-gate. When\\r\\nI looked round, I could see the other lights coming in after us. The\\r\\ntorches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track, and\\r\\nI could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I could see nothing\\r\\nelse but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air about us with their\\r\\npitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that, as they\\r\\nlimped along in the midst of the muskets. We could not go fast, because\\r\\nof their lameness; and they were so spent, that two or three times we\\r\\nhad to halt while they rested.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut\\r\\nand a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged,\\r\\nand the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there was\\r\\na smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and\\r\\na stand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an\\r\\novergrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a dozen\\r\\nsoldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their\\r\\ngreat-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their heads\\r\\nand took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant made some\\r\\nkind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the convict whom I\\r\\ncall the other convict was drafted off with his guard, to go on board\\r\\nfirst.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy convict never looked at me, except that once. While we stood in the\\r\\nhut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up\\r\\nhis feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if\\r\\nhe pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, he turned to the\\r\\nsergeant, and remarked,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wish to say something respecting this escape. It may prevent some\\r\\npersons laying under suspicion alonger me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou can say what you like,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the sergeant, standing coolly\\r\\nlooking at him with his arms folded, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut you have no call to say it\\r\\nhere. You'll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about it,\\r\\nbefore it's done with, you know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A man can't\\r\\nstarve; at least I can't. I took some wittles, up at the willage over\\r\\nyonder,--where the church stands a'most out on the marshes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou mean stole,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd I'll tell you where from. From the blacksmith's.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHalloa!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the sergeant, staring at Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHalloa, Pip!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, staring at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt was some broken wittles--that's what it was--and a dram of liquor,\\r\\nand a pie.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked\\r\\nthe sergeant, confidentially.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy wife did, at the very moment when you came in. Don't you know, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and\\r\\nwithout the least glance at me,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cso you're the blacksmith, are you?\\r\\nThan I'm sorry to say, I've eat your pie.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGod knows you're welcome to it,--so far as it was ever mine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned\\r\\nJoe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe don't know what you have\\r\\ndone, but we wouldn't have you starved to death for it, poor miserable\\r\\nfellow-creatur.--Would us, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man's throat\\r\\nagain, and he turned his back. The boat had returned, and his guard were\\r\\nready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough stakes\\r\\nand stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by a crew of\\r\\nconvicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to see him, or interested\\r\\nin seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or spoke a word,\\r\\nexcept that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGive way,\\r\\nyou!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d which was the signal for the dip of the oars. By the light of the\\r\\ntorches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from the mud of\\r\\nthe shore, like a wicked Noah's ark. Cribbed and barred and moored by\\r\\nmassive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes to be\\r\\nironed like the prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and we saw\\r\\nhim taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches were\\r\\nflung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over with\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter VI\\r\\n\\r\\nMy state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so\\r\\nunexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure; but I hope\\r\\nit had some dregs of good at the bottom of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference\\r\\nto Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me. But\\r\\nI loved Joe,--perhaps for no better reason in those early days than\\r\\nbecause the dear fellow let me love him,--and, as to him, my inner self\\r\\nwas not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind (particularly when\\r\\nI first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joe the\\r\\nwhole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted that\\r\\nif I did, he would think me worse than I was. The fear of losing Joe's\\r\\nconfidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night\\r\\nstaring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up my\\r\\ntongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I never\\r\\nafterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker,\\r\\nwithout thinking that he was meditating on it. That, if Joe knew it, I\\r\\nnever afterwards could see him glance, however casually, at yesterday's\\r\\nmeat or pudding when it came on to-day's table, without thinking that he\\r\\nwas debating whether I had been in the pantry. That, if Joe knew it, and\\r\\nat any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his\\r\\nbeer was flat or thick, the conviction that he suspected tar in it,\\r\\nwould bring a rush of blood to my face. In a word, I was too cowardly\\r\\nto do what I knew to be right, as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing\\r\\nwhat I knew to be wrong. I had had no intercourse with the world at\\r\\nthat time, and I imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this\\r\\nmanner. Quite an untaught genius, I made the discovery of the line of\\r\\naction for myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe took\\r\\nme on his back again and carried me home. He must have had a tiresome\\r\\njourney of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad\\r\\ntemper that if the Church had been thrown open, he would probably have\\r\\nexcommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself. In\\r\\nhis lay capacity, he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such\\r\\nan insane extent, that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the\\r\\nkitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have\\r\\nhanged him, if it had been a capital offence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little\\r\\ndrunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and through having\\r\\nbeen fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of\\r\\ntongues. As I came to myself (with the aid of a heavy thump between the\\r\\nshoulders, and the restorative exclamation Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYah! Was there ever such\\r\\na boy as this!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d from my sister,) I found Joe telling them about the\\r\\nconvict's confession, and all the visitors suggesting different ways\\r\\nby which he had got into the pantry. Mr. Pumblechook made out, after\\r\\ncarefully surveying the premises, that he had first got upon the roof of\\r\\nthe forge, and had then got upon the roof of the house, and had then let\\r\\nhimself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut\\r\\ninto strips; and as Mr. Pumblechook was very positive and drove his\\r\\nown chaise-cart--over everybody--it was agreed that it must be so. Mr.\\r\\nWopsle, indeed, wildly cried out, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d with the feeble malice of a\\r\\ntired man; but, as he had no theory, and no coat on, he was unanimously\\r\\nset at naught,--not to mention his smoking hard behind, as he stood\\r\\nwith his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out: which was not\\r\\ncalculated to inspire confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as a\\r\\nslumberous offence to the company's eyesight, and assisted me up to bed\\r\\nwith such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to be\\r\\ndangling them all against the edges of the stairs. My state of mind, as\\r\\nI have described it, began before I was up in the morning, and lasted\\r\\nlong after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be mentioned\\r\\nsaving on exceptional occasions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter VII\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family\\r\\ntombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. My\\r\\nconstruction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I\\r\\nread Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwife of the AboveÃ¢\\x80\\x9d as a complimentary reference to my father's\\r\\nexaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relations\\r\\nhad been referred to as Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBelow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I have no doubt I should have formed\\r\\nthe worst opinions of that member of the family. Neither were my notions\\r\\nof the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, at\\r\\nall accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my\\r\\ndeclaration that I was to Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwalk in the same all the days of my life,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our\\r\\nhouse in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning down\\r\\nby the wheelwright's or up by the mill.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I could\\r\\nassume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPompeyed,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d or\\r\\n(as I render it) pampered. Therefore, I was not only odd-boy about the\\r\\nforge, but if any neighbor happened to want an extra boy to frighten\\r\\nbirds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I was favored with the\\r\\nemployment. In order, however, that our superior position might not be\\r\\ncompromised thereby, a money-box was kept on the kitchen mantel-shelf,\\r\\ninto which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were\\r\\ndropped. I have an impression that they were to be contributed\\r\\neventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt, but I know I\\r\\nhad no hope of any personal participation in the treasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wopsle's great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is\\r\\nto say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited\\r\\ninfirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in\\r\\nthe society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the improving\\r\\nopportunity of seeing her do it. She rented a small cottage, and Mr.\\r\\nWopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used to overhear him\\r\\nreading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and occasionally\\r\\nbumping on the ceiling. There was a fiction that Mr. Wopsle Ã¢\\x80\\x9cexaminedÃ¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n the scholars once a quarter. What he did on those occasions was to turn\\r\\nup his cuffs, stick up his hair, and give us Mark Antony's oration over\\r\\nthe body of Caesar. This was always followed by Collins's Ode on\\r\\nthe Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr. Wopsle as Revenge\\r\\nthrowing his blood-stained sword in thunder down, and taking the\\r\\nWar-denouncing trumpet with a withering look. It was not with me then,\\r\\nas it was in later life, when I fell into the society of the Passions,\\r\\nand compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the disadvantage of\\r\\nboth gentlemen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wopsle's great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution,\\r\\nkept in the same room--a little general shop. She had no idea what stock\\r\\nshe had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was a little\\r\\ngreasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a Catalogue\\r\\nof Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop transactions.\\r\\nBiddy was Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's granddaughter; I confess myself\\r\\nquite unequal to the working out of the problem, what relation she was\\r\\nto Mr. Wopsle. She was an orphan like myself; like me, too, had been\\r\\nbrought up by hand. She was most noticeable, I thought, in respect of\\r\\nher extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing, her hands always\\r\\nwanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at\\r\\nheel. This description must be received with a week-day limitation. On\\r\\nSundays, she went to church elaborated.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr.\\r\\nWopsle's great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been\\r\\na bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by every\\r\\nletter. After that I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, who\\r\\nseemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and\\r\\nbaffle recognition. But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to\\r\\nread, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending\\r\\ngreat efforts on the production of a letter to Joe. I think it must have\\r\\nbeen a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was a long\\r\\ntime after, and it was winter and a hard frost. With an alphabet on the\\r\\nhearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two to print\\r\\nand smear this epistle:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMI DEER JO i OPE U R KRWITE WELL i OPE i SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2 TEEDGE\\r\\nU JO AN THEN WE SHORL B SO GLODD AN WEN i M PRENGTD 2 U JO WOT LARX AN\\r\\nBLEVE ME INF XN PIP.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by\\r\\nletter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone. But I delivered\\r\\nthis written communication (slate and all) with my own hand, and Joe\\r\\nreceived it as a miracle of erudition.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI say, Pip, old chap!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat a\\r\\nscholar you are! An't you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should like to be,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, glancing at the slate as he held it; with\\r\\na misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, here's a J,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand a O equal to anythink! Here's a J and\\r\\na O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this\\r\\nmonosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I\\r\\naccidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit\\r\\nhis convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing to\\r\\nembrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I\\r\\nshould have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAh! But read the\\r\\nrest, Jo.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe rest, eh, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching eye,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOne, two, three. Why, here's three Js, and three Os, and three J-O,\\r\\nJoes in it, Pip!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him the whole\\r\\nletter.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAstonishing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, when I had finished. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou ARE a scholar.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow do you spell Gargery, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked him, with a modest patronage.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't spell it at all,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut supposing you did?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt can't be supposed,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTho' I'm uncommon fond of reading,\\r\\ntoo.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOn-common. Give me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ca good book, or a good newspaper, and\\r\\nsit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lord!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he continued,\\r\\nafter rubbing his knees a little, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhen you do come to a J and a O, and\\r\\nsays you, 'Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,' how interesting reading is!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI derived from this, that Joe's education, like Steam, was yet in its\\r\\ninfancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDidn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to\\r\\nhis usual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire\\r\\nbetween the lower bars; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'll tell you. My father, Pip, he were given\\r\\nto drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at\\r\\nmy mother, most onmerciful. It were a'most the only hammering he did,\\r\\nindeed, 'xcepting at myself. And he hammered at me with a wigor only\\r\\nto be equalled by the wigor with which he didn't hammer at his\\r\\nanwil.--You're a listening and understanding, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Joe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c'Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several\\r\\ntimes; and then my mother she'd go out to work, and she'd say, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cJoe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she'd say, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnow, please God, you shall have some schooling, child,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and\\r\\nshe'd put me to school. But my father were that good in his hart that\\r\\nhe couldn't abear to be without us. So, he'd come with a most tremenjous\\r\\ncrowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was, that\\r\\nthey used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us\\r\\nup to him. And then he took us home and hammered us. Which, you see,\\r\\nPip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the fire, and\\r\\nlooking at me, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwere a drawback on my learning.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCertainly, poor Joe!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThough mind you, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the\\r\\npoker on the top bar, Ã¢\\x80\\x9crendering unto all their doo, and maintaining\\r\\nequal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his hart,\\r\\ndon't you see?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn't see; but I didn't say so.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe pursued, Ã¢\\x80\\x9csomebody must keep the pot a biling, Pip, or the\\r\\npot won't bile, don't you know?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw that, and said so.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c'Consequence, my father didn't make objections to my going to work; so\\r\\nI went to work at my present calling, which were his too, if he\\r\\nwould have followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure you, Pip.\\r\\nIn time I were able to keep him, and I kep him till he went off in a\\r\\npurple leptic fit. And it were my intentions to have had put upon his\\r\\ntombstone that, Whatsume'er the failings on his part, Remember reader he\\r\\nwere that good in his heart.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful\\r\\nperspicuity, that I asked him if he had made it himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI made it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmy own self. I made it in a moment. It was like\\r\\nstriking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow. I never was so much\\r\\nsurprised in all my life,--couldn't credit my own ed,--to tell you the\\r\\ntruth, hardly believed it were my own ed. As I was saying, Pip, it were\\r\\nmy intentions to have had it cut over him; but poetry costs money, cut\\r\\nit how you will, small or large, and it were not done. Not to mention\\r\\nbearers, all the money that could be spared were wanted for my mother.\\r\\nShe were in poor elth, and quite broke. She weren't long of following,\\r\\npoor soul, and her share of peace come round at last.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe's blue eyes turned a little watery; he rubbed first one of them, and\\r\\nthen the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner, with the\\r\\nround knob on the top of the poker.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt were but lonesome then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cliving here alone, and I got\\r\\nacquainted with your sister. Now, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d--Joe looked firmly at me as\\r\\nif he knew I was not going to agree with him;--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyour sister is a fine\\r\\nfigure of a woman.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhatever family opinions, or whatever the world's opinions, on that\\r\\nsubject may be, Pip, your sister is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe tapped the top bar with the\\r\\npoker after every word following, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ca-fine-figure--of--a--woman!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI could think of nothing better to say than Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am glad you think so,\\r\\nJoe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo am I,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Joe, catching me up. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am glad I think so, Pip. A\\r\\nlittle redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what does it\\r\\nsignify to Me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI sagaciously observed, if it didn't signify to him, to whom did it\\r\\nsignify?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCertainly!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d assented Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThat's it. You're right, old chap! When I\\r\\ngot acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she was bringing\\r\\nyou up by hand. Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said,\\r\\nalong with all the folks. As to you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe pursued with a countenance\\r\\nexpressive of seeing something very nasty indeed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif you could have\\r\\nbeen aware how small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, you'd have\\r\\nformed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNot exactly relishing this, I said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNever mind me, Joe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut I did mind you, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned with tender simplicity. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhen\\r\\nI offered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in church at\\r\\nsuch times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said to\\r\\nher, 'And bring the poor little child. God bless the poor little child,'\\r\\nI said to your sister, 'there's room for him at the forge!'Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck:\\r\\nwho dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cEver the best of friends;\\r\\nan't us, Pip? Don't cry, old chap!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, you see, Pip, and here we are! That's about where it lights; here\\r\\nwe are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and I tell\\r\\nyou beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn't see\\r\\ntoo much of what we're up to. It must be done, as I may say, on the sly.\\r\\nAnd why on the sly? I'll tell you why, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he could have\\r\\nproceeded in his demonstration.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYour sister is given to government.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGiven to government, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea\\r\\n(and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her in a favor\\r\\nof the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGiven to government,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhich I meantersay the government of\\r\\nyou and myself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd she an't over partial to having scholars on the premises,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe\\r\\ncontinued, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand in partickler would not be over partial to my being a\\r\\nscholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, don't you see?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n when Joe stopped me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cStay a bit. I know what you're a going to say, Pip; stay a bit! I don't\\r\\ndeny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again. I don't\\r\\ndeny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do drop down upon us\\r\\nheavy. At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe\\r\\nsank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccandor compels fur\\r\\nto admit that she is a Buster.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital\\r\\nBs.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy don't I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Joe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, passing the poker in to his left hand, that he might\\r\\nfeel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that\\r\\nplacid occupation; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyour sister's a master-mind. A master-mind.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat's that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. But\\r\\nJoe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completely\\r\\nstopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHer.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd I ain't a master-mind,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look,\\r\\nand got back to his whisker. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd last of all, Pip,--and this I want to\\r\\nsay very serious to you, old chap,--I see so much in my poor mother,\\r\\nof a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never\\r\\ngetting no peace in her mortal days, that I'm dead afeerd of going wrong\\r\\nin the way of not doing what's right by a woman, and I'd fur rather\\r\\nof the two go wrong the t'other way, and be a little ill-conwenienced\\r\\nmyself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I wish there warn't\\r\\nno Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it all on myself;\\r\\nbut this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and I hope you'll\\r\\noverlook shortcomings.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from that\\r\\nnight. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but, afterwards\\r\\nat quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about him, I had\\r\\na new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up to Joe in my\\r\\nheart.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHowever,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; Ã¢\\x80\\x9chere's the\\r\\nDutch-clock a working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of 'em,\\r\\nand she's not come home yet! I hope Uncle Pumblechook's mare mayn't have\\r\\nset a forefoot on a piece o' ice, and gone down.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days,\\r\\nto assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a\\r\\nwoman's judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no\\r\\nconfidences in his domestic servant. This was market-day, and Mrs. Joe\\r\\nwas out on one of these expeditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to\\r\\nlisten for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew\\r\\nkeenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would die to-night of\\r\\nlying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at the stars, and\\r\\nconsidered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to them\\r\\nas he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering\\r\\nmultitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHere comes the mare,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cringing like a peal of bells!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as she\\r\\ncame along at a much brisker trot than usual. We got a chair out, ready\\r\\nfor Mrs. Joe's alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might see a\\r\\nbright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might\\r\\nbe out of its place. When we had completed these preparations, they\\r\\ndrove up, wrapped to the eyes. Mrs. Joe was soon landed, and Uncle\\r\\nPumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare with a cloth, and we\\r\\nwere soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold air in with us that\\r\\nit seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, and\\r\\nthrowing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cif this boy ain't grateful this night, he never will be!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was wholly\\r\\nuninformed why he ought to assume that expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's only to be hoped,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my sister, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat he won't be Pompeyed. But\\r\\nI have my fears.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe ain't in that line, Mum,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe knows better.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe? I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe looked at me, making the motion with his lips and eyebrows,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d My sister catching him in the act, he drew the back of his hand\\r\\nacross his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such occasions, and\\r\\nlooked at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my sister, in her snappish way. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat are you staring at?\\r\\nIs the house afire?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c--Which some individual,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe politely hinted, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmentioned--she.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd she is a she, I suppose?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my sister. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cUnless you call Miss\\r\\nHavisham a he. And I doubt if even you'll go so far as that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss Havisham, up town?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs there any Miss Havisham down town?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned my sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe wants this boy to go and play there. And of course he's going. And\\r\\nhe had better play there,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my sister, shaking her head at me as an\\r\\nencouragement to be extremely light and sportive, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cor I'll work him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had heard of Miss Havisham up town,--everybody for miles round had\\r\\nheard of Miss Havisham up town,--as an immensely rich and grim lady who\\r\\nlived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers, and who\\r\\nled a life of seclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell to be sure!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, astounded. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wonder how she come to know\\r\\nPip!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNoodle!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried my sister. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWho said she knew him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c--Which some individual,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe again politely hinted, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmentioned that\\r\\nshe wanted him to go and play there.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd couldn't she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and\\r\\nplay there? Isn't it just barely possible that Uncle Pumblechook may be\\r\\na tenant of hers, and that he may sometimes--we won't say quarterly\\r\\nor half-yearly, for that would be requiring too much of you--but\\r\\nsometimes--go there to pay his rent? And couldn't she then ask Uncle\\r\\nPumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there? And couldn't Uncle\\r\\nPumblechook, being always considerate and thoughtful for us--though you\\r\\nmay not think it, Joseph,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d in a tone of the deepest reproach, as if\\r\\nhe were the most callous of nephews, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthen mention this boy, standing\\r\\nPrancing hereÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--which I solemnly declare I was not doing--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat I have\\r\\nfor ever been a willing slave to?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood again!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Uncle Pumblechook. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell put! Prettily pointed! Good\\r\\nindeed! Now Joseph, you know the case.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, Joseph,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while Joe\\r\\napologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cyou do not yet--though you may not think it--know the case. You may\\r\\nconsider that you do, but you do not, Joseph. For you do not know that\\r\\nUncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell, this\\r\\nboy's fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havisham's, has offered\\r\\nto take him into town to-night in his own chaise-cart, and to keep\\r\\nhim to-night, and to take him with his own hands to Miss Havisham's\\r\\nto-morrow morning. And Lor-a-mussy me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried my sister, casting off her\\r\\nbonnet in sudden desperation, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chere I stand talking to mere Mooncalfs,\\r\\nwith Uncle Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catching cold at the door,\\r\\nand the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his head to the\\r\\nsole of his foot!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that, she pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my face was\\r\\nsqueezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put under taps of\\r\\nwater-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and towelled, and thumped,\\r\\nand harrowed, and rasped, until I really was quite beside myself. (I\\r\\nmay here remark that I suppose myself to be better acquainted than\\r\\nany living authority, with the ridgy effect of a wedding-ring, passing\\r\\nunsympathetically over the human countenance.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the\\r\\nstiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was\\r\\ntrussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then delivered\\r\\nover to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were the\\r\\nSheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been\\r\\ndying to make all along: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBoy, be forever grateful to all friends, but\\r\\nespecially unto them which brought you up by hand!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood-bye, Joe!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGod bless you, Pip, old chap!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings and what\\r\\nwith soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart.\\r\\nBut they twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on the\\r\\nquestions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham's, and what\\r\\non earth I was expected to play at.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter VIII\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pumblechook's premises in the High Street of the market town,\\r\\nwere of a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the premises of a\\r\\ncornchandler and seedsman should be. It appeared to me that he must be a\\r\\nvery happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop; and\\r\\nI wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and saw the\\r\\ntied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds and bulbs\\r\\never wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and bloom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this\\r\\nspeculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in\\r\\nan attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the\\r\\nbedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my\\r\\neyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity\\r\\nbetween seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did\\r\\nhis shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavor about the\\r\\ncorduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and flavor\\r\\nabout the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I hardly knew\\r\\nwhich was which. The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mr.\\r\\nPumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the\\r\\nstreet at the saddler, who appeared to transact his business by keeping\\r\\nhis eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to get on in life by putting his\\r\\nhands in his pockets and contemplating the baker, who in his turn folded\\r\\nhis arms and stared at the grocer, who stood at his door and yawned at\\r\\nthe chemist. The watchmaker, always poring over a little desk with\\r\\na magnifying-glass at his eye, and always inspected by a group of\\r\\nsmock-frocks poring over him through the glass of his shop-window,\\r\\nseemed to be about the only person in the High Street whose trade\\r\\nengaged his attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o'clock in the parlor behind\\r\\nthe shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread\\r\\nand butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered Mr.\\r\\nPumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my sister's\\r\\nidea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted\\r\\nto my diet,--besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination\\r\\nwith as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm water into\\r\\nmy milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out\\r\\naltogether,--his conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic. On\\r\\nmy politely bidding him Good morning, he said, pompously, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSeven times\\r\\nnine, boy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And how should I be able to answer, dodged in that way, in\\r\\na strange place, on an empty stomach! I was hungry, but before I had\\r\\nswallowed a morsel, he began a running sum that lasted all through the\\r\\nbreakfast. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSeven?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd four?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd eight?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd six?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd two?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd\\r\\nten?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And so on. And after each figure was disposed of, it was as much\\r\\nas I could do to get a bite or a sup, before the next came; while he sat\\r\\nat his ease guessing nothing, and eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I\\r\\nmay be allowed the expression) a gorging and gormandizing manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor such reasons, I was very glad when ten o'clock came and we started\\r\\nfor Miss Havisham's; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the\\r\\nmanner in which I should acquit myself under that lady's roof. Within\\r\\na quarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham's house, which was of old\\r\\nbrick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of the\\r\\nwindows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were\\r\\nrustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so\\r\\nwe had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come\\r\\nto open it. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr.\\r\\nPumblechook said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd fourteen?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but I pretended not to hear him), and\\r\\nsaw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewing\\r\\nwas going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nA window was raised, and a clear voice demanded Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat name?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d To which my\\r\\nconductor replied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPumblechook.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The voice returned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cQuite right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and\\r\\nthe window was shut again, and a young lady came across the court-yard,\\r\\nwith keys in her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is Pip, is it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the young lady, who was very pretty and\\r\\nseemed very proud; Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccome in, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDid you wish to see Miss Havisham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf Miss Havisham wished to see me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Pumblechook,\\r\\ndiscomfited.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the girl; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut you see she don't.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.\\r\\nPumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not\\r\\nprotest. But he eyed me severely,--as if I had done anything to\\r\\nhim!--and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBoy! Let\\r\\nyour behavior here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n I was not free from apprehension that he would come back to propound\\r\\nthrough the gate, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd sixteen?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d But he didn't.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard.\\r\\nIt was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice. The\\r\\nbrewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the\\r\\nwooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood\\r\\nopen, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.\\r\\nThe cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and\\r\\nit made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the\\r\\nbrewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe saw me looking at it, and she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou could drink without hurt\\r\\nall the strong beer that's brewed there now, boy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should think I could, miss,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, in a shy way.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBetter not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy;\\r\\ndon't you think so?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt looks like it, miss.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot that anybody means to try,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor that's all done with,\\r\\nand the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls. As to strong\\r\\nbeer, there's enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the Manor\\r\\nHouse.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs that the name of this house, miss?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOne of its names, boy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt has more than one, then, miss?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOne more. Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, or\\r\\nHebrew, or all three--or all one to me--for enough.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEnough House,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat's a curious name, miss.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut it meant more than it said. It meant, when it\\r\\nwas given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else. They\\r\\nmust have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think. But don't\\r\\nloiter, boy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThough she called me Ã¢\\x80\\x9cboyÃ¢\\x80\\x9d so often, and with a carelessness that was\\r\\nfar from complimentary, she was of about my own age. She seemed much\\r\\nolder than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful and self-possessed;\\r\\nand she was as scornful of me as if she had been one-and-twenty, and a\\r\\nqueen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two\\r\\nchains across it outside,--and the first thing I noticed was, that the\\r\\npassages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.\\r\\nShe took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase,\\r\\nand still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last we came to the door of a room, and she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGo in.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI answered, more in shyness than politeness, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAfter you, miss.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this she returned: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDon't be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And\\r\\nscornfully walked away, and--what was worse--took the candle with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the only\\r\\nthing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told\\r\\nfrom within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a pretty\\r\\nlarge room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of daylight was to\\r\\nbe seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed from the furniture,\\r\\nthough much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me. But\\r\\nprominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking-glass, and that\\r\\nI made out at first sight to be a fine lady's dressing-table.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no\\r\\nfine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an\\r\\nelbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the\\r\\nstrangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was dressed in rich materials,--satins, and lace, and silks,--all\\r\\nof white. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent\\r\\nfrom her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was\\r\\nwhite. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and\\r\\nsome other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid\\r\\nthan the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.\\r\\nShe had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,--the\\r\\nother was on the table near her hand,--her veil was but half arranged,\\r\\nher watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay\\r\\nwith those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and\\r\\nsome flowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the\\r\\nlooking-glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though\\r\\nI saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I\\r\\nsaw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been\\r\\nwhite long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw\\r\\nthat the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and\\r\\nlike the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her\\r\\nsunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure\\r\\nof a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had\\r\\nshrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly\\r\\nwaxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage\\r\\nlying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches\\r\\nto see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of\\r\\na vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to\\r\\nhave dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if\\r\\nI could.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWho is it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the lady at the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPip, ma'am.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Pumblechook's boy, ma'am. Come--to play.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCome nearer; let me look at you. Come close.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of\\r\\nthe surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped\\r\\nat twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at\\r\\ntwenty minutes to nine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLook at me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou are not afraid of a woman who has\\r\\nnever seen the sun since you were born?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie\\r\\ncomprehended in the answer Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you know what I touch here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, laying her hands, one upon\\r\\nthe other, on her left side.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, ma'am.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (It made me think of the young man.)\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do I touch?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYour heart.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBroken!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and\\r\\nwith a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards she kept\\r\\nher hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they\\r\\nwere heavy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am tired,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI want diversion, and I have done\\r\\nwith men and women. Play.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she\\r\\ncould hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide\\r\\nworld more difficult to be done under the circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI sometimes have sick fancies,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went on, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I have a sick fancy\\r\\nthat I want to see some play. There, there!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d with an impatient movement\\r\\nof the fingers of her right hand; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cplay, play, play!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment, with the fear of my sister's working me before my eyes, I\\r\\nhad a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character\\r\\nof Mr. Pumblechook's chaise-cart. But I felt myself so unequal to the\\r\\nperformance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss Havisham in\\r\\nwhat I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as she said, when\\r\\nwe had taken a good look at each other,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you sullen and obstinate?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, ma'am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can't play just\\r\\nnow. If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so\\r\\nI would do it if I could; but it's so new here, and so strange, and so\\r\\nfine,--and melancholy--.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or\\r\\nhad already said it, and we took another look at each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked at the\\r\\ndress she wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself in the\\r\\nlooking-glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo new to him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she muttered, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cso old to me; so strange to him, so\\r\\nfamiliar to me; so melancholy to both of us! Call Estella.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she was\\r\\nstill talking to herself, and kept quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCall Estella,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she repeated, flashing a look at me. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou can do that.\\r\\nCall Estella. At the door.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTo stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house,\\r\\nbawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive,\\r\\nand feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name, was almost\\r\\nas bad as playing to order. But she answered at last, and her light came\\r\\nalong the dark passage like a star.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from the\\r\\ntable, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her\\r\\npretty brown hair. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYour own, one day, my dear, and you will use it\\r\\nwell. Let me see you play cards with this boy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWith this boy? Why, he is a common laboring boy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,--only it seemed so\\r\\nunlikely,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell? You can break his heart.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you play, boy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Estella of myself, with the greatest\\r\\ndisdain.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNothing but beggar my neighbor, miss.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBeggar him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we sat down to cards.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was then I began to understand that everything in the room had\\r\\nstopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that\\r\\nMiss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had\\r\\ntaken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the dressing-table\\r\\nagain, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now yellow, had never\\r\\nbeen worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent,\\r\\nand saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now yellow, had been\\r\\ntrodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything, this standing still\\r\\nof all the pale decayed objects, not even the withered bridal dress on\\r\\nthe collapsed form could have looked so like grave-clothes, or the long\\r\\nveil so like a shroud.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and\\r\\ntrimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew nothing\\r\\nthen of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in\\r\\nancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly\\r\\nseen; but, I have often thought since, that she must have looked as if\\r\\nthe admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella with disdain, before\\r\\nour first game was out. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd what coarse hands he has! And what thick\\r\\nboots!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began\\r\\nto consider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so\\r\\nstrong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural, when I\\r\\nknew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me for\\r\\na stupid, clumsy laboring-boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou say nothing of her,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she looked\\r\\non. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her. What\\r\\ndo you think of her?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't like to say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTell me in my ear,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham, bending down.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think she is very proud,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I replied, in a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnything else?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think she is very pretty.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnything else?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think she is very insulting.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (She was looking at me then with a look\\r\\nof supreme aversion.)\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnything else?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think I should like to go home.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd never see her again, though she is so pretty?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am not sure that I shouldn't like to see her again, but I should like\\r\\nto go home now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou shall go soon,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham, aloud. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPlay the game out.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSaving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost\\r\\nsure that Miss Havisham's face could not smile. It had dropped into a\\r\\nwatchful and brooding expression,--most likely when all the things about\\r\\nher had become transfixed,--and it looked as if nothing could ever lift\\r\\nit up again. Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and her voice\\r\\nhad dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her;\\r\\naltogether, she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul,\\r\\nwithin and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.\\r\\n\\r\\nI played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me. She\\r\\nthrew the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as if she\\r\\ndespised them for having been won of me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen shall I have you here again?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet me think.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was beginning to remind her that to-day was Wednesday, when she\\r\\nchecked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her\\r\\nright hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere, there! I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing of\\r\\nweeks of the year. Come again after six days. You hear?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, ma'am.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEstella, take him down. Let him have something to eat, and let him roam\\r\\nand look about him while he eats. Go, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and she\\r\\nstood it in the place where we had found it. Until she opened the\\r\\nside entrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must\\r\\nnecessarily be night-time. The rush of the daylight quite confounded me,\\r\\nand made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange room\\r\\nmany hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are to wait here, you boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella; and disappeared and\\r\\nclosed the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my\\r\\ncoarse hands and my common boots. My opinion of those accessories was\\r\\nnot favorable. They had never troubled me before, but they troubled\\r\\nme now, as vulgar appendages. I determined to ask Joe why he had ever\\r\\ntaught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be called\\r\\nknaves. I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and then\\r\\nI should have been so too.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. She\\r\\nput the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread\\r\\nand meat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in\\r\\ndisgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,--I\\r\\ncannot hit upon the right name for the smart--God knows what its name\\r\\nwas,--that tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, the\\r\\ngirl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them.\\r\\nThis gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, she gave a\\r\\ncontemptuous toss--but with a sense, I thought, of having made too sure\\r\\nthat I was so wounded--and left me.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face\\r\\nin, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my\\r\\nsleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.\\r\\nAs I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so\\r\\nbitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name, that\\r\\nneeded counteraction.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sister's bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world in\\r\\nwhich children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is\\r\\nnothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may be\\r\\nonly small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child\\r\\nis small, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as many\\r\\nhands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter. Within\\r\\nmyself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with\\r\\ninjustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my\\r\\nsister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I had\\r\\ncherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave her\\r\\nno right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments, disgraces,\\r\\nfasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had nursed\\r\\nthis assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in a solitary and\\r\\nunprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was morally timid\\r\\nand very sensitive.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the\\r\\nbrewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my\\r\\nface with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate. The bread and meat\\r\\nwere acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon\\r\\nin spirits to look about me.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the\\r\\nbrewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high\\r\\nwind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there\\r\\nhad been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no pigeons\\r\\nin the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty, no malt in\\r\\nthe storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat.\\r\\nAll the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its\\r\\nlast reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was a wilderness of empty casks,\\r\\nwhich had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about\\r\\nthem; but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that\\r\\nwas gone,--and in this respect I remember those recluses as being like\\r\\nmost others.\\r\\n\\r\\nBehind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old\\r\\nwall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough\\r\\nto look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the\\r\\nhouse, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was\\r\\na track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes walked\\r\\nthere, and that Estella was walking away from me even then. But she\\r\\nseemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation presented\\r\\nby the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw her walking on them at\\r\\nthe end of the yard of casks. She had her back towards me, and held her\\r\\npretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never looked round,\\r\\nand passed out of my view directly. So, in the brewery itself,--by which\\r\\nI mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer,\\r\\nand where the brewing utensils still were. When I first went into it,\\r\\nand, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the door looking about\\r\\nme, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, and ascend some light\\r\\niron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead, as if she were going\\r\\nout into the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened\\r\\nto my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a\\r\\nstranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes--a little dimmed by\\r\\nlooking up at the frosty light--towards a great wooden beam in a low\\r\\nnook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure\\r\\nhanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but\\r\\none shoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded\\r\\ntrimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was\\r\\nMiss Havisham's, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if\\r\\nshe were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure,\\r\\nand in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment\\r\\nbefore, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror\\r\\nwas greatest of all when I found no figure there.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of\\r\\npeople passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving\\r\\ninfluence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have brought\\r\\nme round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself as soon\\r\\nas I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to let\\r\\nme out. She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I\\r\\nthought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced that\\r\\nmy hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened the\\r\\ngate, and stood holding it. I was passing out without looking at her,\\r\\nwhen she touched me with a taunting hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy don't you cry?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause I don't want to.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou have been crying till you are half blind, and\\r\\nyou are near crying again now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.\\r\\nI went straight to Mr. Pumblechook's, and was immensely relieved to find\\r\\nhim not at home. So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I was\\r\\nwanted at Miss Havisham's again, I set off on the four-mile walk to\\r\\nour forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply\\r\\nrevolving that I was a common laboring-boy; that my hands were coarse;\\r\\nthat my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit\\r\\nof calling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I had\\r\\nconsidered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-lived\\r\\nbad way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter IX\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about Miss\\r\\nHavisham's, and asked a number of questions. And I soon found myself\\r\\ngetting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small\\r\\nof the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen\\r\\nwall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficient length.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other\\r\\nyoung people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden\\r\\nin mine,--which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason\\r\\nto suspect myself of having been a monstrosity,--it is the key to many\\r\\nreservations. I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham's as my\\r\\neyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only that, but I felt\\r\\nconvinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and although\\r\\nshe was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an impression\\r\\nthat there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging\\r\\nher as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) before the\\r\\ncontemplation of Mrs. Joe. Consequently, I said as little as I could,\\r\\nand had my face shoved against the kitchen wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon by\\r\\na devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, came\\r\\ngaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the details divulged\\r\\nto him. And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyes and mouth\\r\\nopen, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoat heaving\\r\\nwith windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in the\\r\\nchair of honor by the fire. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow did you get on up town?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI answered, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPretty well, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and my sister shook her fist at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPretty well?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Pumblechook repeated. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPretty well is no answer. Tell\\r\\nus what you mean by pretty well, boy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy\\r\\nperhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, my\\r\\nobstinacy was adamantine. I reflected for some time, and then answered\\r\\nas if I had discovered a new idea, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI mean pretty well.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,--I\\r\\nhad no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,--when Mr.\\r\\nPumblechook interposed with Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo! Don't lose your temper. Leave this\\r\\nlad to me, ma'am; leave this lad to me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Pumblechook then turned me\\r\\ntowards him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFirst (to get our thoughts in order): Forty-three pence?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI calculated the consequences of replying Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFour Hundred Pound,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and\\r\\nfinding them against me, went as near the answer as I could--which was\\r\\nsomewhere about eightpence off. Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my\\r\\npence-table from Ã¢\\x80\\x9ctwelve pence make one shilling,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d up to Ã¢\\x80\\x9cforty pence\\r\\nmake three and fourpence,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had\\r\\ndone for me, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow! How much is forty-three pence?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d To which I replied,\\r\\nafter a long interval of reflection, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And I was so\\r\\naggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me,\\r\\nand said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIs forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for\\r\\ninstance?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was\\r\\nhighly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, and\\r\\nbrought him to a dead stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBoy! What like is Miss Havisham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Pumblechook began again when\\r\\nhe had recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the\\r\\nscrew.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery tall and dark,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I told him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs she, uncle?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked my sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that he had\\r\\nnever seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly. (Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThis is the way to have him!\\r\\nWe are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d)\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am sure, uncle,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Mrs. Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wish you had him always; you\\r\\nknow so well how to deal with him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, boy! What was she a doing of, when you went in today?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Mr.\\r\\nPumblechook.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe was sitting,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I answered, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cin a black velvet coach.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another--as they well\\r\\nmight--and both repeated, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIn a black velvet coach?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd Miss Estella--that's her niece, I think--handed her\\r\\nin cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate. And we all had\\r\\ncake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat mine,\\r\\nbecause she told me to.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWas anybody else there?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Mr. Pumblechook.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFour dogs,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLarge or small?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cImmense,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver\\r\\nbasket.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter\\r\\namazement. I was perfectly frantic,--a reckless witness under the\\r\\ntorture,--and would have told them anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhere was this coach, in the name of gracious?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked my sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn Miss Havisham's room.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d They stared again. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut there weren't any\\r\\nhorses to it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting\\r\\nfour richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of\\r\\nharnessing.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCan this be possible, uncle?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Mrs. Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat can the boy mean?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI'll tell you, Mum,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMy opinion is, it's a\\r\\nsedan-chair. She's flighty, you know,--very flighty,--quite flighty\\r\\nenough to pass her days in a sedan-chair.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid you ever see her in it, uncle?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Mrs. Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow could I,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned, forced to the admission, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhen I never see\\r\\nher in my life? Never clapped eyes upon her!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGoodness, uncle! And yet you have spoken to her?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, don't you know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat when I have\\r\\nbeen there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and the door\\r\\nhas stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way. Don't say you don't\\r\\nknow that, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there to play. What did you play\\r\\nat, boy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe played with flags,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I said. (I beg to observe that I think of myself\\r\\nwith amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFlags!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d echoed my sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cEstella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and\\r\\nMiss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out\\r\\nat the coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSwords!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated my sister. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhere did you get swords from?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOut of a cupboard,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd I saw pistols in it,--and jam,--and\\r\\npills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up\\r\\nwith candles.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's true, Mum,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThat's the\\r\\nstate of the case, for that much I've seen myself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And then they\\r\\nboth stared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my\\r\\ncountenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers\\r\\nwith my right hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have\\r\\nbetrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that\\r\\nthere was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement\\r\\nbut for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear\\r\\nin the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the\\r\\nmarvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I escaped.\\r\\nThe subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to have a cup\\r\\nof tea. To whom my sister, more for the relief of her own mind than for\\r\\nthe gratification of his, related my pretended experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the\\r\\nkitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only as\\r\\nregarded him,--not in the least as regarded the other two. Towards\\r\\nJoe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat\\r\\ndebating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham's acquaintance\\r\\nand favor. They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdo somethingÃ¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n for me; their doubts related to the form that something would take.\\r\\nMy sister stood out for Ã¢\\x80\\x9cproperty.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Pumblechook was in favor of a\\r\\nhandsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel trade,--say,\\r\\nthe corn and seed trade, for instance. Joe fell into the deepest\\r\\ndisgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I might only\\r\\nbe presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the veal-cutlets.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf a fool's head can't express better opinions than that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my\\r\\nsister, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand you have got any work to do, you had better go and do it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n So he went.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washing up,\\r\\nI stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him until he had done for\\r\\nthe night. Then I said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBefore the fire goes out, Joe, I should like to\\r\\ntell you something.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShould you, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen tell us. What is it, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cJoe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting\\r\\nit between my finger and thumb, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou remember all that about Miss\\r\\nHavisham's?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRemember?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI believe you! Wonderful!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's a terrible thing, Joe; it ain't true.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat are you telling of, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Joe, falling back in the greatest\\r\\namazement. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou don't mean to say it's--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes I do; it's lies, Joe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut not all of it? Why sure you don't mean to say, Pip, that there was\\r\\nno black welwet co--eh?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d For, I stood shaking my head. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut at least\\r\\nthere was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, persuasively, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif there\\r\\nwarn't no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, Joe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA dog?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA puppy? Come?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPip, old chap! This won't do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expect to\\r\\ngo to?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's terrible, Joe; ain't it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTerrible?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAwful! What possessed you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't know what possessed me, Joe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I replied, letting his shirt\\r\\nsleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head;\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cbut I wish you hadn't taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I\\r\\nwish my boots weren't so thick nor my hands so coarse.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn't been\\r\\nable to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to\\r\\nme, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's\\r\\nwho was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that I\\r\\nknew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the lies\\r\\nhad come of it somehow, though I didn't know how.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal\\r\\nwith as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of\\r\\nmetaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere's one thing you may be sure of, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, after some\\r\\nrumination, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnamely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didn't\\r\\nought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to\\r\\nthe same. Don't you tell no more of 'em, Pip. That ain't the way to get\\r\\nout of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I don't make\\r\\nit out at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. You're oncommon\\r\\nsmall. Likewise you're a oncommon scholar.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I've\\r\\nseen letters--Ah! and from gentlefolks!--that I'll swear weren't wrote\\r\\nin print,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. It's only\\r\\nthat.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbe it so or be it son't, you must be a common\\r\\nscholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The king upon\\r\\nhis throne, with his crown upon his ed, can't sit and write his acts\\r\\nof Parliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromoted\\r\\nPrince, with the alphabet.--Ah!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d added Joe, with a shake of the head\\r\\nthat was full of meaning, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand begun at A too, and worked his way to Z.\\r\\nAnd I know what that is to do, though I can't say I've exactly done it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhether common ones as to callings and earnings,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pursued Joe,\\r\\nreflectively, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmightn't be the better of continuing for to keep\\r\\ncompany with common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon\\r\\nones,--which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, Joe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c(I'm sorry there weren't a flag, Pip). Whether that might be or\\r\\nmightn't be, is a thing as can't be looked into now, without putting\\r\\nyour sister on the Rampage; and that's a thing not to be thought of as\\r\\nbeing done intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a\\r\\ntrue friend. Which this to you the true friend say. If you can't get to\\r\\nbe oncommon through going straight, you'll never get to do it through\\r\\ngoing crooked. So don't tell no more on 'em, Pip, and live well and die\\r\\nhappy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are not angry with me, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, old chap. But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay\\r\\nof a stunning and outdacious sort,--alluding to them which bordered on\\r\\nweal-cutlets and dog-fighting,--a sincere well-wisher would adwise, Pip,\\r\\ntheir being dropped into your meditations, when you go upstairs to bed.\\r\\nThat's all, old chap, and don't never do it no more.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forget\\r\\nJoe's recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and\\r\\nunthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me down, how common\\r\\nEstella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith; how thick his boots, and\\r\\nhow coarse his hands. I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting\\r\\nin the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and how\\r\\nMiss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far above the\\r\\nlevel of such common doings. I fell asleep recalling what I Ã¢\\x80\\x9cused to\\r\\ndoÃ¢\\x80\\x9d when I was at Miss Havisham's; as though I had been there weeks or\\r\\nmonths, instead of hours; and as though it were quite an old subject of\\r\\nremembrance, instead of one that had arisen only that day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it\\r\\nis the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it,\\r\\nand think how different its course would have been. Pause you who read\\r\\nthis, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold,\\r\\nof thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the\\r\\nformation of the first link on one memorable day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter X\\r\\n\\r\\nThe felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke,\\r\\nthat the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to\\r\\nget out of Biddy everything she knew. In pursuance of this luminous\\r\\nconception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's\\r\\nat night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life,\\r\\nand that I should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart\\r\\nall her learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging of girls,\\r\\nimmediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her promise\\r\\nwithin five minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt\\r\\nmay be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples\\r\\nand put straws down one another's backs, until Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt\\r\\ncollected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with\\r\\na birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision, the\\r\\npupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to\\r\\nhand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and\\r\\na little spelling,--that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this\\r\\nvolume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt fell into a state of\\r\\ncoma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils then\\r\\nentered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject\\r\\nof Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon\\r\\nwhose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a rush at\\r\\nthem and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they had been\\r\\nunskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more illegibly printed\\r\\nat the best than any curiosities of literature I have since met with,\\r\\nspeckled all over with ironmould, and having various specimens of the\\r\\ninsect world smashed between their leaves. This part of the Course was\\r\\nusually lightened by several single combats between Biddy and refractory\\r\\nstudents. When the fights were over, Biddy gave out the number of a\\r\\npage, and then we all read aloud what we could,--or what we couldn't--in\\r\\na frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high, shrill, monotonous voice,\\r\\nand none of us having the least notion of, or reverence for, what we\\r\\nwere reading about. When this horrible din had lasted a certain time,\\r\\nit mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, who staggered at a boy\\r\\nfortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was understood to terminate\\r\\nthe Course for the evening, and we emerged into the air with shrieks of\\r\\nintellectual victory. It is fair to remark that there was no prohibition\\r\\nagainst any pupil's entertaining himself with a slate or even with the\\r\\nink (when there was any), but that it was not easy to pursue that branch\\r\\nof study in the winter season, on account of the little general shop\\r\\nin which the classes were holden--and which was also Mr. Wopsle's\\r\\ngreat-aunt's sitting-room and bedchamber--being but faintly illuminated\\r\\nthrough the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle and no snuffers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under\\r\\nthese circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that\\r\\nvery evening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some\\r\\ninformation from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head of moist\\r\\nsugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D which she\\r\\nhad imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which I supposed,\\r\\nuntil she told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe\\r\\nliked sometimes to smoke his pipe there. I had received strict orders\\r\\nfrom my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that\\r\\nevening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my peril. To the\\r\\nThree Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk\\r\\nscores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to\\r\\nbe never paid off. They had been there ever since I could remember, and\\r\\nhad grown more than I had. But there was a quantity of chalk about our\\r\\ncountry, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it\\r\\nto account.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly\\r\\nat these records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him, I\\r\\nmerely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at the\\r\\nend of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire,\\r\\nand where Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a\\r\\nstranger. Joe greeted me as usual with Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHalloa, Pip, old chap!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and the\\r\\nmoment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His head was\\r\\nall on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were\\r\\ntaking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his\\r\\nmouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away\\r\\nand looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he\\r\\nnodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit\\r\\ndown there.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of\\r\\nresort, I said Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo, thank you, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and fell into the space Joe made\\r\\nfor me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,\\r\\nand seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again\\r\\nwhen I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg--in a very odd way, as\\r\\nit struck me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou was saying,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the strange man, turning to Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat you was a\\r\\nblacksmith.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. I said it, you know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat'll you drink, Mr.--? You didn't mention your name, by the bye.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat'll you\\r\\ndrink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto tell you the truth, I ain't much in the habit of\\r\\ndrinking at anybody's expense but my own.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHabit? No,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the stranger, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut once and away, and on a\\r\\nSaturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wouldn't wish to be stiff company,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cRum.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRum,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated the stranger. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd will the other gentleman originate a\\r\\nsentiment.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRum,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wopsle.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThree Rums!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGlasses\\r\\nround!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis other gentleman,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cis a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at\\r\\nchurch.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAha!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe\\r\\nlonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put\\r\\nhis legs up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flapping\\r\\nbroad-brimmed traveller's hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over his\\r\\nhead in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair. As he looked\\r\\nat the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a\\r\\nhalf-laugh, come into his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a\\r\\nsolitary country towards the river.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMost marshes is solitary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or\\r\\nvagrants of any sort, out there?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnone but a runaway convict now and then. And we don't\\r\\nfind them, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented;\\r\\nbut not warmly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSeems you have been out after such?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked the stranger.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOnce,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot that we wanted to take them, you understand;\\r\\nwe went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn't us, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Joe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stranger looked at me again,--still cocking his eye, as if he were\\r\\nexpressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,--and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe's a\\r\\nlikely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cChristened Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, not christened Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSurname Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit's a kind of family name what he gave himself when a\\r\\ninfant, and is called by.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSon of yours?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in\\r\\nanywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at\\r\\nthe Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was\\r\\ndiscussed over pipes,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwell--no. No, he ain't.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNevvy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the strange man.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, Ã¢\\x80\\x9che\\r\\nis not--no, not to deceive you, he is not--my nevvy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat the Blue Blazes is he?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked the stranger. Which appeared to me\\r\\nto be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about relationships,\\r\\nhaving professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man\\r\\nmight not marry; and expounded the ties between me and Joe. Having\\r\\nhis hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling\\r\\npassage from Richard the Third, and seemed to think he had done quite\\r\\nenough to account for it when he added, Ã¢\\x80\\x9c--as the poet says.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he considered\\r\\nit a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into\\r\\nmy eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing who visited\\r\\nat our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory\\r\\nprocess under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to mind that I\\r\\nwas ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family\\r\\ncircle, but some large-handed person took some such ophthalmic steps to\\r\\npatronize me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at\\r\\nme as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me\\r\\ndown. But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation,\\r\\nuntil the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he made his\\r\\nshot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was\\r\\npointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly at me,\\r\\nand he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me. And he stirred it and\\r\\nhe tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but with a file.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it\\r\\nhe wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be\\r\\nJoe's file, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the\\r\\ninstrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now reclined on his\\r\\nsettle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally about\\r\\nturnips.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause\\r\\nbefore going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights, which\\r\\nstimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on Saturdays\\r\\nthan at other times. The half-hour and the rum and water running out\\r\\ntogether, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cStop half a moment, Mr. Gargery,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the strange man. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think I've\\r\\ngot a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the boy\\r\\nshall have it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some\\r\\ncrumpled paper, and gave it to me. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYours!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMind! Your own.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners,\\r\\nand holding tight to Joe. He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr. Wopsle\\r\\ngood-night (who went out with us), and he gave me only a look with his\\r\\naiming eye,--no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders may be done\\r\\nwith an eye by hiding it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the way home, if I had been in a humor for talking, the talk must\\r\\nhave been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of\\r\\nthe Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide\\r\\nopen, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible. But I was in\\r\\na manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old\\r\\nacquaintance, and could think of nothing else.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in\\r\\nthe kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell\\r\\nher about the bright shilling. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA bad un, I'll be bound,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Joe\\r\\ntriumphantly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cor he wouldn't have given it to the boy! Let's look at\\r\\nit.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut what's\\r\\nthis?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the\\r\\npaper. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTwo One-Pound notes?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to have\\r\\nbeen on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-markets in\\r\\nthe county. Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to the Jolly\\r\\nBargemen to restore them to their owner. While he was gone, I sat down\\r\\non my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty sure\\r\\nthat the man would not be there.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he,\\r\\nJoe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.\\r\\nThen my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them under\\r\\nsome dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in\\r\\nthe state parlor. There they remained, a nightmare to me, many and many\\r\\na night and day.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the\\r\\nstrange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of the guiltily\\r\\ncoarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of conspiracy with\\r\\nconvicts,--a feature in my low career that I had previously forgotten.\\r\\nI was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed me that when I least\\r\\nexpected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed myself to sleep by\\r\\nthinking of Miss Havisham's, next Wednesday; and in my sleep I saw\\r\\nthe file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who held it, and I\\r\\nscreamed myself awake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XI\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham's, and my hesitating\\r\\nring at the gate brought out Estella. She locked it after admitting\\r\\nme, as she had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passage\\r\\nwhere her candle stood. She took no notice of me until she had the\\r\\ncandle in her hand, when she looked over her shoulder, superciliously\\r\\nsaying, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou are to come this way to-day,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and took me to quite another\\r\\npart of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square\\r\\nbasement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square,\\r\\nhowever, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down and\\r\\nopened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in\\r\\na small paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by a\\r\\ndetached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the\\r\\nmanager or head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in the\\r\\nouter wall of this house. Like the clock in Miss Havisham's room, and\\r\\nlike Miss Havisham's watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a\\r\\nlow ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back. There was some company in\\r\\nthe room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou are to go and\\r\\nstand there boy, till you are wanted.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x9d, being the window, I\\r\\ncrossed to it, and stood Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthere,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d in a very uncomfortable state of mind,\\r\\nlooking out.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the\\r\\nneglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-tree\\r\\nthat had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new\\r\\ngrowth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different color, as if\\r\\nthat part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt. This\\r\\nwas my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had been\\r\\nsome light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge;\\r\\nbut, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden,\\r\\nand the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window,\\r\\nas if it pelted me for coming there.\\r\\n\\r\\nI divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that\\r\\nits other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the room\\r\\nexcept the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in\\r\\nall my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I had been\\r\\nstanding at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me that\\r\\nthey were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended not\\r\\nto know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the admission\\r\\nthat he or she did know it, would have made him or her out to be a toady\\r\\nand humbug.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody's pleasure,\\r\\nand the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to\\r\\nrepress a yawn. This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded\\r\\nme of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as I found\\r\\nwhen I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features. Indeed, when\\r\\nI knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had any features\\r\\nat all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her face.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPoor dear soul!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite my\\r\\nsister's. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNobody's enemy but his own!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt would be much more commendable to be somebody else's enemy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nthe gentleman; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfar more natural.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCousin Raymond,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d observed another lady, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe are to love our neighbor.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSarah Pocket,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Cousin Raymond, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif a man is not his own\\r\\nneighbor, who is?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a yawn),\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe idea!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good\\r\\nidea too. The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and\\r\\nemphatically, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cVery true!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPoor soul!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all been looking\\r\\nat me in the mean time), Ã¢\\x80\\x9che is so very strange! Would anyone believe\\r\\nthat when Tom's wife died, he actually could not be induced to see the\\r\\nimportance of the children's having the deepest of trimmings to their\\r\\nmourning? 'Good Lord!' says he, 'Camilla, what can it signify so long\\r\\nas the poor bereaved little things are in black?' So like Matthew! The\\r\\nidea!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood points in him, good points in him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Cousin Raymond; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHeaven\\r\\nforbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he never\\r\\nwill have, any sense of the proprieties.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know I was obliged,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Camilla,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI was obliged to be firm. I\\r\\nsaid, 'It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.' I told him that,\\r\\nwithout deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from\\r\\nbreakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he flung out\\r\\nin his violent way, and said, with a D, 'Then do as you like.' Thank\\r\\nGoodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly\\r\\nwent out in a pouring rain and bought the things.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe paid for them, did he not?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Estella.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned\\r\\nCamilla. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace,\\r\\nwhen I wake up in the night.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or\\r\\ncall along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the conversation\\r\\nand caused Estella to say to me, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow, boy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d On my turning round, they\\r\\nall looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went out, I heard\\r\\nSarah Pocket say, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell I am sure! What next!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and Camilla add, with\\r\\nindignation, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWas there ever such a fancy! The i-de-a!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estella stopped\\r\\nall of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her taunting manner, with\\r\\nher face quite close to mine,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, miss?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I answered, almost falling over her and checking myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAm I pretty?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes; I think you are very pretty.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAm I insulting?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot so much so as you were last time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot so much so?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe fired when she asked the last question, and she slapped my face with\\r\\nsuch force as she had, when I answered it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou little coarse monster, what do you think of me\\r\\nnow?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI shall not tell you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause you are going to tell upstairs. Is that it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat's not it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy don't you cry again, you little wretch?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause I'll never cry for you again,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Which was, I suppose, as\\r\\nfalse a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying for her\\r\\nthen, and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went on our way upstairs after this episode; and, as we were going\\r\\nup, we met a gentleman groping his way down.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhom have we here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an\\r\\nexceedingly large head, and a corresponding large hand. He took my chin\\r\\nin his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the\\r\\nlight of the candle. He was prematurely bald on the top of his head, and\\r\\nhad bushy black eyebrows that wouldn't lie down but stood up bristling.\\r\\nHis eyes were set very deep in his head, and were disagreeably sharp and\\r\\nsuspicious. He had a large watch-chain, and strong black dots where his\\r\\nbeard and whiskers would have been if he had let them. He was nothing\\r\\nto me, and I could have had no foresight then, that he ever would be\\r\\nanything to me, but it happened that I had this opportunity of observing\\r\\nhim well.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBoy of the neighborhood? Hey?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow do you come here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss Havisham sent for me, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I explained.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of boys, and\\r\\nyou're a bad set of fellows. Now mind!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, biting the side of his\\r\\ngreat forefinger as he frowned at me, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou behave yourself!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith those words, he released me--which I was glad of, for his hand\\r\\nsmelt of scented soap--and went his way downstairs. I wondered whether\\r\\nhe could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he couldn't be a doctor, or he\\r\\nwould have a quieter and more persuasive manner. There was not much time\\r\\nto consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham's room, where\\r\\nshe and everything else were just as I had left them. Estella left me\\r\\nstanding near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havisham cast her\\r\\neyes upon me from the dressing-table.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, without being startled or surprised: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe days have worn\\r\\naway, have they?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, ma'am. To-day is--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere, there, there!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d with the impatient movement of her fingers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\ndon't want to know. Are you ready to play?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was obliged to answer in some confusion, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't think I am, ma'am.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot at cards again?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she demanded, with a searching look.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, ma'am; I could do that, if I was wanted.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSince this house strikes you old and grave, boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham,\\r\\nimpatiently, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to\\r\\nfind for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen go into that opposite room,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she, pointing at the door behind\\r\\nme with her withered hand, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand wait there till I come.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.\\r\\nFrom that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had an\\r\\nairless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in\\r\\nthe damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than\\r\\nto burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder\\r\\nthan the clearer air,--like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry branches\\r\\nof candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the chamber; or it\\r\\nwould be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its darkness. It was\\r\\nspacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but every discernible\\r\\nthing in it was covered with dust and mould, and dropping to pieces. The\\r\\nmost prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it,\\r\\nas if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all\\r\\nstopped together. An epergne or centre-piece of some kind was in the\\r\\nmiddle of this cloth; it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its\\r\\nform was quite undistinguishable; and, as I looked along the yellow\\r\\nexpanse out of which I remember its seeming to grow, like a black\\r\\nfungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home\\r\\nto it, and running out from it, as if some circumstances of the greatest\\r\\npublic importance had just transpired in the spider community.\\r\\n\\r\\nI heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same\\r\\noccurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetles took\\r\\nno notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a ponderous\\r\\nelderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of hearing, and not\\r\\non terms with one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching\\r\\nthem from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.\\r\\nIn her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned, and\\r\\nshe looked like the Witch of the place.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis where I\\r\\nwill be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and\\r\\nthere and die at once, the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork\\r\\nat the Fair, I shrank under her touch.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think that is?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked me, again pointing with her\\r\\nstick; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat, where those cobwebs are?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI can't guess what it is, ma'am.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,\\r\\nleaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome, come, come!\\r\\nWalk me, walk me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss\\r\\nHavisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and\\r\\nshe leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have\\r\\nbeen an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr.\\r\\nPumblechook's chaise-cart.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was not physically strong, and after a little time said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSlower!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Still, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she\\r\\ntwitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me to\\r\\nbelieve that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast. After a\\r\\nwhile she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCall Estella!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d so I went out on the landing and\\r\\nroared that name as I had done on the previous occasion. When her light\\r\\nappeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round\\r\\nand round the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should\\r\\nhave felt sufficiently discontented; but as she brought with her the\\r\\nthree ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn't know\\r\\nwhat to do. In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss\\r\\nHavisham twitched my shoulder, and we posted on,--with a shame-faced\\r\\nconsciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear Miss Havisham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Sarah Pocket. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow well you look!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI do not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Miss Havisham. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am yellow skin and bone.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCamilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and she\\r\\nmurmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPoor dear\\r\\nsoul! Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd how are you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were close to\\r\\nCamilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss\\r\\nHavisham wouldn't stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly\\r\\nobnoxious to Camilla.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThank you, Miss Havisham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she returned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am as well as can be\\r\\nexpected.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, what's the matter with you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding\\r\\nsharpness.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNothing worth mentioning,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied Camilla. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't wish to make a\\r\\ndisplay of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in the\\r\\nnight than I am quite equal to.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen don't think of me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d retorted Miss Havisham.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery easily said!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a\\r\\nhitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cRaymond is a\\r\\nwitness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.\\r\\nRaymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings\\r\\nand nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with\\r\\nanxiety of those I love. If I could be less affectionate and sensitive,\\r\\nI should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure\\r\\nI wish it could be so. But as to not thinking of you in the night--The\\r\\nidea!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Here, a burst of tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and\\r\\nhim I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He came to the rescue at this point,\\r\\nand said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCamilla, my dear, it\\r\\nis well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to\\r\\nthe extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am not aware,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but\\r\\nonce, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that\\r\\nperson, my dear.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated\\r\\nold woman, with a small face that might have been made of walnut-shells,\\r\\nand a large mouth like a cat's without the whiskers, supported this\\r\\nposition by saying, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed, my dear. Hem!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThinking is easy enough,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the grave lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is easier, you know?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d assented Miss Sarah Pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, yes!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to\\r\\nrise from her legs to her bosom. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt's all very true! It's a weakness\\r\\nto be so affectionate, but I can't help it. No doubt my health would be\\r\\nmuch better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn't change my disposition\\r\\nif I could. It's the cause of much suffering, but it's a consolation to\\r\\nknow I posses it, when I wake up in the night.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Here another burst of\\r\\nfeeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going\\r\\nround and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the\\r\\nvisitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere's Matthew!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Camilla. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNever mixing with any natural ties,\\r\\nnever coming here to see how Miss Havisham is! I have taken to the sofa\\r\\nwith my staylace cut, and have lain there hours insensible, with my head\\r\\nover the side, and my hair all down, and my feet I don't know where--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n(Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMuch higher than your head, my love,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Camilla.)\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account of\\r\\nMatthew's strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cReally I must say I should think not!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d interposed the grave lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou see, my dear,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d added Miss Sarah Pocket (a blandly vicious\\r\\npersonage), Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe question to put to yourself is, who did you expect to\\r\\nthank you, my love?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWithout expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d resumed\\r\\nCamilla, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raymond\\r\\nis a witness of the extent to which I have choked, and what the total\\r\\ninefficacy of ginger has been, and I have been heard at the piano-forte\\r\\ntuner's across the street, where the poor mistaken children have even\\r\\nsupposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance,--and now to be told--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Here Camilla put her hand to her throat, and began to be quite chemical\\r\\nas to the formation of new combinations there.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me and\\r\\nherself, and stood looking at the speaker. This change had a great\\r\\ninfluence in bringing Camilla's chemistry to a sudden end.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMatthew will come and see me at last,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham, sternly,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cwhen I am laid on that table. That will be his place,--there,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d striking\\r\\nthe table with her stick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cat my head! And yours will be there! And your\\r\\nhusband's there! And Sarah Pocket's there! And Georgiana's there! Now\\r\\nyou all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me.\\r\\nAnd now go!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the mention of each name, she had struck the table with her stick in\\r\\na new place. She now said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWalk me, walk me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and we went on again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose there's nothing to be done,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Camilla, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut comply\\r\\nand depart. It's something to have seen the object of one's love and\\r\\nduty for even so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholy\\r\\nsatisfaction when I wake up in the night. I wish Matthew could have\\r\\nthat comfort, but he sets it at defiance. I am determined not to make a\\r\\ndisplay of my feelings, but it's very hard to be told one wants to feast\\r\\non one's relations,--as if one was a Giant,--and to be told to go. The\\r\\nbare idea!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her hand upon her heaving\\r\\nbosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I\\r\\nsupposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of\\r\\nview, and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth. Sarah\\r\\nPocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last; but Sarah was\\r\\ntoo knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artful\\r\\nslipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence. Sarah\\r\\nPocket then made her separate effect of departing with, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBless you, Miss\\r\\nHavisham dear!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and with a smile of forgiving pity on her walnut-shell\\r\\ncountenance for the weaknesses of the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walked\\r\\nwith her hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At last she\\r\\nstopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it\\r\\nsome seconds,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is my birthday, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was going to wish her many happy returns, when she lifted her stick.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't suffer it to be spoken of. I don't suffer those who were here\\r\\njust now, or any one to speak of it. They come here on the day, but they\\r\\ndare not refer to it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course I made no further effort to refer to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOn this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of\\r\\ndecay,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the\\r\\ntable, but not touching it, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwas brought here. It and I have worn away\\r\\ntogether. The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of\\r\\nmice have gnawed at me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking\\r\\nat the table; she in her once white dress, all yellow and withered; the\\r\\nonce white cloth all yellow and withered; everything around in a state\\r\\nto crumble under a touch.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen the ruin is complete,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she, with a ghastly look, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand when\\r\\nthey lay me dead, in my bride's dress on the bride's table,--which shall\\r\\nbe done, and which will be the finished curse upon him,--so much the\\r\\nbetter if it is done on this day!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure\\r\\nlying there. I remained quiet. Estella returned, and she too remained\\r\\nquiet. It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time. In\\r\\nthe heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded in its\\r\\nremoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and I might\\r\\npresently begin to decay.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, not coming out of her distraught state by degrees, but in an\\r\\ninstant, Miss Havisham said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet me see you two play cards; why have\\r\\nyou not begun?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d With that, we returned to her room, and sat down as\\r\\nbefore; I was beggared, as before; and again, as before, Miss Havisham\\r\\nwatched us all the time, directed my attention to Estella's beauty, and\\r\\nmade me notice it the more by trying her jewels on Estella's breast and\\r\\nhair.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstella, for her part, likewise treated me as before, except that she\\r\\ndid not condescend to speak. When we had played some half-dozen games,\\r\\na day was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yard\\r\\nto be fed in the former dog-like manner. There, too, I was again left to\\r\\nwander about as I liked.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which\\r\\nI had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last\\r\\noccasion, open or shut. Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I\\r\\nsaw one now. As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had let\\r\\nthe visitors out,--for she had returned with the keys in her hand,--I\\r\\nstrolled into the garden, and strolled all over it. It was quite a\\r\\nwilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it,\\r\\nwhich seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of\\r\\nweak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then a weedy\\r\\noffshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but\\r\\na fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismal\\r\\ncorner upon which I had looked out of the window. Never questioning for\\r\\na moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window,\\r\\nand found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with a\\r\\npale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside me.\\r\\nHe had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him, and I\\r\\nnow saw that he was inky.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHalloa!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyoung fellow!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHalloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to\\r\\nbe best answered by itself, I said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHalloa!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d politely omitting young\\r\\nfellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWho let you in?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss Estella.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWho gave you leave to prowl about?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss Estella.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCome and fight,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the pale young gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat could I do but follow him? I have often asked myself the question\\r\\nsince; but what else could I do? His manner was so final, and I was\\r\\nso astonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under a\\r\\nspell.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cStop a minute, though,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, wheeling round before we had gone many\\r\\npaces. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There it is!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against one\\r\\nanother, daintily flung one of his legs up behind him, pulled my hair,\\r\\nslapped his hands again, dipped his head, and butted it into my stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was\\r\\nunquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was\\r\\nparticularly disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hit out\\r\\nat him and was going to hit out again, when he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAha! Would you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled\\r\\nwithin my limited experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLaws of the game!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he. Here, he skipped from his left leg on to\\r\\nhis right. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cRegular rules!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Here, he skipped from his right leg on to\\r\\nhis left. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Here,\\r\\nhe dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I\\r\\nlooked helplessly at him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but I felt\\r\\nmorally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have\\r\\nhad no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to\\r\\nconsider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I\\r\\nfollowed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by\\r\\nthe junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his asking me\\r\\nif I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he begged my\\r\\nleave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned with a bottle\\r\\nof water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAvailable for both,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said,\\r\\nplacing these against the wall. And then fell to pulling off, not\\r\\nonly his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a manner at once\\r\\nlight-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough he did not look very healthy,--having pimples on his face, and\\r\\na breaking out at his mouth,--these dreadful preparations quite appalled\\r\\nme. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and he\\r\\nhad a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. For\\r\\nthe rest, he was a young gentleman in a gray suit (when not denuded\\r\\nfor battle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in\\r\\nadvance of the rest of him as to development.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every\\r\\ndemonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he were\\r\\nminutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life,\\r\\nas I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his\\r\\nback, looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly\\r\\nfore-shortened.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with\\r\\na great show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest\\r\\nsurprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again,\\r\\nlooking up at me out of a black eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have no\\r\\nstrength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked down;\\r\\nbut he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or drinking out\\r\\nof the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself\\r\\naccording to form, and then came at me with an air and a show that made\\r\\nme believe he really was going to do for me at last. He got heavily\\r\\nbruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I hit him, the harder I\\r\\nhit him; but he came up again and again and again, until at last he got\\r\\na bad fall with the back of his head against the wall. Even after that\\r\\ncrisis in our affairs, he got up and turned round and round confusedly a\\r\\nfew times, not knowing where I was; but finally went on his knees to his\\r\\nsponge and threw it up: at the same time panting out, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThat means you\\r\\nhave won.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the\\r\\ncontest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go\\r\\nso far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of\\r\\nsavage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly\\r\\nwiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCan I help you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n and he said Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo thankee,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and I said Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGood afternoon,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and he said Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSame\\r\\nto you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys.\\r\\nBut she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept her\\r\\nwaiting; and there was a bright flush upon her face, as though something\\r\\nhad happened to delight her. Instead of going straight to the gate, too,\\r\\nshe stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCome here! You may kiss me, if you like.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI kissed her cheek as she turned it to me. I think I would have gone\\r\\nthrough a great deal to kiss her cheek. But I felt that the kiss was\\r\\ngiven to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, and\\r\\nthat it was worth nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with\\r\\nthe fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the light\\r\\non the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against\\r\\na black night-sky, and Joe's furnace was flinging a path of fire across\\r\\nthe road.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XII\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman. The\\r\\nmore I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman on\\r\\nhis back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the\\r\\nmore certain it appeared that something would be done to me. I felt that\\r\\nthe pale young gentleman's blood was on my head, and that the Law would\\r\\navenge it. Without having any definite idea of the penalties I had\\r\\nincurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking\\r\\nabout the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into\\r\\nthe studious youth of England, without laying themselves open to severe\\r\\npunishment. For some days, I even kept close at home, and looked out at\\r\\nthe kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going\\r\\non an errand, lest the officers of the County Jail should pounce upon\\r\\nme. The pale young gentleman's nose had stained my trousers, and I tried\\r\\nto wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night. I had cut\\r\\nmy knuckles against the pale young gentleman's teeth, and I twisted my\\r\\nimagination into a thousand tangles, as I devised incredible ways of\\r\\naccounting for that damnatory circumstance when I should be haled before\\r\\nthe Judges.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of\\r\\nviolence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons of Justice,\\r\\nspecially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush behind the\\r\\ngate;--whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal vengeance for\\r\\nan outrage done to her house, might rise in those grave-clothes of hers,\\r\\ndraw a pistol, and shoot me dead:--whether suborned boys--a numerous\\r\\nband of mercenaries--might be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery,\\r\\nand cuff me until I was no more;--it was high testimony to my confidence\\r\\nin the spirit of the pale young gentleman, that I never imagined him\\r\\naccessory to these retaliations; they always came into my mind as the\\r\\nacts of injudicious relatives of his, goaded on by the state of his\\r\\nvisage and an indignant sympathy with the family features.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, go to Miss Havisham's I must, and go I did. And behold! nothing\\r\\ncame of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way, and no pale\\r\\nyoung gentleman was to be discovered on the premises. I found the same\\r\\ngate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked in at the windows\\r\\nof the detached house; but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed\\r\\nshutters within, and all was lifeless. Only in the corner where\\r\\nthe combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the young\\r\\ngentleman's existence. There were traces of his gore in that spot, and I\\r\\ncovered them with garden-mould from the eye of man.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the broad landing between Miss Havisham's own room and that other\\r\\nroom in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,--a\\r\\nlight chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind. It had been placed\\r\\nthere since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular\\r\\noccupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired of\\r\\nwalking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and across\\r\\nthe landing, and round the other room. Over and over and over again,\\r\\nwe would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as long as\\r\\nthree hours at a stretch. I insensibly fall into a general mention of\\r\\nthese journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled that I should\\r\\nreturn every alternate day at noon for these purposes, and because I am\\r\\nnow going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more\\r\\nto me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was\\r\\nI going to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I\\r\\nbelieved; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know\\r\\neverything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that\\r\\ndesirable end. But she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer my\\r\\nbeing ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money,--or anything\\r\\nbut my daily dinner,--nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my\\r\\nservices.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told\\r\\nme I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me;\\r\\nsometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would be quite\\r\\nfamiliar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she\\r\\nhated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were\\r\\nalone, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDoes she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And when I said yes\\r\\n(for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when we\\r\\nplayed at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish of\\r\\nEstella's moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods were\\r\\nso many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what\\r\\nto say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness,\\r\\nmurmuring something in her ear that sounded like Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBreak their hearts my\\r\\npride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which the\\r\\nburden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of rendering\\r\\nhomage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in that relation\\r\\ntowards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon\\r\\niron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of Old Clem's\\r\\nrespected name. Thus, you were to hammer boys round--Old Clem! With a\\r\\nthump and a sound--Old Clem! Beat it out, beat it out--Old Clem! With a\\r\\nclink for the stout--Old Clem! Blow the fire, blow the fire--Old\\r\\nClem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher--Old Clem! One day soon after the\\r\\nappearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly saying to me, with the\\r\\nimpatient movement of her fingers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere, there, there! Sing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I was\\r\\nsurprised into crooning this ditty as I pushed her over the floor. It\\r\\nhappened so to catch her fancy that she took it up in a low brooding\\r\\nvoice as if she were singing in her sleep. After that, it became\\r\\ncustomary with us to have it as we moved about, and Estella would often\\r\\njoin in; though the whole strain was so subdued, even when there were\\r\\nthree of us, that it made less noise in the grim old house than the\\r\\nlightest breath of wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat could I become with these surroundings? How could my character fail\\r\\nto be influenced by them? Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were\\r\\ndazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light from the\\r\\nmisty yellow rooms?\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had\\r\\nnot previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which\\r\\nI had confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly\\r\\nfail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger\\r\\nto be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of him.\\r\\nBesides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella discussed,\\r\\nwhich had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more potent as time\\r\\nwent on. I reposed complete confidence in no one but Biddy; but I told\\r\\npoor Biddy everything. Why it came natural to me to do so, and why Biddy\\r\\nhad a deep concern in everything I told her, I did not know then, though\\r\\nI think I know now.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with\\r\\nalmost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass,\\r\\nPumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of\\r\\ndiscussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (to\\r\\nthis hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if these hands\\r\\ncould have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they would have done\\r\\nit. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind, that\\r\\nhe could not discuss my prospects without having me before him,--as it\\r\\nwere, to operate upon,--and he would drag me up from my stool (usually\\r\\nby the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me before the\\r\\nfire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Mum,\\r\\nhere is this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up by hand. Hold up\\r\\nyour head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which so did do. Now,\\r\\nMum, with respections to this boy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And then he would rumple my hair\\r\\nthe wrong way,--which from my earliest remembrance, as already hinted,\\r\\nI have in my soul denied the right of any fellow-creature to do,--and\\r\\nwould hold me before him by the sleeve,--a spectacle of imbecility only\\r\\nto be equalled by himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations\\r\\nabout Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me,\\r\\nthat I used to want--quite painfully--to burst into spiteful tears, fly\\r\\nat Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sister\\r\\nspoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at\\r\\nevery reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,\\r\\nwould sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of\\r\\nmy fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at,\\r\\nwhile they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe's perceiving that\\r\\nhe was not favorable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old\\r\\nenough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on\\r\\nhis knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my\\r\\nsister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition\\r\\non his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out of his\\r\\nhands, shake him, and put it away. There was a most irritating end to\\r\\nevery one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to lead up to\\r\\nit, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching sight of me as\\r\\nit were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome! there's enough of\\r\\nyou! You get along to bed; you've given trouble enough for one night, I\\r\\nhope!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d As if I had besought them as a favor to bother my life out.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we\\r\\nshould continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss\\r\\nHavisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on my\\r\\nshoulder; and said with some displeasure,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are growing tall, Pip!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look, that\\r\\nthis might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no control.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said no more at the time; but she presently stopped and looked at me\\r\\nagain; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning and moody.\\r\\nOn the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise was over, and\\r\\nI had landed her at her dressing-table, she stayed me with a movement of\\r\\nher impatient fingers:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cJoe Gargery, ma'am.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMeaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Miss Havisham.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here with\\r\\nyou, and bring your indentures, do you think?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honor to be\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen let him come.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt any particular time, Miss Havisham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere, there! I know nothing about times. Let him come soon, and come\\r\\nalong with you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cwent on the Rampage,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d in a more alarming degree than at any previous\\r\\nperiod. She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was door-mats under\\r\\nour feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what company we graciously\\r\\nthought she was fit for? When she had exhausted a torrent of such\\r\\ninquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud sobbing,\\r\\ngot out the dustpan,--which was always a very bad sign,--put on her\\r\\ncoarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent. Not satisfied\\r\\nwith a dry cleaning, she took to a pail and scrubbing-brush, and cleaned\\r\\nus out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in the back-yard.\\r\\nIt was ten o'clock at night before we ventured to creep in again, and\\r\\nthen she asked Joe why he hadn't married a Negress Slave at once?\\r\\nJoe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his whisker and\\r\\nlooking dejectedly at me, as if he thought it really might have been a\\r\\nbetter speculation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XIII\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see\\r\\nJoe arraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss\\r\\nHavisham's. However, as he thought his court-suit necessary to the\\r\\noccasion, it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in his\\r\\nworking-dress; the rather, because I knew he made himself so dreadfully\\r\\nuncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was for me he pulled\\r\\nup his shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made the hair on the\\r\\ncrown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt breakfast-time my sister declared her intention of going to town with\\r\\nus, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook's and called for Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhen we had\\r\\ndone with our fine ladiesÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--a way of putting the case, from which Joe\\r\\nappeared inclined to augur the worst. The forge was shut up for the day,\\r\\nand Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door (as it was his custom to do on\\r\\nthe very rare occasions when he was not at work) the monosyllable\\r\\nHOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the\\r\\ndirection he had taken.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large beaver\\r\\nbonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited\\r\\nStraw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it\\r\\nwas a fine bright day. I am not quite clear whether these articles were\\r\\ncarried penitentially or ostentatiously; but I rather think they were\\r\\ndisplayed as articles of property,--much as Cleopatra or any other\\r\\nsovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or\\r\\nprocession.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we came to Pumblechook's, my sister bounced in and left us. As it\\r\\nwas almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham's house.\\r\\nEstella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she appeared, Joe took\\r\\nhis hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands; as if\\r\\nhe had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a\\r\\nquarter of an ounce.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knew\\r\\nso well. I followed next to her, and Joe came last. When I looked back\\r\\nat Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with the\\r\\ngreatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of\\r\\nhis toes.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coat-cuff\\r\\nand conducted him into Miss Havisham's presence. She was seated at her\\r\\ndressing-table, and looked round at us immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she to Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou are the husband of the sister of this boy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or\\r\\nso like some extraordinary bird; standing as he did speechless, with his\\r\\ntuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are the husband,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated Miss Havisham, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cof the sister of this\\r\\nboy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Joe persisted in\\r\\naddressing Me instead of Miss Havisham.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich I meantersay, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe now observed in a manner that was at\\r\\nonce expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great\\r\\npoliteness, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas I hup and married your sister, and I were at the time\\r\\nwhat you might call (if you was anyways inclined) a single man.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd you have reared the boy, with the\\r\\nintention of taking him for your apprentice; is that so, Mr. Gargery?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas you and me were ever friends, and it\\r\\nwere looked for'ard to betwixt us, as being calc'lated to lead to\\r\\nlarks. Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the\\r\\nbusiness,--such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like,--not\\r\\nbut what they would have been attended to, don't you see?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHas the boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cever made any objection? Does he\\r\\nlike the trade?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich it is well beknown to yourself, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Joe, strengthening\\r\\nhis former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and politeness, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat\\r\\nit were the wish of your own hart.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (I saw the idea suddenly break upon\\r\\nhim that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion, before he went on\\r\\nto say) Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd there weren't no objection on your part, and Pip it were\\r\\nthe great wish of your hart!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was quite in vain for me to endeavor to make him sensible that he\\r\\nought to speak to Miss Havisham. The more I made faces and gestures\\r\\nto him to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, he\\r\\npersisted in being to Me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you brought his indentures with you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Miss Havisham.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Pip, you know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied Joe, as if that were a little\\r\\nunreasonable, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou yourself see me put 'em in my 'at, and therefore you\\r\\nknow as they are here.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d With which he took them out, and gave them, not\\r\\nto Miss Havisham, but to me. I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good\\r\\nfellow,--I know I was ashamed of him,--when I saw that Estella stood\\r\\nat the back of Miss Havisham's chair, and that her eyes laughed\\r\\nmischievously. I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to\\r\\nMiss Havisham.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou expected,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cno premium\\r\\nwith the boy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cJoe!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I remonstrated, for he made no reply at all. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy don't you\\r\\nanswer--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhich I\\r\\nmeantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself\\r\\nand me, and which you know the answer to be full well No. You know it to\\r\\nbe No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was\\r\\nbetter than I had thought possible, seeing what he was there; and took\\r\\nup a little bag from the table beside her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPip has earned a premium here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand here it is. There are\\r\\nfive-and-twenty guineas in this bag. Give it to your master, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in\\r\\nhim by her strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass,\\r\\npersisted in addressing me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is wery liberal on your part, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand it is as such\\r\\nreceived and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near,\\r\\nnor nowheres. And now, old chap,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, conveying to me a sensation,\\r\\nfirst of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that familiar\\r\\nexpression were applied to Miss Havisham,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand now, old chap, may we\\r\\ndo our duty! May you and me do our duty, both on us, by one and another,\\r\\nand by them which your liberal present--have-conweyed--to be--for the\\r\\nsatisfaction of mind-of--them as never--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d here Joe showed that he felt\\r\\nhe had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he triumphantly rescued\\r\\nhimself with the words, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand from myself far be it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d These words had\\r\\nsuch a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood-bye, Pip!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet them out, Estella.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAm I to come again, Miss Havisham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. Gargery is your master now. Gargery! One word!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to Joe\\r\\nin a distinct emphatic voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe boy has been a good boy here, and\\r\\nthat is his reward. Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no\\r\\nother and no more.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but\\r\\nI know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs\\r\\ninstead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went\\r\\nafter him and laid hold of him. In another minute we were outside the\\r\\ngate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone. When we stood in the\\r\\ndaylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAstonishing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And there he remained so long saying, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAstonishingÃ¢\\x80\\x9d at\\r\\nintervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never coming\\r\\nback. At length he prolonged his remark into Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPip, I do assure you this\\r\\nis as-TON-ishing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and so, by degrees, became conversational and able to\\r\\nwalk away.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have reason to think that Joe's intellects were brightened by the\\r\\nencounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook's\\r\\nhe invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in\\r\\nwhat took place in Mr. Pumblechook's parlor: where, on our presenting\\r\\nourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried my sister, addressing us both at once. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd what's\\r\\nhappened to you? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor\\r\\nsociety as this, I am sure I do!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss Havisham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of\\r\\nremembrance, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmade it wery partick'ler that we should give her--were it\\r\\ncompliments or respects, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCompliments,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich that were my own belief,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d answered Joe; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cher compliments to Mrs.\\r\\nJ. Gargery--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMuch good they'll do me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d observed my sister; but rather gratified too.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd wishing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like another\\r\\neffort of remembrance, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat the state of Miss Havisham's elth were\\r\\nsitch as would have--allowed, were it, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf her having the pleasure,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I added.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf ladies' company,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe. And drew a long breath.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but\\r\\nit's better late than never. And what did she give young Rantipole\\r\\nhere?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe giv' him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnothing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat she giv',Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cshe giv' to his friends. 'And by his\\r\\nfriends,' were her explanation, 'I mean into the hands of his sister\\r\\nMrs. J. Gargery.' Them were her words; 'Mrs. J. Gargery.' She mayn't\\r\\nhave know'd,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhether it\\r\\nwere Joe, or Jorge.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his wooden\\r\\narm-chair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known all\\r\\nabout it beforehand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd how much have you got?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked my sister, laughing. Positively\\r\\nlaughing!\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat would present company say to ten pound?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d demanded Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey'd say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned my sister, curtly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cpretty well. Not too much,\\r\\nbut pretty well.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's more than that, then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he\\r\\nrubbed the arms of his chair, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt's more than that, Mum.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, you don't mean to say--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d began my sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes I do, Mum,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Pumblechook; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Good\\r\\nin you! Go on!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat would present company say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d proceeded Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto twenty pound?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHandsome would be the word,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned my sister.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt's more than twenty pound.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a\\r\\npatronizing laugh, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt's more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow her up,\\r\\nJoseph!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen to make an end of it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to my\\r\\nsister; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit's five-and-twenty pound.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's five-and-twenty pound, Mum,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d echoed that basest of swindlers,\\r\\nPumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand it's no more than your\\r\\nmerits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joy of the\\r\\nmoney!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the villain had stopped here, his case would have been sufficiently\\r\\nawful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody,\\r\\nwith a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far\\r\\nbehind.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow you see, Joseph and wife,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Pumblechook, as he took me by the\\r\\narm above the elbow, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am one of them that always go right through with\\r\\nwhat they've begun. This boy must be bound, out of hand. That's my way.\\r\\nBound out of hand.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGoodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my sister (grasping the\\r\\nmoney), Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe're deeply beholden to you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNever mind me, Mum,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned that diabolical cornchandler. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA\\r\\npleasure's a pleasure all the world over. But this boy, you know; we\\r\\nmust have him bound. I said I'd see to it--to tell you the truth.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at\\r\\nonce went over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial\\r\\npresence. I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook,\\r\\nexactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick; indeed,\\r\\nit was the general impression in Court that I had been taken red-handed;\\r\\nfor, as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd, I heard some\\r\\npeople say, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat's he done?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and others, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe's a young 'un, too, but\\r\\nlooks bad, don't he?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d One person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave\\r\\nme a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted\\r\\nup with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and entitled TO BE READ IN MY\\r\\nCELL.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a\\r\\nchurch,--and with people hanging over the pews looking on,--and with\\r\\nmighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs, with\\r\\nfolded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading\\r\\nthe newspapers,--and with some shining black portraits on the walls,\\r\\nwhich my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and\\r\\nsticking-plaster. Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed and\\r\\nattested, and I was Ã¢\\x80\\x9cboundÃ¢\\x80\\x9d; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while\\r\\nas if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those little\\r\\npreliminaries disposed of.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been put\\r\\ninto great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured,\\r\\nand who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely\\r\\nrallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook's. And there my sister\\r\\nbecame so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would serve\\r\\nher but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue Boar, and\\r\\nthat Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bring the Hubbles\\r\\nand Mr. Wopsle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For,\\r\\nit inscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole\\r\\ncompany, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make it\\r\\nworse, they all asked me from time to time,--in short, whenever they\\r\\nhad nothing else to do,--why I didn't enjoy myself? And what could I\\r\\npossibly do then, but say I was enjoying myself,--when I wasn't!\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the\\r\\nmost of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent\\r\\ncontriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table;\\r\\nand, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had\\r\\nfiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I\\r\\nplayed at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company,\\r\\nor indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared\\r\\nto contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair\\r\\nbeside him to illustrate his remarks.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they wouldn't\\r\\nlet me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off, woke me up\\r\\nand told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the evening Mr. Wopsle\\r\\ngave us Collins's ode, and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder\\r\\ndown, with such effect, that a waiter came in and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe Commercials\\r\\nunderneath sent up their compliments, and it wasn't the Tumblers' Arms.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n That, they were all in excellent spirits on the road home, and sang, O\\r\\nLady Fair! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and asserting with a tremendously\\r\\nstrong voice (in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece\\r\\nof music in a most impertinent manner, by wanting to know all about\\r\\neverybody's private affairs) that he was the man with his white locks\\r\\nflowing, and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly\\r\\nwretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like\\r\\nJoe's trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XIV\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. There may be black\\r\\ningratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive and well\\r\\ndeserved; but that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.\\r\\n\\r\\nHome had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my sister's\\r\\ntemper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it. I had\\r\\nbelieved in the best parlor as a most elegant saloon; I had believed\\r\\nin the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose\\r\\nsolemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; I had\\r\\nbelieved in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment;\\r\\nI had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and\\r\\nindependence. Within a single year all this was changed. Now it was all\\r\\ncoarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella\\r\\nsee it on any account.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault,\\r\\nhow much Miss Havisham's, how much my sister's, is now of no moment to\\r\\nme or to any one. The change was made in me; the thing was done. Well or\\r\\nill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my\\r\\nshirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Joe's 'prentice, I should be\\r\\ndistinguished and happy. Now the reality was in my hold, I only felt\\r\\nthat I was dusty with the dust of small-coal, and that I had a weight\\r\\nupon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather. There have\\r\\nbeen occasions in my later life (I suppose as in most lives) when I have\\r\\nfelt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest\\r\\nand romance, to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more.\\r\\nNever has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when my way in\\r\\nlife lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road\\r\\nof apprenticeship to Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember that at a later period of my Ã¢\\x80\\x9ctime,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I used to stand about\\r\\nthe churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing my\\r\\nown perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likeness\\r\\nbetween them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on both\\r\\nthere came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea. I was quite\\r\\nas dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that\\r\\nafter-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe\\r\\nwhile my indentures lasted. It is about the only thing I am glad to know\\r\\nof myself in that connection.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I\\r\\nproceed to add was Joe's. It was not because I was faithful, but because\\r\\nJoe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier or\\r\\na sailor. It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of\\r\\nindustry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry,\\r\\nthat I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain. It is not possible\\r\\nto know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing\\r\\nman flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it has\\r\\ntouched one's self in going by, and I know right well that any good that\\r\\nintermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented Joe,\\r\\nand not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I wanted, who can say? How can I say, when I never knew? What\\r\\nI dreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and\\r\\ncommonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one\\r\\nof the wooden windows of the forge. I was haunted by the fear that she\\r\\nwould, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing\\r\\nthe coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me.\\r\\nOften after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we were\\r\\nsinging Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss\\r\\nHavisham's would seem to show me Estella's face in the fire, with her\\r\\npretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,--often at\\r\\nsuch a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the wall\\r\\nwhich the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her just\\r\\ndrawing her face away, and would believe that she had come at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that, when we went into supper, the place and the meal would have\\r\\na more homely look than ever, and I would feel more ashamed of home than\\r\\never, in my own ungracious breast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XV\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's room, my\\r\\neducation under that preposterous female terminated. Not, however, until\\r\\nBiddy had imparted to me everything she knew, from the little catalogue\\r\\nof prices, to a comic song she had once bought for a half-penny.\\r\\nAlthough the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were\\r\\nthe opening lines.\\r\\n\\r\\n     When I went to Lunnon town sirs,\\r\\n     Too rul loo rul\\r\\n     Too rul loo rul\\r\\n     Wasn't I done very brown sirs?\\r\\n     Too rul loo rul\\r\\n     Too rul loo rul\\r\\n\\r\\n--still, in my desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit, except that I\\r\\nthought (as I still do) the amount of Too rul somewhat in excess of the\\r\\npoetry. In my hunger for information, I made proposals to Mr. Wopsle to\\r\\nbestow some intellectual crumbs upon me, with which he kindly complied.\\r\\nAs it turned out, however, that he only wanted me for a dramatic\\r\\nlay-figure, to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied\\r\\nand clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways, I soon\\r\\ndeclined that course of instruction; though not until Mr. Wopsle in his\\r\\npoetic fury had severely mauled me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe. This statement sounds so\\r\\nwell, that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained. I wanted\\r\\nto make Joe less ignorant and common, that he might be worthier of my\\r\\nsociety and less open to Estella's reproach.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a broken\\r\\nslate and a short piece of slate-pencil were our educational implements:\\r\\nto which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco. I never knew Joe to\\r\\nremember anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire, under my\\r\\ntuition, any piece of information whatever. Yet he would smoke his pipe\\r\\nat the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else,--even\\r\\nwith a learned air,--as if he considered himself to be advancing\\r\\nimmensely. Dear fellow, I hope he did.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the river passing\\r\\nbeyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was low, looking\\r\\nas if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the\\r\\nbottom of the water. Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea\\r\\nwith their white sails spread, I somehow thought of Miss Havisham and\\r\\nEstella; and whenever the light struck aslant, afar off, upon a cloud\\r\\nor sail or green hillside or water-line, it was just the same.--Miss\\r\\nHavisham and Estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared\\r\\nto have something to do with everything that was picturesque.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his pipe, had so plumed himself on\\r\\nbeing Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmost awful dull,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d that I had given him up for the day, I lay on\\r\\nthe earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descrying traces of\\r\\nMiss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the sky and in the\\r\\nwater, until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them\\r\\nthat had been much in my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cJoe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdon't you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Joe, slowly considering. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat for?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat for, Joe? What is any visit made for?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere is some wisits p'r'aps,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas for ever remains open to\\r\\nthe question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She might\\r\\nthink you wanted something,--expected something of her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDon't you think I might say that I did not, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou might, old chap,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd she might credit it. Similarly she\\r\\nmightn't.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled hard\\r\\nat his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou see, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMiss\\r\\nHavisham done the handsome thing by you. When Miss Havisham done the\\r\\nhandsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that were\\r\\nall.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Joe. I heard her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cALL,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe repeated, very emphatically.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Joe. I tell you, I heard her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were,--Make a\\r\\nend on it!--As you was!--Me to the North, and you to the South!--Keep in\\r\\nsunders!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me\\r\\nto find that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more\\r\\nprobable.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut, Joe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, old chap.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHere am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day\\r\\nof my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked after\\r\\nher, or shown that I remember her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes\\r\\nall four round,--and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all\\r\\nfour round might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of\\r\\nhoofs--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don't mean a present.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOr even,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif you was helped to knocking her up a new chain\\r\\nfor the front door,--or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws for\\r\\ngeneral use,--or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-fork\\r\\nwhen she took her muffins,--or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such\\r\\nlike--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't mean any present at all, Joe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I interposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly\\r\\npressed it, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn't. No, I would not. For\\r\\nwhat's a door-chain when she's got one always up? And shark-headers is\\r\\nopen to misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork, you'd go into\\r\\nbrass and do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest workman can't show\\r\\nhimself oncommon in a gridiron,--for a gridiron IS a gridiron,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nJoe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouring to\\r\\nrouse me from a fixed delusion, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand you may haim at what you like, but\\r\\na gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your leave,\\r\\nand you can't help yourself--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear Joe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdon't\\r\\ngo on in that way. I never thought of making Miss Havisham any present.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, all\\r\\nalong; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack\\r\\njust now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I would\\r\\ngo uptown and make a call on Miss Est--Havisham.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich her name,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, gravely, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cain't Estavisham, Pip, unless she\\r\\nhave been rechris'ened.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it,\\r\\nJoe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well of\\r\\nit. But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received\\r\\nwith cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a\\r\\nvisit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a\\r\\nfavor received, then this experimental trip should have no successor. By\\r\\nthese conditions I promised to abide.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick.\\r\\nHe pretended that his Christian name was Dolge,--a clear\\r\\nImpossibility,--but he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I\\r\\nbelieve him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but\\r\\nwilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its\\r\\nunderstanding. He was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of\\r\\ngreat strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. He never even\\r\\nseemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by mere\\r\\naccident; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his dinner, or\\r\\nwent away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or the Wandering Jew,\\r\\nas if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever\\r\\ncoming back. He lodged at a sluice-keeper's out on the marshes, and on\\r\\nworking-days would come slouching from his hermitage, with his hands in\\r\\nhis pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck\\r\\nand dangling on his back. On Sundays he mostly lay all day on the\\r\\nsluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns. He always slouched,\\r\\nlocomotively, with his eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or\\r\\notherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a half-resentful,\\r\\nhalf-puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had was, that it\\r\\nwas rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis morose journeyman had no liking for me. When I was very small and\\r\\ntimid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner\\r\\nof the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well: also that it was\\r\\nnecessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy, and\\r\\nthat I might consider myself fuel. When I became Joe's 'prentice, Orlick\\r\\nwas perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace him;\\r\\nhowbeit, he liked me still less. Not that he ever said anything, or did\\r\\nanything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that he always beat\\r\\nhis sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang Old Clem, he came\\r\\nin out of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Joe of\\r\\nmy half-holiday. He said nothing at the moment, for he and Joe had just\\r\\ngot a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows; but by\\r\\nand by he said, leaning on his hammer,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, master! Sure you're not a going to favor only one of us. If Young\\r\\nPip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I suppose he was\\r\\nabout five-and-twenty, but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient\\r\\nperson.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, what'll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat'll I do with it! What'll he do with it? I'll do as much with it as\\r\\nhim,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Orlick.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs to Pip, he's going up town,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell then, as to Old Orlick, he's a going up town,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d retorted that\\r\\nworthy. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTwo can go up town. Tain't only one wot can go up town.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDon't lose your temper,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShall if I like,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d growled Orlick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSome and their uptowning! Now,\\r\\nmaster! Come. No favoring in this shop. Be a man!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in\\r\\na better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a red-hot\\r\\nbar, made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body,\\r\\nwhisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out,--as\\r\\nif it were I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood,--and\\r\\nfinally said, when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold, and he\\r\\nagain leaned on his hammer,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, master!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you all right now?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d demanded Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh! I am all right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said gruff Old Orlick.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nJoe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9clet it be a half-holiday for all.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sister had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing,--she was\\r\\na most unscrupulous spy and listener,--and she instantly looked in at\\r\\none of the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLike you, you fool!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she to Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cgiving holidays to great idle\\r\\nhulkers like that. You are a rich man, upon my life, to waste wages in\\r\\nthat way. I wish I was his master!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou'd be everybody's master, if you durst,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d retorted Orlick, with an\\r\\nill-favored grin.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet her alone,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.)\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI'd be a match for all noodles and all rogues,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned my sister,\\r\\nbeginning to work herself into a mighty rage. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd I couldn't be a\\r\\nmatch for the noodles, without being a match for your master, who's the\\r\\ndunder-headed king of the noodles. And I couldn't be a match for the\\r\\nrogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackest-looking and\\r\\nthe worst rogue between this and France. Now!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou're a foul shrew, Mother Gargery,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d growled the journeyman. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf that\\r\\nmakes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good'un.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n(Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet her alone, will you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.)\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat did you say?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried my sister, beginning to scream. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat did you\\r\\nsay? What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip? What did he call me,\\r\\nwith my husband standing by? Oh! oh! oh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Each of these exclamations was\\r\\na shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true of all\\r\\nthe violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for\\r\\nher, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, she\\r\\nconsciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself\\r\\ninto it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat was the\\r\\nname he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me? Oh! Hold me!\\r\\nOh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh-h-h!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d growled the journeyman, between his teeth, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'd hold you, if\\r\\nyou was my wife. I'd hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n(Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI tell you, let her alone,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.)\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh! To hear him!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried my sister, with a clap of her hands and a\\r\\nscream together,--which was her next stage. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTo hear the names he's\\r\\ngiving me! That Orlick! In my own house! Me, a married woman! With my\\r\\nhusband standing by! Oh! Oh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Here my sister, after a fit of clappings\\r\\nand screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees, and\\r\\nthrew her cap off, and pulled her hair down,--which were the last stages\\r\\non her road to frenzy. Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete\\r\\nsuccess, she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical\\r\\ninterruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what he meant\\r\\nby interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whether he was\\r\\nman enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situation admitted of\\r\\nnothing less than coming on, and was on his defence straightway; so,\\r\\nwithout so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons, they went\\r\\nat one another, like two giants. But, if any man in that neighborhood\\r\\ncould stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man. Orlick, as if he\\r\\nhad been of no more account than the pale young gentleman, was very\\r\\nsoon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to come out of it. Then Joe\\r\\nunlocked the door and picked up my sister, who had dropped insensible\\r\\nat the window (but who had seen the fight first, I think), and who was\\r\\ncarried into the house and laid down, and who was recommended to revive,\\r\\nand would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in Joe's hair.\\r\\nThen came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars; and\\r\\nthen, with the vague sensation which I have always connected with such\\r\\na lull,--namely, that it was Sunday, and somebody was dead,--I went upstairs\\r\\nto dress myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without any\\r\\nother traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick's nostrils,\\r\\nwhich was neither expressive nor ornamental. A pot of beer had appeared\\r\\nfrom the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in a\\r\\npeaceable manner. The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on\\r\\nJoe, who followed me out into the road to say, as a parting observation\\r\\nthat might do me good, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOn the Rampage, Pip, and off the Rampage,\\r\\nPip:--such is Life!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith what absurd emotions (for we think the feelings that are very\\r\\nserious in a man quite comical in a boy) I found myself again going to\\r\\nMiss Havisham's, matters little here. Nor, how I passed and repassed\\r\\nthe gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring. Nor, how\\r\\nI debated whether I should go away without ringing; nor, how I should\\r\\nundoubtedly have gone, if my time had been my own, to come back.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Sarah Pocket came to the gate. No Estella.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow, then? You here again?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Pocket. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you want?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was, Sarah\\r\\nevidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my\\r\\nbusiness. But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me in, and\\r\\npresently brought the sharp message that I was to Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccome up.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she, fixing her eyes upon me. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI hope you want nothing?\\r\\nYou'll get nothing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo indeed, Miss Havisham. I only wanted you to know that I am doing\\r\\nvery well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere, there!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d with the old restless fingers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome now and then; come\\r\\non your birthday.--Ay!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she cried suddenly, turning herself and her\\r\\nchair towards me, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou are looking round for Estella? Hey?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been looking round,--in fact, for Estella,--and I stammered that I\\r\\nhoped she was well.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAbroad,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham; Ã¢\\x80\\x9ceducating for a lady; far out of reach;\\r\\nprettier than ever; admired by all who see her. Do you feel that you\\r\\nhave lost her?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last words,\\r\\nand she broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a loss what\\r\\nto say. She spared me the trouble of considering, by dismissing me. When\\r\\nthe gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the walnut-shell countenance, I\\r\\nfelt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with\\r\\neverything; and that was all I took by that motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately at\\r\\nthe shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman,\\r\\nwho should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle. Mr. Wopsle had in\\r\\nhis hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he had that\\r\\nmoment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on\\r\\nthe head of Pumblechook, with whom he was going to drink tea. No sooner\\r\\ndid he see me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providence\\r\\nhad put a 'prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me,\\r\\nand insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlor. As I\\r\\nknew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the\\r\\nway was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better\\r\\nthan none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned into\\r\\nPumblechook's just as the street and the shops were lighting up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I\\r\\ndon't know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it\\r\\ntook until half-past nine o' clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopsle\\r\\ngot into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, he became\\r\\nso much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful career. I\\r\\nthought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short\\r\\nin his flower after all, as if he had not been running to seed, leaf\\r\\nafter leaf, ever since his course began. This, however, was a\\r\\nmere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the\\r\\nidentification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. When\\r\\nBarnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively apologetic,\\r\\nPumblechook's indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle, too, took\\r\\npains to present me in the worst light. At once ferocious and maudlin, I\\r\\nwas made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever;\\r\\nMillwood put me down in argument, on every occasion; it became sheer\\r\\nmonomania in my master's daughter to care a button for me; and all I can\\r\\nsay for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning, is,\\r\\nthat it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character. Even after\\r\\nI was happily hanged and Wopsle had closed the book, Pumblechook sat\\r\\nstaring at me, and shaking his head, and saying, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTake warning, boy,\\r\\ntake warning!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d as if it were a well-known fact that I contemplated\\r\\nmurdering a near relation, provided I could only induce one to have the\\r\\nweakness to become my benefactor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with\\r\\nMr. Wopsle on the walk home. Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out, and\\r\\nit fell wet and thick. The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of the\\r\\nlamp's usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance on\\r\\nthe fog. We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose with a\\r\\nchange of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we came upon\\r\\na man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHalloa!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d we said, stopping. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOrlick there?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he answered, slouching out. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI was standing by a minute, on the\\r\\nchance of company.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are late,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrlick not unnaturally answered, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell? And you're late.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe have been,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe\\r\\nhave been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we all\\r\\nwent on together. I asked him presently whether he had been spending his\\r\\nhalf-holiday up and down town?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9call of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn't see you,\\r\\nbut I must have been pretty close behind you. By the by, the guns is\\r\\ngoing again.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt the Hulks?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAy! There's some of the birds flown from the cages. The guns have been\\r\\ngoing since dark, about. You'll hear one presently.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the\\r\\nwell-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily\\r\\nrolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing\\r\\nand threatening the fugitives.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA good night for cutting off in,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Orlick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe'd be puzzled how to\\r\\nbring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in\\r\\nsilence. Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening's tragedy,\\r\\nfell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell. Orlick, with his\\r\\nhands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was very dark,\\r\\nvery wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, the sound\\r\\nof the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled sulkily along\\r\\nthe course of the river. I kept myself to myself and my thoughts. Mr.\\r\\nWopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game on Bosworth\\r\\nField, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury. Orlick sometimes\\r\\ngrowled, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBeat it out, beat it out,--Old Clem! With a clink for the\\r\\nstout,--Old Clem!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I thought he had been drinking, but he was not drunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it took us\\r\\npast the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find--it being\\r\\neleven o'clock--in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and\\r\\nunwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered\\r\\nabout. Mr. Wopsle dropped into ask what was the matter (surmising that\\r\\na convict had been taken), but came running out in a great hurry.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere's something wrong,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, without stopping, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cup at your place,\\r\\nPip. Run all!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked, keeping up with him. So did Orlick, at my side.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI can't quite understand. The house seems to have been violently\\r\\nentered when Joe Gargery was out. Supposed by convicts. Somebody has\\r\\nbeen attacked and hurt.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made no\\r\\nstop until we got into our kitchen. It was full of people; the whole\\r\\nvillage was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there\\r\\nwas Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midst\\r\\nof the kitchen. The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me,\\r\\nand so I became aware of my sister,--lying without sense or movement on\\r\\nthe bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow\\r\\non the back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face was\\r\\nturned towards the fire,--destined never to be on the Rampage again,\\r\\nwhile she was the wife of Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XVI\\r\\n\\r\\nWith my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to believe\\r\\nthat I must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister, or at\\r\\nall events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under\\r\\nobligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than\\r\\nany one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began to\\r\\nreconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides, I\\r\\ntook another view of the case, which was more reasonable.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from a\\r\\nquarter after eight o'clock to a quarter before ten. While he was there,\\r\\nmy sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had exchanged\\r\\nGood Night with a farm-laborer going home. The man could not be more\\r\\nparticular as to the time at which he saw her (he got into dense\\r\\nconfusion when he tried to be), than that it must have been before nine.\\r\\nWhen Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he found her struck down\\r\\non the floor, and promptly called in assistance. The fire had not then\\r\\nburnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle very long; the\\r\\ncandle, however, had been blown out.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond\\r\\nthe blowing out of the candle,--which stood on a table between the door\\r\\nand my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was\\r\\nstruck,--was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such\\r\\nas she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one\\r\\nremarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck with\\r\\nsomething blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were\\r\\ndealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable\\r\\nviolence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, when Joe\\r\\npicked her up, was a convict's leg-iron which had been filed asunder.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Joe, examining this iron with a smith's eye, declared it to have\\r\\nbeen filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the\\r\\nHulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe's opinion\\r\\nwas corroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left the\\r\\nprison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they claimed\\r\\nto know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by\\r\\neither of the two convicts who had escaped last night. Further, one of\\r\\nthose two was already retaken, and had not freed himself of his iron.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed\\r\\nthe iron to be my convict's iron,--the iron I had seen and heard him\\r\\nfiling at, on the marshes,--but my mind did not accuse him of having put\\r\\nit to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to have\\r\\nbecome possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.\\r\\nEither Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we\\r\\npicked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all the\\r\\nevening, he had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and\\r\\nhe had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle. There was nothing against\\r\\nhim, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and with\\r\\neverybody else about her, ten thousand times. As to the strange man; if\\r\\nhe had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no dispute\\r\\nabout them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore them.\\r\\nBesides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in so\\r\\nsilently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she could look\\r\\nround.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however\\r\\nundesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered unspeakable\\r\\ntrouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I should at last\\r\\ndissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the story. For\\r\\nmonths afterwards, I every day settled the question finally in the\\r\\nnegative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. The contention\\r\\ncame, after all, to this;--the secret was such an old one now, had so\\r\\ngrown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not tear it\\r\\naway. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much mischief,\\r\\nit would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me if he\\r\\nbelieved it, I had a further restraining dread that he would not believe\\r\\nit, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets as a\\r\\nmonstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, of course--for,\\r\\nwas I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing is always\\r\\ndone?--and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see any\\r\\nsuch new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the\\r\\nassailant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constables and the Bow Street men from London--for, this happened in\\r\\nthe days of the extinct red-waistcoated police--were about the house for\\r\\na week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like\\r\\nauthorities doing in other such cases. They took up several obviously\\r\\nwrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas,\\r\\nand persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead\\r\\nof trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stood\\r\\nabout the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks\\r\\nthat filled the whole neighborhood with admiration; and they had a\\r\\nmysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as\\r\\ntaking the culprit. But not quite, for they never did it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay very\\r\\nill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects multiplied,\\r\\nand grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the\\r\\nrealities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and her\\r\\nspeech was unintelligible. When, at last, she came round so far as to\\r\\nbe helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always by\\r\\nher, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in\\r\\nspeech. As she was (very bad handwriting apart) a more than indifferent\\r\\nspeller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader, extraordinary\\r\\ncomplications arose between them which I was always called in to solve.\\r\\nThe administration of mutton instead of medicine, the substitution of\\r\\nTea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among the mildest of my own\\r\\nmistakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient. A\\r\\ntremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a\\r\\npart of her regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three\\r\\nmonths, she would often put her hands to her head, and would then remain\\r\\nfor about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind. We were\\r\\nat a loss to find a suitable attendant for her, until a circumstance\\r\\nhappened conveniently to relieve us. Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt conquered a\\r\\nconfirmed habit of living into which she had fallen, and Biddy became a\\r\\npart of our establishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may have been about a month after my sister's reappearance in the\\r\\nkitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the\\r\\nwhole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.\\r\\nAbove all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly\\r\\ncut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had\\r\\nbeen accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me\\r\\nevery now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSuch a fine\\r\\nfigure of a woman as she once were, Pip!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Biddy instantly taking the\\r\\ncleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joe\\r\\nbecame able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life,\\r\\nand to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that did\\r\\nhim good. It was characteristic of the police people that they had all\\r\\nmore or less suspected poor Joe (though he never knew it), and that they\\r\\nhad to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits\\r\\nthey had ever encountered.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiddy's first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty\\r\\nthat had completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had made\\r\\nnothing of it. Thus it was:--\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a\\r\\ncharacter that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost\\r\\neagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly\\r\\nwanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,\\r\\nfrom tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the\\r\\nsign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my\\r\\nsister's ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a\\r\\nqualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one after\\r\\nanother, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the shape\\r\\nbeing much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and displayed\\r\\nit to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shook her head to\\r\\nthat extent when she was shown it, that we were terrified lest in her\\r\\nweak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this\\r\\nmysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully\\r\\nat it, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked\\r\\nthoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his\\r\\ninitial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, of course!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Biddy, with an exultant face. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDon't you see?\\r\\nIt's him!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOrlick, without a doubt! She had lost his name, and could only signify\\r\\nhim by his hammer. We told him why we wanted him to come into the\\r\\nkitchen, and he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his brow with his\\r\\narm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching\\r\\nout, with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly\\r\\ndistinguished him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him, and that I\\r\\nwas disappointed by the different result. She manifested the greatest\\r\\nanxiety to be on good terms with him, was evidently much pleased by his\\r\\nbeing at length produced, and motioned that she would have him\\r\\ngiven something to drink. She watched his countenance as if she were\\r\\nparticularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception,\\r\\nshe showed every possible desire to conciliate him, and there was an air\\r\\nof humble propitiation in all she did, such as I have seen pervade the\\r\\nbearing of a child towards a hard master. After that day, a day rarely\\r\\npassed without her drawing the hammer on her slate, and without Orlick's\\r\\nslouching in and standing doggedly before her, as if he knew no more\\r\\nthan I did what to make of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XVII\\r\\n\\r\\nI now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which was\\r\\nvaried beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more\\r\\nremarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying\\r\\nanother visit to Miss Havisham. I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty\\r\\nat the gate; I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her, and she spoke\\r\\nof Estella in the very same way, if not in the very same words. The\\r\\ninterview lasted but a few minutes, and she gave me a guinea when I was\\r\\ngoing, and told me to come again on my next birthday. I may mention at\\r\\nonce that this became an annual custom. I tried to decline taking the\\r\\nguinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than causing her\\r\\nto ask me very angrily, if I expected more? Then, and after that, I took\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened\\r\\nroom, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, that\\r\\nI felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that\\r\\nmysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grew\\r\\nolder, it stood still. Daylight never entered the house as to my\\r\\nthoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact. It\\r\\nbewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hate my\\r\\ntrade and to be ashamed of home.\\r\\n\\r\\nImperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however. Her\\r\\nshoes came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her hands were\\r\\nalways clean. She was not beautiful,--she was common, and could not be\\r\\nlike Estella,--but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered.\\r\\nShe had not been with us more than a year (I remember her being newly\\r\\nout of mourning at the time it struck me), when I observed to myself one\\r\\nevening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyes that\\r\\nwere very pretty and very good.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring\\r\\nat--writing some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at\\r\\nonce by a sort of stratagem--and seeing Biddy observant of what I was\\r\\nabout. I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework without\\r\\nlaying it down.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you\\r\\nare very clever.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is it that I manage? I don't know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Biddy, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not\\r\\nmean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow do you manage, Biddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto learn everything that I learn,\\r\\nand always to keep up with me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I was beginning to be rather vain of\\r\\nmy knowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the\\r\\ngreater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have no\\r\\ndoubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI might as well ask you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow you manage?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see\\r\\nme turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose I must catch it like a cough,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy, quietly; and went\\r\\non with her sewing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at\\r\\nBiddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her rather\\r\\nan extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that she was equally\\r\\naccomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our different\\r\\nsorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I knew, Biddy\\r\\nknew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith as I, or\\r\\nbetter.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are one of those, Biddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwho make the most of every\\r\\nchance. You never had a chance before you came here, and see how\\r\\nimproved you are!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBiddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI was\\r\\nyour first teacher though; wasn't I?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she, as she sewed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed, in amazement. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, you are crying!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo I am not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy, looking up and laughing. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat put that in\\r\\nyour head?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it\\r\\ndropped on her work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had been\\r\\nuntil Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of\\r\\nliving, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled\\r\\nthe hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the\\r\\nmiserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school,\\r\\nwith that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and\\r\\nshouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must\\r\\nhave been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first\\r\\nuneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of\\r\\ncourse. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I\\r\\nlooked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps\\r\\nI had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too\\r\\nreserved, and should have patronized her more (though I did not use that\\r\\nprecise word in my meditations) with my confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Biddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I observed, when I had done turning it over, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou were my\\r\\nfirst teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being\\r\\ntogether like this, in this kitchen.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, poor thing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied Biddy. It was like her self-forgetfulness to\\r\\ntransfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her,\\r\\nmaking her more comfortable; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat's sadly true!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe must talk together a little more, as we used to do.\\r\\nAnd I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have a\\r\\nquiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertook\\r\\nthe care of her on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out\\r\\ntogether. It was summer-time, and lovely weather. When we had passed the\\r\\nvillage and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the marshes\\r\\nand began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I began to\\r\\ncombine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in my usual way.\\r\\nWhen we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank, with the water\\r\\nrippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than it would have been\\r\\nwithout that sound, I resolved that it was a good time and place for the\\r\\nadmission of Biddy into my inner confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, after binding her to secrecy, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI want to be a\\r\\ngentleman.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO, I wouldn't, if I was you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she returned. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't think it would\\r\\nanswer.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, with some severity, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have particular reasons for\\r\\nwanting to be a gentleman.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know best, Pip; but don't you think you are happier as you are?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed, impatiently, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am not at all happy as I am. I\\r\\nam disgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken to\\r\\neither, since I was bound. Don't be absurd.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWas I absurd?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am sorry\\r\\nfor that; I didn't mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to be\\r\\ncomfortable.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be\\r\\ncomfortable--or anything but miserable--there, Biddy!--unless I can lead\\r\\na very different sort of life from the life I lead now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's a pity!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy, shaking her head with a sorrowful air.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind of\\r\\nquarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half inclined\\r\\nto shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to her\\r\\nsentiment and my own. I told her she was right, and I knew it was much\\r\\nto be regretted, but still it was not to be helped.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf I could have settled down,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I said to Biddy, plucking up the short\\r\\ngrass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings\\r\\nout of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif I could have\\r\\nsettled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was\\r\\nlittle, I know it would have been much better for me. You and I and Joe\\r\\nwould have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gone\\r\\npartners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up to\\r\\nkeep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine\\r\\nSunday, quite different people. I should have been good enough for you;\\r\\nshouldn't I, Biddy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBiddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for\\r\\nanswer, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes; I am not over-particular.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d It scarcely sounded flattering,\\r\\nbut I knew she meant well.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cInstead of that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or\\r\\ntwo, Ã¢\\x80\\x9csee how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, and--what\\r\\nwould it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had told me\\r\\nso!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBiddy turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more\\r\\nattentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nremarked, directing her eyes to the ships again. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWho said it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where\\r\\nI was going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I\\r\\nanswered, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's, and she's more\\r\\nbeautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and I want\\r\\nto be a gentleman on her account.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Having made this lunatic confession,\\r\\nI began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I had some\\r\\nthoughts of following it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Biddy\\r\\nquietly asked me, after a pause.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I moodily answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause, if it is to spite her,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Biddy pursued, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should think--but\\r\\nyou know best--that might be better and more independently done by\\r\\ncaring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should\\r\\nthink--but you know best--she was not worth gaining over.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nExactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was\\r\\nperfectly manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazed\\r\\nvillage lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and\\r\\nwisest of men fall every day?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt may be all quite true,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I to Biddy, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I admire her\\r\\ndreadfully.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good\\r\\ngrasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well. All the\\r\\nwhile knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced,\\r\\nthat I was quite conscious it would have served my face right, if I\\r\\nhad lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the pebbles as a\\r\\npunishment for belonging to such an idiot.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with me.\\r\\nShe put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work,\\r\\nupon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of my hair.\\r\\nThen she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while with my face\\r\\nupon my sleeve I cried a little,--exactly as I had done in the brewery\\r\\nyard,--and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-used by\\r\\nsomebody, or by everybody; I can't say which.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am glad of one thing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand that is, that you have felt\\r\\nyou could give me your confidence, Pip. And I am glad of another thing,\\r\\nand that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it\\r\\nand always so far deserving it. If your first teacher (dear! such a poor\\r\\none, and so much in need of being taught herself!) had been your teacher\\r\\nat the present time, she thinks she knows what lesson she would set. But\\r\\nit would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her, and it's\\r\\nof no use now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from the bank,\\r\\nand said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShall we walk a\\r\\nlittle farther, or go home?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and giving\\r\\nher a kiss, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI shall always tell you everything.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTill you're a gentleman,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know I never shall be, so that's always. Not that I have any\\r\\noccasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,--as I\\r\\ntold you at home the other night.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships.\\r\\nAnd then repeated, with her former pleasant change, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cshall we walk a\\r\\nlittle farther, or go home?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the\\r\\nsummer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very\\r\\nbeautiful. I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and\\r\\nwholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing\\r\\nbeggar my neighbor by candle-light in the room with the stopped clocks,\\r\\nand being despised by Estella. I thought it would be very good for me if\\r\\nI could get her out of my head, with all the rest of those remembrances\\r\\nand fancies, and could go to work determined to relish what I had to do,\\r\\nand stick to it, and make the best of it. I asked myself the question\\r\\nwhether I did not surely know that if Estella were beside me at that\\r\\nmoment instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable? I was obliged to\\r\\nadmit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said to myself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPip,\\r\\nwhat a fool you are!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed\\r\\nright. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and\\r\\nsomebody else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain, and no\\r\\npleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded her own\\r\\nbreast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like her much\\r\\nthe better of the two?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, when we were walking homeward, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wish you could put me\\r\\nright.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wish I could!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf I could only get myself to fall in love with you,--you don't mind my\\r\\nspeaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh dear, not at all!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDon't mind me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf I could only get myself to do it, that would be the thing for me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut you never will, you see,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it would have\\r\\ndone if we had discussed it a few hours before. I therefore observed\\r\\nI was not quite sure of that. But Biddy said she was, and she said it\\r\\ndecisively. In my heart I believed her to be right; and yet I took it\\r\\nrather ill, too, that she should be so positive on the point.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and\\r\\nget over a stile near a sluice-gate. There started up, from the gate, or\\r\\nfrom the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnant way),\\r\\nOld Orlick.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHalloa!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he growled, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhere are you two going?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhere should we be going, but home?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'm jiggered if I don't see you home!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of\\r\\nhis. He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of, but\\r\\nused it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind, and\\r\\nconvey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger, I\\r\\nhad had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he would\\r\\nhave done it with a sharp and twisted hook.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDon't let him come; I don't like him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d As I did not like him either,\\r\\nI took the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn't want\\r\\nseeing home. He received that piece of information with a yell of\\r\\nlaughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little\\r\\ndistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in\\r\\nthat murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any\\r\\naccount, I asked her why she did not like him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cbecause I--I am afraid he likes me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid he ever tell you he liked you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked indignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, Ã¢\\x80\\x9che never told me\\r\\nso; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not\\r\\ndoubt the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed upon\\r\\nOld Orlick's daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage on\\r\\nmyself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut it makes no difference to you, you know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy, calmly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don't like it; I don't\\r\\napprove of it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNor I neither,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThough that makes no difference to you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cExactly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I must tell you I should have no opinion of you,\\r\\nBiddy, if he danced at you with your own consent.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances\\r\\nwere favorable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure that\\r\\ndemonstration. He had struck root in Joe's establishment, by reason\\r\\nof my sister's sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get him\\r\\ndismissed. He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as I\\r\\nhad reason to know thereafter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated\\r\\nits confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I\\r\\nwas clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the\\r\\nplain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to\\r\\nbe ashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect\\r\\nand happiness. At those times, I would decide conclusively that my\\r\\ndisaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I was\\r\\ngrowing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company\\r\\nwith Biddy,--when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the\\r\\nHavisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and scatter\\r\\nmy wits again. Scattered wits take a long time picking up; and often\\r\\nbefore I had got them well together, they would be dispersed in all\\r\\ndirections by one stray thought, that perhaps after all Miss Havisham\\r\\nwas going to make my fortune when my time was out.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of my\\r\\nperplexities, I dare say. It never did run out, however, but was brought\\r\\nto a premature end, as I proceed to relate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and it was a\\r\\nSaturday night. There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three\\r\\nJolly Bargemen, attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud.\\r\\nOf that group I was one.\\r\\n\\r\\nA highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle was imbrued\\r\\nin blood to the eyebrows. He gloated over every abhorrent adjective\\r\\nin the description, and identified himself with every witness at the\\r\\nInquest. He faintly moaned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am done for,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d as the victim, and he\\r\\nbarbarously bellowed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'll serve you out,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d as the murderer. He gave the\\r\\nmedical testimony, in pointed imitation of our local practitioner; and\\r\\nhe piped and shook, as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heard blows, to\\r\\nan extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental\\r\\ncompetency of that witness. The coroner, in Mr. Wopsle's hands, became\\r\\nTimon of Athens; the beadle, Coriolanus. He enjoyed himself thoroughly,\\r\\nand we all enjoyed ourselves, and were delightfully comfortable. In this\\r\\ncosey state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful Murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over\\r\\nthe back of the settle opposite me, looking on. There was an expression\\r\\nof contempt on his face, and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he\\r\\nwatched the group of faces.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou\\r\\nhave settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer. He looked\\r\\nat everybody coldly and sarcastically.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGuilty, of course?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOut with it. Come!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Wopsle, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwithout having the honor of your\\r\\nacquaintance, I do say Guilty.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Upon this we all took courage to unite\\r\\nin a confirmatory murmur.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI know you do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the stranger; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI knew you would. I told you so.\\r\\nBut now I'll ask you a question. Do you know, or do you not know,\\r\\nthat the law of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he is\\r\\nproved--proved--to be guilty?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Wopsle began to reply, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas an Englishman myself, I--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCome!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the stranger, biting his forefinger at him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDon't evade\\r\\nthe question. Either you know it, or you don't know it. Which is it to\\r\\nbe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood with his head on one side and himself on one side, in a\\r\\nbullying, interrogative manner, and he threw his forefinger at Mr.\\r\\nWopsle,--as it were to mark him out--before biting it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo you know it, or don't you know it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCertainly I know it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Wopsle.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCertainly you know it. Then why didn't you say so at first? Now, I'll\\r\\nask you another question,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d--taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if he\\r\\nhad a right to him,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdo you know that none of these witnesses have yet\\r\\nbeen cross-examined?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wopsle was beginning, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI can only say--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d when the stranger stopped\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat? You won't answer the question, yes or no? Now, I'll try you\\r\\nagain.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Throwing his finger at him again. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAttend to me. Are you\\r\\naware, or are you not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet been\\r\\ncross-examined? Come, I only want one word from you. Yes, or no?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion\\r\\nof him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCome!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the stranger, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'll help you. You don't deserve help, but\\r\\nI'll help you. Look at that paper you hold in your hand. What is it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious\\r\\nmanner, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe printed paper you have just been reading from?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUndoubtedly.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUndoubtedly. Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it distinctly\\r\\nstates that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers\\r\\ninstructed him altogether to reserve his defence?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI read that just now,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Wopsle pleaded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNever mind what you read just now, sir; I don't ask you what you read\\r\\njust now. You may read the Lord's Prayer backwards, if you like,--and,\\r\\nperhaps, have done it before to-day. Turn to the paper. No, no, no my\\r\\nfriend; not to the top of the column; you know better than that; to\\r\\nthe bottom, to the bottom.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of\\r\\nsubterfuge.) Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell? Have you found it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHere it is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wopsle.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it\\r\\ndistinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was\\r\\ninstructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence? Come! Do\\r\\nyou make that of it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wopsle answered, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThose are not the exact words.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot the exact words!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated the gentleman bitterly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIs that the\\r\\nexact substance?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wopsle.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company\\r\\nwith his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd now I ask\\r\\nyou what you say to the conscience of that man who, with that passage\\r\\nbefore his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow after having\\r\\npronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought\\r\\nhim, and that he was beginning to be found out.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd that same man, remember,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pursued the gentleman, throwing his\\r\\nfinger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat same man might be summoned as a\\r\\njuryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed himself,\\r\\nmight return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his\\r\\npillow, after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the\\r\\nissue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the\\r\\nbar, and would a true verdict give according to the evidence, so help\\r\\nhim God!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too\\r\\nfar, and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and\\r\\nwith a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of\\r\\nus that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose\\r\\nit, left the back of the settle, and came into the space between the two\\r\\nsettles, in front of the fire, where he remained standing, his left hand\\r\\nin his pocket, and he biting the forefinger of his right.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFrom information I have received,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, looking round at us as we\\r\\nall quailed before him, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have reason to believe there is a blacksmith\\r\\namong you, by name Joseph--or Joe--Gargery. Which is the man?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHere is the man,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place, and Joe went.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou have an apprentice,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pursued the stranger, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccommonly known as Pip?\\r\\nIs he here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am here!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stranger did not recognize me, but I recognized him as the gentleman\\r\\nI had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit to Miss\\r\\nHavisham. I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the settle,\\r\\nand now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder,\\r\\nI checked off again in detail his large head, his dark complexion, his\\r\\ndeep-set eyes, his bushy black eyebrows, his large watch-chain, his\\r\\nstrong black dots of beard and whisker, and even the smell of scented\\r\\nsoap on his great hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wish to have a private conference with you two,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, when he had\\r\\nsurveyed me at his leisure. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt will take a little time. Perhaps we\\r\\nhad better go to your place of residence. I prefer not to anticipate my\\r\\ncommunication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as you\\r\\nplease to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAmidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen,\\r\\nand in a wondering silence walked home. While going along, the strange\\r\\ngentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of\\r\\nhis finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as\\r\\nan impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front door.\\r\\nOur conference was held in the state parlor, which was feebly lighted by\\r\\none candle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt began with the strange gentleman's sitting down at the table, drawing\\r\\nthe candle to him, and looking over some entries in his pocket-book.\\r\\nHe then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little aside, after\\r\\npeering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to ascertain which was\\r\\nwhich.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy name,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I am\\r\\npretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and I\\r\\ncommence by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my advice\\r\\nhad been asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked, and you\\r\\nsee me here. What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I\\r\\ndo. No less, no more.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFinding that he could not see us very well from where he sat, he got\\r\\nup, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thus\\r\\nhaving one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of\\r\\nthis young fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel his\\r\\nindentures at his request and for his good? You would want nothing for\\r\\nso doing?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip's way,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Joe, staring.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Mr.\\r\\nJaggers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe question is, Would you want anything? Do you want\\r\\nanything?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe answer is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Joe, sternly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool for\\r\\nhis disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between breathless\\r\\ncuriosity and surprise, to be sure of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery well,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cRecollect the admission you have made,\\r\\nand don't try to go from it presently.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWho's a going to try?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d retorted Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I do keep a dog.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.\\r\\nBear that in mind, will you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyes\\r\\nand nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got to\\r\\nmake is, that he has great expectations.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe and I gasped, and looked at one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am instructed to communicate to him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, throwing\\r\\nhis finger at me sideways, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat he will come into a handsome property.\\r\\nFurther, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that\\r\\nproperty, that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life\\r\\nand from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,--in a word, as a\\r\\nyoung fellow of great expectations.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; Miss\\r\\nHavisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Mr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pursued the lawyer, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI address the rest of what I have\\r\\nto say, to you. You are to understand, first, that it is the request\\r\\nof the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear\\r\\nthe name of Pip. You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great\\r\\nexpectations being encumbered with that easy condition. But if you have\\r\\nany objection, this is the time to mention it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears,\\r\\nthat I could scarcely stammer I had no objection.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should think not! Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, that\\r\\nthe name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound\\r\\nsecret, until the person chooses to reveal it. I am empowered to mention\\r\\nthat it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by\\r\\nword of mouth to yourself. When or where that intention may be carried\\r\\nout, I cannot say; no one can say. It may be years hence. Now, you are\\r\\ndistinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from\\r\\nmaking any inquiry on this head, or any allusion or reference, however\\r\\ndistant, to any individual whomsoever as the individual, in all the\\r\\ncommunications you may have with me. If you have a suspicion in your own\\r\\nbreast, keep that suspicion in your own breast. It is not the least to\\r\\nthe purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are; they may be the\\r\\nstrongest and gravest reasons, or they may be mere whim. This is not for\\r\\nyou to inquire into. The condition is laid down. Your acceptance of it,\\r\\nand your observance of it as binding, is the only remaining condition\\r\\nthat I am charged with, by the person from whom I take my instructions,\\r\\nand for whom I am not otherwise responsible. That person is the person\\r\\nfrom whom you derive your expectations, and the secret is solely held by\\r\\nthat person and by me. Again, not a very difficult condition with which\\r\\nto encumber such a rise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it,\\r\\nthis is the time to mention it. Speak out.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should think not! Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Though he called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, he still\\r\\ncould not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; and even now\\r\\nhe occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he\\r\\nspoke, as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my\\r\\ndisparagement, if he only chose to mention them. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe come next, to mere\\r\\ndetails of arrangement. You must know that, although I have used\\r\\nthe term 'expectations' more than once, you are not endowed with\\r\\nexpectations only. There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money\\r\\namply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance. You will\\r\\nplease consider me your guardian. Oh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d for I was going to thank him, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\ntell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldn't render them.\\r\\nIt is considered that you must be better educated, in accordance with\\r\\nyour altered position, and that you will be alive to the importance and\\r\\nnecessity of at once entering on that advantage.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI said I had always longed for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNever mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he retorted;\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9ckeep to the record. If you long for it now, that's enough. Am I\\r\\nanswered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper\\r\\ntutor? Is that it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI stammered yes, that was it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood. Now, your inclinations are to be consulted. I don't think that\\r\\nwise, mind, but it's my trust. Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you\\r\\nwould prefer to another?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt;\\r\\nso, I replied in the negative.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I think\\r\\nmight suit the purpose,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't recommend him,\\r\\nobserve; because I never recommend anybody. The gentleman I speak of is\\r\\none Mr. Matthew Pocket.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! I caught at the name directly. Miss Havisham's relation. The Matthew\\r\\nwhom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of. The Matthew whose place was to\\r\\nbe at Miss Havisham's head, when she lay dead, in her bride's dress on\\r\\nthe bride's table.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know the name?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me, and then\\r\\nshutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy answer was, that I had heard of the name.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou have heard of the name. But the question is, what do\\r\\nyou say of it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to him for his\\r\\nrecommendation--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, my young friend!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he interrupted, shaking his great head very\\r\\nslowly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cRecollect yourself!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNot recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to him\\r\\nfor his recommendation--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, my young friend,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he interrupted, shaking his head and frowning and\\r\\nsmiling both at once,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cno, no, no; it's very well done, but it won't\\r\\ndo; you are too young to fix me with it. Recommendation is not the word,\\r\\nMr. Pip. Try another.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrecting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him for his mention\\r\\nof Mr. Matthew Pocket--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's more like it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Jaggers.--And (I added), I would\\r\\ngladly try that gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood. You had better try him in his own house. The way shall be\\r\\nprepared for you, and you can see his son first, who is in London. When\\r\\nwill you come to London?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI said (glancing at Joe, who stood looking on, motionless), that I\\r\\nsupposed I could come directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFirst,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou should have some new clothes to come in,\\r\\nand they should not be working-clothes. Say this day week. You'll want\\r\\nsome money. Shall I leave you twenty guineas?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted them\\r\\nout on the table and pushed them over to me. This was the first time he\\r\\nhad taken his leg from the chair. He sat astride of the chair when he\\r\\nhad pushed the money over, and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Joseph Gargery? You look dumbfoundered?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, in a very decided manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt were understood,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd it are understood. And it ever will\\r\\nbe similar according.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut what,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his purse,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat if it was in my\\r\\ninstructions to make you a present, as compensation?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs compensation what for?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFor the loss of his services.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman. I have\\r\\noften thought him since, like the steam-hammer that can crush a man or\\r\\npat an egg-shell, in his combination of strength with gentleness. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPip\\r\\nis that hearty welcome,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto go free with his services, to\\r\\nhonor and fortun', as no words can tell him. But if you think as Money\\r\\ncan make compensation to me for the loss of the little child--what come\\r\\nto the forge--and ever the best of friends!--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nO dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I\\r\\nsee you again, with your muscular blacksmith's arm before your eyes,\\r\\nand your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away. O dear good\\r\\nfaithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm,\\r\\nas solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel's wing!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I encouraged Joe at the time. I was lost in the mazes of my future\\r\\nfortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together. I\\r\\nbegged Joe to be comforted, for (as he said) we had ever been the best\\r\\nof friends, and (as I said) we ever would be so. Joe scooped his eyes\\r\\nwith his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on gouging himself, but\\r\\nsaid not another word.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognized in Joe the\\r\\nvillage idiot, and in me his keeper. When it was over, he said, weighing\\r\\nin his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No half\\r\\nmeasures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it in charge\\r\\nto make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on the contrary you\\r\\nmean to say--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Here, to his great amazement, he was stopped by Joe's\\r\\nsuddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic\\r\\npurpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich I meantersay,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat if you come into my place\\r\\nbull-baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as sech if\\r\\nyou're a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay\\r\\nand stand or fall by!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely stating to\\r\\nme, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any\\r\\none whom it might happen to concern, that he were not a going to be\\r\\nbull-baited and badgered in his own place. Mr. Jaggers had risen when\\r\\nJoe demonstrated, and had backed near the door. Without evincing\\r\\nany inclination to come in again, he there delivered his valedictory\\r\\nremarks. They were these.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here--as you are to be a\\r\\ngentleman--the better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shall\\r\\nreceive my printed address in the meantime. You can take a hackney-coach\\r\\nat the stage-coach office in London, and come straight to me.\\r\\nUnderstand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the trust\\r\\nI undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so. Now, understand\\r\\nthat, finally. Understand that!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have gone\\r\\non, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething came into my head which induced me to run after him, as he was\\r\\ngoing down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he had left a hired carriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHalloa!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, facing round, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat's the matter?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions;\\r\\nso I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection to my taking\\r\\nleave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't mean in the village only, but up town?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo objection.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had already\\r\\nlocked the front door and vacated the state parlor, and was seated\\r\\nby the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at the\\r\\nburning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals,\\r\\nand nothing was said for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at her\\r\\nneedle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next Joe\\r\\nin the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the glowing\\r\\ncoals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the longer the\\r\\nsilence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length I got out, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cJoe, have you told Biddy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his\\r\\nknees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to make\\r\\noff somewhere, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhich I left it to yourself, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI would rather you told, Joe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPip's a gentleman of fortun' then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand God bless him in\\r\\nit!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBiddy dropped her work, and looked at me. Joe held his knees and looked\\r\\nat me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartily\\r\\ncongratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their\\r\\ncongratulations that I rather resented.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) with the\\r\\ngrave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and say\\r\\nnothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out in good\\r\\ntime, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said, save\\r\\nthat I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron. Biddy\\r\\nnodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again,\\r\\nand said she would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining his\\r\\nknees, said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAy, ay, I'll be ekervally partickler, Pip;Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and then they\\r\\ncongratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at the\\r\\nnotion of my being a gentleman that I didn't half like it.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some idea\\r\\nof what had happened. To the best of my belief, those efforts entirely\\r\\nfailed. She laughed and nodded her head a great many times, and even\\r\\nrepeated after Biddy, the words Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPipÃ¢\\x80\\x9d and Ã¢\\x80\\x9cProperty.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d But I doubt if\\r\\nthey had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I cannot suggest\\r\\na darker picture of her state of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nI never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and\\r\\nBiddy became more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.\\r\\nDissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is\\r\\npossible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied\\r\\nwith myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny how, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand,\\r\\nlooking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and\\r\\nabout what they should do without me, and all that. And whenever I\\r\\ncaught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they\\r\\noften looked at me,--particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if they\\r\\nwere expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never did\\r\\nby word or sign.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen\\r\\ndoor opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings to\\r\\nair the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am afraid\\r\\nI took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic\\r\\nobjects among which I had passed my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSaturday night,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese\\r\\nand beer. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFive more days, and then the day before the day! They'll soon\\r\\ngo.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey'll soon go.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSoon, soon go,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and\\r\\norder my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I'll come and put\\r\\nthem on there, or that I'll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook's. It\\r\\nwould be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure\\r\\ntoo, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheese on\\r\\nit, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper\\r\\nas if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSo might\\r\\nWopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's just what I don't want, Joe. They would make such a business of\\r\\nit,--such a coarse and common business,--that I couldn't bear myself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, that indeed, Pip!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf you couldn't abear yourself--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBiddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister's plate, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHave you\\r\\nthought about when you'll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister\\r\\nand me? You will show yourself to us; won't you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I returned with some resentment, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou are so exceedingly quick\\r\\nthat it's difficult to keep up with you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n(Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe always were quick,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d observed Joe.)\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say\\r\\nthat I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,--most likely\\r\\non the evening before I go away.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBiddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an\\r\\naffectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed. When I got\\r\\ninto my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a mean\\r\\nlittle room that I should soon be parted from and raised above, for\\r\\never. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even at\\r\\nthe same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind\\r\\nbetween it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in\\r\\nso often between the forge and Miss Havisham's, and Biddy and Estella.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and\\r\\nthe room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I saw\\r\\nJoe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or two\\r\\nin the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and light\\r\\nit for him. He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me that he\\r\\nwanted comforting, for some reason or other.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his pipe,\\r\\nand Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew that they\\r\\ntalked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both\\r\\nof them more than once. I would not have listened for more, if I could\\r\\nhave heard more; so I drew away from the window, and sat down in my one\\r\\nchair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this\\r\\nfirst night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest I had ever\\r\\nknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe's pipe\\r\\nfloating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,--not\\r\\nobtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared\\r\\ntogether. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy\\r\\nbed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XIX\\r\\n\\r\\nMorning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life,\\r\\nand brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. What lay\\r\\nheaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened\\r\\nbetween me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of\\r\\na misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and\\r\\nthat, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean\\r\\ngone.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our\\r\\napproaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did. After\\r\\nbreakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best\\r\\nparlor, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. With\\r\\nall the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe, and\\r\\nthought perhaps the clergyman wouldn't have read that about the rich man\\r\\nand the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off\\r\\nthe marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church, I\\r\\nfelt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassion\\r\\nfor the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after\\r\\nSunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the\\r\\nlow green mounds. I promised myself that I would do something for them\\r\\none of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a\\r\\ndinner of roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of\\r\\ncondescension, upon everybody in the village.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my\\r\\ncompanionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among those\\r\\ngraves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place recalled\\r\\nthe wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron and badge! My\\r\\ncomfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he had doubtless\\r\\nbeen transported a long way off, and that he was dead to me, and might\\r\\nbe veritably dead into the bargain.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of these\\r\\ngrazing cattle,--though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a\\r\\nmore respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they\\r\\nmight stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great\\r\\nexpectations,--farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood,\\r\\nhenceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith's work in\\r\\ngeneral, and for you! I made my exultant way to the old Battery, and,\\r\\nlying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham intended\\r\\nme for Estella, fell asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me,\\r\\nsmoking his pipe. He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my\\r\\neyes, and said,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs being the last time, Pip, I thought I'd foller.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd Joe, I am very glad you did so.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThankee, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou may be sure, dear Joe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I went on, after we had shaken hands, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat\\r\\nI shall never forget you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no, Pip!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, in a comfortable tone, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'm sure of that. Ay,\\r\\nay, old chap! Bless you, it were only necessary to get it well round in\\r\\na man's mind, to be certain on it. But it took a bit of time to get it\\r\\nwell round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn't it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSomehow, I was not best pleased with Joe's being so mightily secure of\\r\\nme. I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion, or to have said,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt does you credit, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d or something of that sort. Therefore, I made\\r\\nno remark on Joe's first head; merely saying as to his second, that the\\r\\ntidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a\\r\\ngentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I\\r\\nwere one.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you though?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAstonishing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's a pity now, Joe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat you did not get on a little more,\\r\\nwhen we had our lessons here; isn't it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, I don't know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'm so awful dull. I'm only master\\r\\nof my own trade. It were always a pity as I was so awful dull; but it's\\r\\nno more of a pity now, than it was--this day twelvemonth--don't you\\r\\nsee?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able to\\r\\ndo something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he\\r\\nhad been better qualified for a rise in station. He was so perfectly\\r\\ninnocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to\\r\\nBiddy in preference.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our\\r\\nlittle garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a\\r\\ngeneral way for the elevation of her spirits, that I should never forget\\r\\nher, said I had a favor to ask of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd it is, Biddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat you will not omit any opportunity of\\r\\nhelping Joe on, a little.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow helping him on?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell! Joe is a dear good fellow,--in fact, I think he is the dearest\\r\\nfellow that ever lived,--but he is rather backward in some things. For\\r\\ninstance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened her\\r\\neyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO, his manners! won't his manners do then?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Biddy, plucking a\\r\\nblack-currant leaf.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear Biddy, they do very well here--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO! they do very well here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d interrupted Biddy, looking closely at the\\r\\nleaf in her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHear me out,--but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I\\r\\nshall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they would\\r\\nhardly do him justice.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd don't you think he knows that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Biddy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most\\r\\ndistant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy, what do you mean?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBiddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,--and the\\r\\nsmell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening\\r\\nin the little garden by the side of the lane,--said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHave you never\\r\\nconsidered that he may be proud?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cProud?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO! there are many kinds of pride,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy, looking full at me and\\r\\nshaking her head; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cpride is not all of one kind--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell? What are you stopping for?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot all of one kind,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d resumed Biddy. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe may be too proud to let any\\r\\none take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fills well\\r\\nand with respect. To tell you the truth, I think he is; though it sounds\\r\\nbold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than I do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Biddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am very sorry to see this in you. I did not\\r\\nexpect to see this in you. You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. You\\r\\nare dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can't help\\r\\nshowing it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you have the heart to think so,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Biddy, Ã¢\\x80\\x9csay so. Say so\\r\\nover and over again, if you have the heart to think so.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, in a virtuous\\r\\nand superior tone; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdon't put it off upon me. I am very sorry to see it,\\r\\nand it's a--it's a bad side of human nature. I did intend to ask you\\r\\nto use any little opportunities you might have after I was gone, of\\r\\nimproving dear Joe. But after this I ask you nothing. I am extremely\\r\\nsorry to see this in you, Biddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I repeated. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt's a--it's a bad side\\r\\nof human nature.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhether you scold me or approve of me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned poor Biddy, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou may\\r\\nequally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here,\\r\\nat all times. And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make\\r\\nno difference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentleman should not be\\r\\nunjust neither,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy, turning away her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nI again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature (in which\\r\\nsentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to think I\\r\\nwas right), and I walked down the little path away from Biddy, and\\r\\nBiddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and took a\\r\\ndejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very sorrowful and\\r\\nstrange that this, the second night of my bright fortunes, should be as\\r\\nlonely and unsatisfactory as the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency to\\r\\nBiddy, and we dropped the subject. Putting on the best clothes I had,\\r\\nI went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open,\\r\\nand presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor, who was having his\\r\\nbreakfast in the parlor behind his shop, and who did not think it worth\\r\\nhis while to come out to me, but called me into him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow are\\r\\nyou, and what can I do for you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather-beds, and was\\r\\nslipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up. He was a\\r\\nprosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperous\\r\\nlittle garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let into\\r\\nthe wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt that heaps of\\r\\nhis prosperity were put away in it in bags.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Trabb,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit's an unpleasant thing to have to mention,\\r\\nbecause it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome\\r\\nproperty.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA change passed over Mr. Trabb. He forgot the butter in bed, got up from\\r\\nthe bedside, and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLord\\r\\nbless my soul!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am going up to my guardian in London,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, casually drawing some\\r\\nguineas out of my pocket and looking at them; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I want a fashionable\\r\\nsuit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I added--otherwise I\\r\\nthought he might only pretend to make them, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwith ready money.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, opened\\r\\nhis arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each\\r\\nelbow, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdon't hurt me by mentioning that. May I venture to congratulate\\r\\nyou? Would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Trabb's boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side.\\r\\nWhen I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened his\\r\\nlabors by sweeping over me. He was still sweeping when I came out into\\r\\nthe shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possible\\r\\ncorners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality with any\\r\\nblacksmith, alive or dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHold that noise,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cor I'll\\r\\nknock your head off!--Do me the favor to be seated, sir. Now, this,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out in a\\r\\nflowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand under\\r\\nit to show the gloss, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis a very sweet article. I can recommend it for\\r\\nyour purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you shall\\r\\nsee some others. Give me Number Four, you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (To the boy, and with a\\r\\ndreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant's\\r\\nbrushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had\\r\\ndeposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.\\r\\nThen he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd let\\r\\nme have none of your tricks here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Trabb, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cor you shall repent\\r\\nit, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential\\r\\nconfidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an\\r\\narticle much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that\\r\\nit would ever be an honor to him to reflect upon a distinguished\\r\\nfellow-townsman's (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) having\\r\\nworn. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAre you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr.\\r\\nTrabb to the boy after that, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cor shall I kick you out of the shop and\\r\\nbring them myself?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb's\\r\\njudgment, and re-entered the parlor to be measured. For although Mr.\\r\\nTrabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented\\r\\nwith it, he said apologetically that it Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwouldn't do under existing\\r\\ncircumstances, sir,--wouldn't do at all.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d So, Mr. Trabb measured and\\r\\ncalculated me in the parlor, as if I were an estate and he the finest\\r\\nspecies of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that\\r\\nI felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his\\r\\npains. When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles\\r\\nto Mr. Pumblechook's on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand\\r\\nupon the parlor lock, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be\\r\\nexpected to patronize local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a\\r\\nturn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem\\r\\nit. Good morning, sir, much obliged.--Door!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what\\r\\nit meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his\\r\\nhands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money\\r\\nwas, that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb's boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this memorable event, I went to the hatter's, and the bootmaker's,\\r\\nand the hosier's, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard's dog whose outfit\\r\\nrequired the services of so many trades. I also went to the coach-office\\r\\nand took my place for seven o'clock on Saturday morning. It was\\r\\nnot necessary to explain everywhere that I had come into a handsome\\r\\nproperty; but whenever I said anything to that effect, it followed that\\r\\nthe officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through\\r\\nthe window by the High Street, and concentrated his mind upon me. When\\r\\nI had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my steps towards\\r\\nPumblechook's, and, as I approached that gentleman's place of business,\\r\\nI saw him standing at his door.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was waiting for me with great impatience. He had been out early with\\r\\nthe chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the news. He had\\r\\nprepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlor, and he too ordered\\r\\nhis shopman to Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccome out of the gangwayÃ¢\\x80\\x9d as my sacred person passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear friend,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, when\\r\\nhe and I and the collation were alone, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI give you joy of your good\\r\\nfortune. Well deserved, well deserved!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way of\\r\\nexpressing himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTo think,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me for\\r\\nsome moments, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat I should have been the humble instrument of leading\\r\\nup to this, is a proud reward.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or\\r\\nhinted, on that point.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear young friend,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif you will allow me to\\r\\ncall you so--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI murmured Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCertainly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands again,\\r\\nand communicated a movement to his waistcoat, which had an emotional\\r\\nappearance, though it was rather low down, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear young friend, rely\\r\\nupon my doing my little all in your absence, by keeping the fact before\\r\\nthe mind of Joseph.--Joseph!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, in the way of a\\r\\ncompassionate adjuration. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cJoseph!! Joseph!!!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Thereupon he shook his\\r\\nhead and tapped it, expressing his sense of deficiency in Joseph.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut my dear young friend,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou must be hungry,\\r\\nyou must be exhausted. Be seated. Here is a chicken had round from the\\r\\nBoar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar, here's one or two little\\r\\nthings had round from the Boar, that I hope you may not despise. But do\\r\\nI,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after he had sat\\r\\ndown, Ã¢\\x80\\x9csee afore me, him as I ever sported with in his times of happy\\r\\ninfancy? And may I--may I--?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis May I, meant might he shake hands? I consented, and he was fervent,\\r\\nand then sat down again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHere is wine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet us drink, Thanks to Fortune,\\r\\nand may she ever pick out her favorites with equal judgment! And yet I\\r\\ncannot,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, Ã¢\\x80\\x9csee afore me One--and\\r\\nlikewise drink to One--without again expressing--May I--may I--?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied his glass\\r\\nand turned it upside down. I did the same; and if I had turned myself\\r\\nupside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more direct to\\r\\nmy head.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of\\r\\ntongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), and\\r\\ntook, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAh! poultry,\\r\\npoultry! You little thought,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophizing the\\r\\nfowl in the dish, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhen you was a young fledgling, what was in store for\\r\\nyou. You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble\\r\\nroof for one as--Call it a weakness, if you will,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook,\\r\\ngetting up again, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut may I? may I--?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might, so\\r\\nhe did it at once. How he ever did it so often without wounding himself\\r\\nwith my knife, I don't know.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd your sister,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he resumed, after a little steady eating, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhich had\\r\\nthe honor of bringing you up by hand! It's a sad picter, to reflect that\\r\\nshe's no longer equal to fully understanding the honor. May--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw he was about to come at me again, and I stopped him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe'll drink her health,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccid\\r\\nwith admiration, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat's the way you know 'em, sir!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d (I don't know\\r\\nwho Sir was, but he certainly was not I, and there was no third person\\r\\npresent); Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat's the way you know the noble-minded, sir! Ever forgiving\\r\\nand ever affable. It might,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the servile Pumblechook, putting down\\r\\nhis untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto a common person,\\r\\nhave the appearance of repeating--but may I--?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet us\\r\\nnever be blind,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto her faults of temper, but it\\r\\nis to be hoped she meant well.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed in\\r\\nthe face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.\\r\\n\\r\\nI mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes\\r\\nsent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him. I\\r\\nmentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village,\\r\\nand he lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but himself, he\\r\\nintimated, worthy of my confidence, and--in short, might he? Then he\\r\\nasked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we\\r\\nhad gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he\\r\\nhad ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend? If I had taken\\r\\nten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that he\\r\\nnever had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of\\r\\nhearts have repudiated the idea. Yet for all that, I remember feeling\\r\\nconvinced that I had been much mistaken in him, and that he was a\\r\\nsensible, practical, good-hearted prime fellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask my\\r\\nadvice in reference to his own affairs. He mentioned that there was an\\r\\nopportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed\\r\\ntrade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred\\r\\nbefore in that or any other neighborhood. What alone was wanting to the\\r\\nrealization of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.\\r\\nThose were the two little words, more capital. Now it appeared to him\\r\\n(Pumblechook) that if that capital were got into the business, through a\\r\\nsleeping partner, sir,--which sleeping partner would have nothing to\\r\\ndo but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he pleased, and examine\\r\\nthe books,--and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his\\r\\npocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,--it appeared to him that that\\r\\nmight be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with\\r\\nproperty, which would be worthy of his attention. But what did I think?\\r\\nHe had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think? I gave it\\r\\nas my opinion. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWait a bit!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The united vastness and distinctness of\\r\\nthis view so struck him, that he no longer asked if he might shake hands\\r\\nwith me, but said he really must,--and did.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and over\\r\\nagain to keep Joseph up to the mark (I don't know what mark), and to\\r\\nrender me efficient and constant service (I don't know what service). He\\r\\nalso made known to me for the first time in my life, and certainly after\\r\\nhaving kept his secret wonderfully well, that he had always said of me,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat boy is no common boy, and mark me, his fortun' will be no common\\r\\nfortun'.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to\\r\\nthink of now, and I said so too. Finally, I went out into the air, with\\r\\na dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the\\r\\nsunshine, and found that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without\\r\\nhaving taken any account of the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook's hailing me. He was a long way\\r\\ndown the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to\\r\\nstop. I stopped, and he came up breathless.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, my dear friend,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, when he had recovered wind for speech.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass without\\r\\nthat affability on your part.--May I, as an old friend and well-wisher?\\r\\nMay I?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he ordered a young\\r\\ncarter out of my way with the greatest indignation. Then, he blessed\\r\\nme and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the\\r\\nroad; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge\\r\\nbefore I pursued my way home.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the little\\r\\nI possessed was adapted to my new station. But I began packing that same\\r\\nafternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want next\\r\\nmorning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I\\r\\nwent to Mr. Pumblechook's, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to\\r\\nMiss Havisham. Mr. Pumblechook's own room was given up to me to dress\\r\\nin, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event. My\\r\\nclothes were rather a disappointment, of course. Probably every new\\r\\nand eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell\\r\\na trifle short of the wearer's expectation. But after I had had my\\r\\nnew suit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity of\\r\\nposturing with Mr. Pumblechook's very limited dressing-glass, in the\\r\\nfutile endeavor to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better. It being\\r\\nmarket morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off, Mr. Pumblechook\\r\\nwas not at home. I had not told him exactly when I meant to leave, and\\r\\nwas not likely to shake hands with him again before departing. This was\\r\\nall as it should be, and I went out in my new array, fearfully ashamed\\r\\nof having to pass the shopman, and suspicious after all that I was at a\\r\\npersonal disadvantage, something like Joe's in his Sunday suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went circuitously to Miss Havisham's by all the back ways, and rang\\r\\nat the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of my\\r\\ngloves. Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when\\r\\nshe saw me so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned from\\r\\nbrown to green and yellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou? Good gracious! What do you want?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am going to London, Miss Pocket,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand want to say good-bye to\\r\\nMiss Havisham.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she went\\r\\nto ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she returned\\r\\nand took me up, staring at me all the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread\\r\\ntable, leaning on her crutch stick. The room was lighted as of yore, and\\r\\nat the sound of our entrance, she stopped and turned. She was then just\\r\\nabreast of the rotted bride-cake.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDon't go, Sarah,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI start for London, Miss Havisham, to-morrow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I was exceedingly\\r\\ncareful what I said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I thought you would kindly not mind my taking\\r\\nleave of you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is a gay figure, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she, making her crutch stick play\\r\\nround me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, were\\r\\nbestowing the finishing gift.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss\\r\\nHavisham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I murmured. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAy, ay!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, with\\r\\ndelight. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have seen Mr. Jaggers. I have heard about it, Pip. So you go\\r\\nto-morrow?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Miss Havisham.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd you are adopted by a rich person?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Miss Havisham.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot named?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, Miss Havisham.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Miss Havisham.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was her\\r\\nenjoyment of Sarah Pocket's jealous dismay. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went on; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou\\r\\nhave a promising career before you. Be good--deserve it--and abide by\\r\\nMr. Jaggers's instructions.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She looked at me, and looked at Sarah, and\\r\\nSarah's countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGood-bye,\\r\\nPip!--you will always keep the name of Pip, you know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Miss Havisham.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood-bye, Pip!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stretched out her hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to\\r\\nmy lips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it came\\r\\nnaturally to me at the moment to do this. She looked at Sarah Pocket\\r\\nwith triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with\\r\\nboth her hands on her crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimly\\r\\nlighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.\\r\\n\\r\\nSarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seen\\r\\nout. She could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degree\\r\\nconfounded. I said Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGood-bye, Miss Pocket;Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but she merely stared, and\\r\\ndid not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken. Clear of the\\r\\nhouse, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook's, took off my new\\r\\nclothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress,\\r\\ncarrying it--to speak the truth--much more at my ease too, though I had\\r\\nthe bundle to carry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had\\r\\nrun out fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more\\r\\nsteadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled\\r\\naway, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more\\r\\nappreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I\\r\\ndressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my\\r\\nsplendor until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion, graced by\\r\\nthe inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish with. We were\\r\\nall very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little\\r\\nhand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all\\r\\nalone. I am afraid--sore afraid--that this purpose originated in my\\r\\nsense of the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to\\r\\nthe coach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing\\r\\nof this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room\\r\\non this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and\\r\\nhad an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me\\r\\nin the morning. I did not.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places\\r\\ninstead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now\\r\\npigs, now men,--never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied\\r\\nme until the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and\\r\\npartly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in\\r\\ntaking it fell asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not\\r\\nsleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when\\r\\nI started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon.\\r\\nBut long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking of the\\r\\nteacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go downstairs.\\r\\nAfter all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping\\r\\nmy small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again, until Biddy\\r\\ncalled to me that I was late.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,\\r\\nsaying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell! I suppose I must be off!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and then I kissed my sister who was\\r\\nlaughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed\\r\\nBiddy, and threw my arms around Joe's neck. Then I took up my little\\r\\nportmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I presently\\r\\nheard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing an old\\r\\nshoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped then, to\\r\\nwave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above his head,\\r\\ncrying huskily Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHooroar!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and Biddy put her apron to her face.\\r\\n\\r\\nI walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had\\r\\nsupposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to\\r\\nhave had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High\\r\\nStreet. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very\\r\\npeaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to\\r\\nshow me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all\\r\\nbeyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave\\r\\nand sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of the\\r\\nvillage, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGood-bye, O my dear, dear\\r\\nfriend!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHeaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain\\r\\nupon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was\\r\\nbetter after I had cried than before,--more sorry, more aware of my own\\r\\ningratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joe\\r\\nwith me then.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the\\r\\ncourse of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was clear\\r\\nof the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get\\r\\ndown when we changed horses and walk back, and have another evening at\\r\\nhome, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not made up my mind,\\r\\nand still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to\\r\\nget down and walk back, when we changed again. And while I was occupied\\r\\nwith these deliberations, I would fancy an exact resemblance to Joe\\r\\nin some man coming along the road towards us, and my heart would beat\\r\\nhigh.--As if he could possibly be there!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to\\r\\ngo back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and\\r\\nthe world lay spread before me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the end of the first stage of Pip's expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XX\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five\\r\\nhours. It was a little past midday when the four-horse stage-coach by\\r\\nwhich I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about\\r\\nthe Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable\\r\\nto doubt our having and our being the best of everything: otherwise,\\r\\nwhile I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I might have had\\r\\nsome faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly, crooked, narrow, and\\r\\ndirty.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, and he\\r\\nhad written after it on his card, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cjust out of Smithfield, and close by\\r\\nthe coach-office.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to have\\r\\nas many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old, packed me\\r\\nup in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of\\r\\nsteps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles. His getting on his\\r\\nbox, which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained\\r\\npea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a work of time.\\r\\nIt was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets outside, and ragged\\r\\nthings behind for I don't know how many footmen to hold on by, and\\r\\na harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the\\r\\ntemptation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a\\r\\nstraw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why\\r\\nthe horses' nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman\\r\\nbeginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stop\\r\\nwe presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open\\r\\ndoor, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow much?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked the coachman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coachman answered, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA shilling--unless you wish to make it more.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI naturally said I had no wish to make it more.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen it must be a shilling,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d observed the coachman. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't want to\\r\\nget into trouble. I know him!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He darkly closed an eye at Mr. Jaggers's\\r\\nname, and shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed the\\r\\nascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve his\\r\\nmind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my\\r\\nhand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe is not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the clerk. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe is in Court at present. Am I\\r\\naddressing Mr. Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room. He couldn't say how\\r\\nlong he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, his time\\r\\nbeing valuable, that he won't be longer than he can help.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner\\r\\nchamber at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a\\r\\nvelveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve on\\r\\nbeing interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGo and wait outside, Mike,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the clerk.\\r\\n\\r\\nI began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerk\\r\\nshoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used,\\r\\nand tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Jaggers's room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most dismal\\r\\nplace; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head, and the\\r\\ndistorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to\\r\\npeep down at me through it. There were not so many papers about, as I\\r\\nshould have expected to see; and there were some odd objects about, that\\r\\nI should not have expected to see,--such as an old rusty pistol, a\\r\\nsword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and packages, and\\r\\ntwo dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly swollen, and twitchy\\r\\nabout the nose. Mr. Jaggers's own high-backed chair was of deadly black\\r\\nhorsehair, with rows of brass nails round it, like a coffin; and I\\r\\nfancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and bit his forefinger at\\r\\nthe clients. The room was but small, and the clients seemed to have had\\r\\na habit of backing up against the wall; the wall, especially opposite to\\r\\nMr. Jaggers's chair, being greasy with shoulders. I recalled, too, that\\r\\nthe one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was\\r\\nthe innocent cause of his being turned out.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers's\\r\\nchair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I\\r\\ncalled to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to\\r\\neverybody else's disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many\\r\\nother clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have\\r\\nthe same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what\\r\\nwas the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came\\r\\nthere. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers's\\r\\nfamily, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such\\r\\nill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the\\r\\nblacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.\\r\\nOf course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits may\\r\\nhave been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and grit\\r\\nthat lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr.\\r\\nJaggers's close room, until I really could not bear the two casts on the\\r\\nshelf above Mr. Jaggers's chair, and got up and went out.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I\\r\\nwaited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into\\r\\nSmithfield. So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being all\\r\\nasmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to me. So,\\r\\nI rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where\\r\\nI saw the great black dome of Saint Paul's bulging at me from behind a\\r\\ngrim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison. Following\\r\\nthe wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered with straw to deaden\\r\\nthe noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and from the quantity of\\r\\npeople standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer, I inferred\\r\\nthat the trials were on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk\\r\\nminister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a\\r\\ntrial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for half a\\r\\ncrown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice in\\r\\nhis wig and robes,--mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and\\r\\npresently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen-pence. As I\\r\\ndeclined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good as\\r\\nto take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also\\r\\nwhere people were publicly whipped, and then he showed me the Debtors'\\r\\nDoor, out of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interest\\r\\nof that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfour on 'emÃ¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the\\r\\nmorning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a\\r\\nsickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice's\\r\\nproprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to his\\r\\npocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently\\r\\nnot belonged to him originally, and which I took it into my head he had\\r\\nbought cheap of the executioner. Under these circumstances I thought\\r\\nmyself well rid of him for a shilling.\\r\\n\\r\\nI dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I\\r\\nfound he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour\\r\\nof Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became\\r\\naware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well\\r\\nas I. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew\\r\\nClose, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the\\r\\npavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when\\r\\nthey first passed me, that Ã¢\\x80\\x9cJaggers would do it if it was to be done.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and\\r\\none of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted\\r\\nher by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cJaggers\\r\\nis for him, 'Melia, and what more could you have?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d There was a red-eyed\\r\\nlittle Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there, in\\r\\ncompany with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand; and\\r\\nwhile the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a highly\\r\\nexcitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp-post and\\r\\naccompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the words, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cO Jaggerth,\\r\\nJaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth, give me Jaggerth!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep\\r\\nimpression on me, and I admired and wondered more than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close\\r\\ninto Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards\\r\\nme. All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time, and there\\r\\nwas quite a rush at him. Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder\\r\\nand walking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressed\\r\\nhimself to his followers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, he took the two secret men.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, I have nothing to say to you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his\\r\\nfinger at them. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI want to know no more than I know. As to the result,\\r\\nit's a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have you\\r\\npaid Wemmick?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe made the money up this morning, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said one of the men,\\r\\nsubmissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers's face.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it\\r\\nup at all. Has Wemmick got it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said both the men together.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery well; then you may go. Now, I won't have it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr Jaggers,\\r\\nwaving his hand at them to put them behind him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf you say a word to\\r\\nme, I'll throw up the case.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe thought, Mr. Jaggers--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d one of the men began, pulling off his hat.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's what I told you not to do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou thought! I\\r\\nthink for you; that's enough for you. If I want you, I know where to\\r\\nfind you; I don't want you to find me. Now I won't have it. I won't hear\\r\\na word.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind\\r\\nagain, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd now you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on\\r\\nthe two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly\\r\\nseparated,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh! Amelia, is it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Mr. Jaggers.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd do you remember,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d retorted Mr. Jaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat but for me you\\r\\nwouldn't be here and couldn't be here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO yes, sir!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed both women together. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLord bless you, sir, well\\r\\nwe knows that!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen why,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdo you come here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy Bill, sir!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the crying woman pleaded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, I tell you what!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOnce for all. If you don't\\r\\nknow that your Bill's in good hands, I know it. And if you come here\\r\\nbothering about your Bill, I'll make an example of both your Bill and\\r\\nyou, and let him slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO yes, sir! Every farden.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another\\r\\nword--one single word--and Wemmick shall give you your money back.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately.\\r\\nNo one remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the\\r\\nskirts of Mr. Jaggers's coat to his lips several times.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't know this man!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating\\r\\nstrain: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat does this fellow want?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMa thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWho's he?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet go of my coat.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing\\r\\nit, replied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHabraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou're too late,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am over the way.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHoly father, Mithter Jaggerth!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried my excitable acquaintance,\\r\\nturning white, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdon't thay you're again Habraham Latharuth!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand there's an end of it. Get out of the\\r\\nway.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen'th gone to Mithter\\r\\nWemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth. Mithter\\r\\nJaggerth! Half a quarter of a moment! If you'd have the condethenthun to\\r\\nbe bought off from the t'other thide--at hany thuperior prithe!--money\\r\\nno object!--Mithter Jaggerth--Mithter--!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference, and\\r\\nleft him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot. Without further\\r\\ninterruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk and\\r\\nthe man in velveteen with the fur cap.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHere's Mike,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the clerk, getting down from his stool, and\\r\\napproaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of\\r\\nhair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling\\r\\nat the bell-rope; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyour man comes on this afternoon. Well?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Mas'r Jaggers,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a\\r\\nconstitutional cold; Ã¢\\x80\\x9carter a deal o' trouble, I've found one, sir, as\\r\\nmight do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is he prepared to swear?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Mas'r Jaggers,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap this\\r\\ntime; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cin a general way, anythink.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow, I warned you before,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nhe, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat if you ever\\r\\npresumed to talk in that way here, I'd make an example of you. You\\r\\ninfernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were unconscious\\r\\nwhat he had done.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSpooney!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with his\\r\\nelbow. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSoft Head! Need you say it face to face?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, I ask you, you blundering booby,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my guardian, very sternly,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9conce more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is\\r\\nprepared to swear?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lesson\\r\\nfrom his face, and slowly replied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAyther to character, or to having\\r\\nbeen in his company and never left him all the night in question.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, be careful. In what station of life is this man?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the\\r\\nceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before\\r\\nbeginning to reply in a nervous manner, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe've dressed him up like--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n when my guardian blustered out,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat? You WILL, will you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n(Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSpooney!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d added the clerk again, with another stir.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe is dressed like a 'spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs he here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked my guardian.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI left him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mike, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ca setting on some doorsteps round the corner.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTake him past that window, and let me see him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe window indicated was the office window. We all three went to\\r\\nit, behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an\\r\\naccidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short\\r\\nsuit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner was not\\r\\nby any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery,\\r\\nwhich was painted over.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTell him to take his witness away directly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my guardian to the\\r\\nclerk, in extreme disgust, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand ask him what he means by bringing such a\\r\\nfellow as that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched,\\r\\nstanding, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (he seemed to\\r\\nbully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me what arrangements he\\r\\nhad made for me. I was to go to Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBarnard's Inn,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d to young Mr. Pocket's\\r\\nrooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I was to\\r\\nremain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go with\\r\\nhim to his father's house on a visit, that I might try how I liked it.\\r\\nAlso, I was told what my allowance was to be,--it was a very liberal\\r\\none,--and had handed to me from one of my guardian's drawers, the cards\\r\\nof certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes,\\r\\nand such other things as I could in reason want. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou will find your\\r\\ncredit good, Mr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt\\r\\nlike a whole caskful, as he hastily refreshed himself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I shall by\\r\\nthis means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find you\\r\\noutrunning the constable. Of course you'll go wrong somehow, but that's\\r\\nno fault of mine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked\\r\\nMr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was not worth while,\\r\\nI was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me, if I\\r\\npleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nI then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk\\r\\nwas rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out, and I\\r\\naccompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.\\r\\nWe found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way\\r\\namong them by saying coolly yet decisively, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI tell you it's no use; he\\r\\nwon't have a word to say to one of you;Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and we soon got clear of them,\\r\\nand went on side by side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXI\\r\\n\\r\\nCasting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was\\r\\nlike in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in\\r\\nstature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have been\\r\\nimperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some marks\\r\\nin it that might have been dimples, if the material had been softer and\\r\\nthe instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints. The chisel\\r\\nhad made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose,\\r\\nbut had given them up without an effort to smooth them off. I judged him\\r\\nto be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen, and he appeared\\r\\nto have sustained a good many bereavements; for he wore at least four\\r\\nmourning rings, besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping\\r\\nwillow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too, that several rings\\r\\nand seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he were quite laden with\\r\\nremembrances of departed friends. He had glittering eyes,--small, keen,\\r\\nand black,--and thin wide mottled lips. He had had them, to the best of\\r\\nmy belief, from forty to fifty years.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo you were never in London before?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wemmick to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI was new here once,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cRum to think of now!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are well acquainted with it now?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, yes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI know the moves of it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs it a very wicked place?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked, more for the sake of saying\\r\\nsomething than for information.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are\\r\\nplenty of people anywhere, who'll do that for you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf there is bad blood between you and them,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, to soften it off a\\r\\nlittle.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO! I don't know about bad blood,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Wemmick; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthere's not\\r\\nmuch bad blood about. They'll do it, if there's anything to be got by\\r\\nit.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat makes it worse.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou think so?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMuch about the same, I should\\r\\nsay.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before him:\\r\\nwalking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the streets\\r\\nto claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a mouth\\r\\nthat he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the top of\\r\\nHolborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance,\\r\\nand that he was not smiling at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked Mr. Wemmick.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, nodding in the direction. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAt Hammersmith, west of\\r\\nLondon.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs that far?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell! Say five miles.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you know him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, you're a regular cross-examiner!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me\\r\\nwith an approving air. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I know him. I know him!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of\\r\\nthese words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways\\r\\nat his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text,\\r\\nwhen he said here we were at Barnard's Inn. My depression was not\\r\\nalleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment\\r\\nto be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town\\r\\nwas a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied\\r\\nspirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby\\r\\nbuildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for\\r\\nTom-cats.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an\\r\\nintroductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me\\r\\nlike a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in\\r\\nit, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the most\\r\\ndismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever seen. I\\r\\nthought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were\\r\\ndivided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain, crippled\\r\\nflower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable makeshift; while\\r\\nTo Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms, as if no new\\r\\nwretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were\\r\\nbeing slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants\\r\\nand their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy mourning of soot\\r\\nand smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard, and it had strewn\\r\\nashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere\\r\\ndust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry rot and wet rot and all\\r\\nthe silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar,--rot of rat\\r\\nand mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand besides--addressed\\r\\nthemselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTry Barnard's\\r\\nMixture.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations,\\r\\nthat I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, mistaking me;\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cthe retirement reminds you of the country. So it does me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,--which\\r\\nappeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of\\r\\nthose days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find\\r\\nthemselves without the means of coming down,--to a set of chambers on\\r\\nthe top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was\\r\\na label on the letter-box, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cReturn shortly.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe hardly thought you'd come so soon,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Wemmick explained. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\ndon't want me any more?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, thank you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs I keep the cash,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Wemmick observed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe shall most likely meet\\r\\npretty often. Good day.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood day.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he\\r\\nthought I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, correcting\\r\\nhimself,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTo be sure! Yes. You're in the habit of shaking hands?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,\\r\\nbut said yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have got so out of it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wemmick,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cexcept at last. Very\\r\\nglad, I'm sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window\\r\\nand had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it\\r\\ncame down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not\\r\\nput my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view\\r\\nof the Inn through the window's encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully\\r\\nlooking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pocket, Junior's, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly\\r\\nmaddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written\\r\\nmy name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the\\r\\nwindow, before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually there arose\\r\\nbefore me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a\\r\\nmember of society of about my own standing. He had a paper-bag under\\r\\neach arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of\\r\\nbreath.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Pocket?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a\\r\\ncoach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would\\r\\ncome by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,--not\\r\\nthat that is any excuse,--for I thought, coming from the country, you\\r\\nmight like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden\\r\\nMarket to get it good.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my\\r\\nhead. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think this\\r\\nwas a dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pocket, Junior. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThis door sticks so!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while\\r\\nthe paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold\\r\\nthem. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with\\r\\nthe door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last,\\r\\nthat he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite\\r\\ndoor, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start out\\r\\nof my head, and as if this must be a dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPray come in,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pocket, Junior. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAllow me to lead the way. I am\\r\\nrather bare here, but I hope you'll be able to make out tolerably well\\r\\ntill Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably through\\r\\nto-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk about\\r\\nLondon. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As to our\\r\\ntable, you won't find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied from our\\r\\ncoffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your expense,\\r\\nsuch being Mr. Jaggers's directions. As to our lodging, it's not by\\r\\nany means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my father\\r\\nhasn't anything to give me, and I shouldn't be willing to take it, if he\\r\\nhad. This is our sitting-room,--just such chairs and tables and carpet\\r\\nand so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You mustn't give\\r\\nme credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors, because they come\\r\\nfor you from the coffee-house. This is my little bedroom; rather musty,\\r\\nbut Barnard's is musty. This is your bedroom; the furniture's hired for\\r\\nthe occasion, but I trust it will answer the purpose; if you should want\\r\\nanything, I'll go and fetch it. The chambers are retired, and we shall\\r\\nbe alone together, but we shan't fight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg\\r\\nyour pardon, you're holding the fruit all this time. Pray let me take\\r\\nthese bags from you. I am quite ashamed.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags, One,\\r\\nTwo, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I knew to\\r\\nbe in mine, and he said, falling back,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLord bless me, you're the prowling boy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9care the pale young gentleman!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in\\r\\nBarnard's Inn, until we both burst out laughing. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe idea of its\\r\\nbeing you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe idea of its being you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. And then we\\r\\ncontemplated one another afresh, and laughed again. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\npale young gentleman, reaching out his hand good-humoredly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit's all\\r\\nover now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you'll forgive me\\r\\nfor having knocked you about so.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was the\\r\\npale young gentleman's name) still rather confounded his intention with\\r\\nhis execution. But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou hadn't come into your good fortune at that time?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert\\r\\nPocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he acquiesced: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI heard it had happened very lately. I was rather\\r\\non the lookout for good fortune then.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIndeed?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancy to\\r\\nme. But she couldn't,--at all events, she didn't.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBad taste,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, laughing, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut a fact. Yes, she had sent for\\r\\nme on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I\\r\\nsuppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have been\\r\\nwhat-you-may-called it to Estella.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat's that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked, with sudden gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his\\r\\nattention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAffianced,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he explained, still busy with the fruit. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBetrothed.\\r\\nEngaged. What's-his-named. Any word of that sort.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow did you bear your disappointment?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPooh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI didn't care much for it. She's a Tartar.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss Havisham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't say no to that, but I meant Estella. That girl's hard and\\r\\nhaughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by\\r\\nMiss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat relation is she to Miss Havisham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNone,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOnly adopted.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy should she wreak revenge on all the male sex? What revenge?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLord, Mr. Pip!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDon't you know?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear me! It's quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time. And\\r\\nnow let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come\\r\\nthere, that day?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst\\r\\nout laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn't\\r\\nask him if he was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly\\r\\nestablished.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he went on.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know he is Miss Havisham's man of business and solicitor, and has\\r\\nher confidence when nobody else has?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered with\\r\\na constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers\\r\\nin Miss Havisham's house on the very day of our combat, but never at any\\r\\nother time, and that I believed he had no recollection of having ever\\r\\nseen me there.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he\\r\\ncalled on my father to propose it. Of course he knew about my father\\r\\nfrom his connection with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham's\\r\\ncousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he\\r\\nis a bad courtier and will not propitiate her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking.\\r\\nI had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since,\\r\\nwho more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural\\r\\nincapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something\\r\\nwonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the\\r\\nsame time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich. I\\r\\ndon't know how this was. I became imbued with the notion on that first\\r\\noccasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what\\r\\nmeans.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered languor\\r\\nabout him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did not seem\\r\\nindicative of natural strength. He had not a handsome face, but it was\\r\\nbetter than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful. His figure\\r\\nwas a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had taken such\\r\\nliberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be light and\\r\\nyoung. Whether Mr. Trabb's local work would have sat more gracefully on\\r\\nhim than on me, may be a question; but I am conscious that he carried\\r\\noff his rather old clothes much better than I carried off my new suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a\\r\\nbad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him my small story,\\r\\nand laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was.\\r\\nI further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a\\r\\ncountry place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would\\r\\ntake it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever\\r\\nhe saw me at a loss or going wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWith pleasure,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthough I venture to prophesy that you'll want\\r\\nvery few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I should like\\r\\nto banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do me the favour\\r\\nto begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI thanked him and said I would. I informed him in exchange that my\\r\\nChristian name was Philip.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't take to Philip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, smiling, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor it sounds like a moral\\r\\nboy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond,\\r\\nor so fat that he couldn't see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that\\r\\nhe locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a\\r\\nbird's-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the\\r\\nneighborhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious, and\\r\\nyou have been a blacksmith,---would you mind it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI shouldn't mind anything that you propose,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I answered, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I don't\\r\\nunderstand you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWould you mind Handel for a familiar name? There's a charming piece of\\r\\nmusic by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should like it very much.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen, my dear Handel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, turning round as the door opened,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9chere is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the table,\\r\\nbecause the dinner is of your providing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was a\\r\\nnice little dinner,--seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor's Feast,--and\\r\\nit acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent\\r\\ncircumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.\\r\\nThis again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the\\r\\nbanquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have\\r\\nsaid, the lap of luxury,--being entirely furnished forth from the\\r\\ncoffee-house,--the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a\\r\\ncomparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter\\r\\nthe wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he\\r\\nfell over them), the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the\\r\\nbookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into my\\r\\nbed in the next room,--where I found much of its parsley and butter in\\r\\na state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made the\\r\\nfeast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my\\r\\npleasure was without alloy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his\\r\\npromise to tell me about Miss Havisham.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTrue,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the topic,\\r\\nHandel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put the\\r\\nknife in the mouth,--for fear of accidents,--and that while the fork is\\r\\nreserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary. It is\\r\\nscarcely worth mentioning, only it's as well to do as other people do.\\r\\nAlso, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This has\\r\\ntwo advantages. You get at your mouth better (which after all is the\\r\\nobject), and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters, on\\r\\nthe part of the right elbow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both\\r\\nlaughed and I scarcely blushed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he pursued, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cconcerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must\\r\\nknow, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when she was a baby, and her\\r\\nfather denied her nothing. Her father was a country gentleman down in\\r\\nyour part of the world, and was a brewer. I don't know why it should\\r\\nbe a crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you\\r\\ncannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was\\r\\nand brew. You see it every day.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot on any account,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Herbert; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut a public-house may keep a\\r\\ngentleman. Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his\\r\\ndaughter.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss Havisham was an only child?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I hazarded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cStop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only child;\\r\\nshe had a half-brother. Her father privately married again--his cook, I\\r\\nrather think.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI thought he was proud,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately,\\r\\nbecause he was proud, and in course of time she died. When she was dead,\\r\\nI apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then\\r\\nthe son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are\\r\\nacquainted with. As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous,\\r\\nextravagant, undutiful,--altogether bad. At last his father disinherited\\r\\nhim; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though\\r\\nnot nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.--Take another glass of wine,\\r\\nand excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one\\r\\nto be so strictly conscientious in emptying one's glass, as to turn it\\r\\nbottom upwards with the rim on one's nose.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I\\r\\nthanked him, and apologized. He said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot at all,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and resumed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after\\r\\nas a great match. Her half-brother had now ample means again, but what\\r\\nwith debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.\\r\\nThere were stronger differences between him and her than there had been\\r\\nbetween him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished a deep\\r\\nand mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father's anger.\\r\\nNow, I come to the cruel part of the story,--merely breaking off, my\\r\\ndear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a tumbler.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to\\r\\nsay. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a\\r\\nmuch better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it\\r\\nwithin those limits. Again I thanked him and apologized, and again he\\r\\nsaid in the cheerfullest manner, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot at all, I am sure!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and resumed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere appeared upon the scene--say at the races, or the public\\r\\nballs, or anywhere else you like--a certain man, who made love to Miss\\r\\nHavisham. I never saw him (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago,\\r\\nbefore you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention that\\r\\nhe was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he was\\r\\nnot to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a gentleman, my\\r\\nfather most strongly asseverates; because it is a principle of his that\\r\\nno man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was, since the world\\r\\nbegan, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no varnish can hide the\\r\\ngrain of the wood; and that the more varnish you put on, the more the\\r\\ngrain will express itself. Well! This man pursued Miss Havisham closely,\\r\\nand professed to be devoted to her. I believe she had not shown much\\r\\nsusceptibility up to that time; but all the susceptibility she possessed\\r\\ncertainly came out then, and she passionately loved him. There is no\\r\\ndoubt that she perfectly idolized him. He practised on her affection in\\r\\nthat systematic way, that he got great sums of money from her, and he\\r\\ninduced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery (which had\\r\\nbeen weakly left him by his father) at an immense price, on the plea\\r\\nthat when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all. Your\\r\\nguardian was not at that time in Miss Havisham's counsels, and she was\\r\\ntoo haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one. Her relations\\r\\nwere poor and scheming, with the exception of my father; he was poor\\r\\nenough, but not time-serving or jealous. The only independent one among\\r\\nthem, he warned her that she was doing too much for this man, and\\r\\nwas placing herself too unreservedly in his power. She took the first\\r\\nopportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house, in his\\r\\npresence, and my father has never seen her since.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought of her having said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMatthew will come and see me at last when\\r\\nI am laid dead upon that table;Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and I asked Herbert whether his father\\r\\nwas so inveterate against her?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's not that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut she charged him, in the presence of her\\r\\nintended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon\\r\\nher for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would\\r\\nlook true--even to him--and even to her. To return to the man and make\\r\\nan end of him. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were\\r\\nbought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were\\r\\ninvited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. He wrote her a letter--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich she received,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I struck in, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhen she was dressing for her\\r\\nmarriage? At twenty minutes to nine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt the hour and minute,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, nodding, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cat which she\\r\\nafterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that\\r\\nit most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can't tell you, because I\\r\\ndon't know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she\\r\\nlaid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never since\\r\\nlooked upon the light of day.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs that all the story?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked, after considering it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAll I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it\\r\\nout for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss\\r\\nHavisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was\\r\\nabsolutely requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten one\\r\\nthing. It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced\\r\\nconfidence acted throughout in concert with her half-brother; that it\\r\\nwas a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wonder he didn't marry her and get all the property,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have\\r\\nbeen a part of her half-brother's scheme,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMind! I don't\\r\\nknow that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat became of the two men?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked, after again considering the\\r\\nsubject.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey fell into deeper shame and degradation--if there can be\\r\\ndeeper--and ruin.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre they alive now?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but\\r\\nadopted. When adopted?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert shrugged his shoulders. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere has always been an Estella, since\\r\\nI have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And now, Handel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nhe, finally throwing off the story as it were, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthere is a perfectly\\r\\nopen understanding between us. All that I know about Miss Havisham, you\\r\\nknow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd all that I know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I retorted, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity\\r\\nbetween you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold your\\r\\nadvancement in life,--namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to\\r\\nwhom you owe it,--you may be very sure that it will never be encroached\\r\\nupon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject\\r\\ndone with, even though I should be under his father's roof for years and\\r\\nyears to come. Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that I felt\\r\\nhe as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as I\\r\\nunderstood the fact myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme for\\r\\nthe purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the\\r\\nlighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this\\r\\nto be the case. We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in the\\r\\ncourse of conversation, what he was? He replied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA capitalist,--an\\r\\nInsurer of Ships.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search\\r\\nof some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIn the City.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in\\r\\nthe City, and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer\\r\\non his back, blackened his enterprising eye, and cut his responsible\\r\\nhead open. But again there came upon me, for my relief, that odd\\r\\nimpression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring\\r\\nships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut into the\\r\\nDirection. I shall also do a little in the mining way. None of these\\r\\nthings will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own\\r\\naccount. I think I shall trade,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, leaning back in his chair, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto\\r\\nthe East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and precious\\r\\nwoods. It's an interesting trade.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd the profits are large?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTremendous!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than\\r\\nmy own.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think I shall trade, also,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, putting his thumbs in his\\r\\nwaist-coat pockets, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum.\\r\\nAlso to Ceylon, specially for elephants' tusks.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou will want a good many ships,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA perfect fleet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked him\\r\\nwhere the ships he insured mostly traded to at present?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI haven't begun insuring yet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am looking about me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSomehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard's Inn. I said\\r\\n(in a tone of conviction), Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAh-h!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs a counting-house profitable?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTo--do you mean to the young fellow who's in it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked, in reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes; to you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, n-no; not to me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He said this with the air of one carefully\\r\\nreckoning up and striking a balance. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot directly profitable. That is,\\r\\nit doesn't pay me anything, and I have to--keep myself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head as\\r\\nif I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative\\r\\ncapital from such a source of income.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut the thing is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert Pocket, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat you look about you.\\r\\nThat's the grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, and you\\r\\nlook about you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt struck me as a singular implication that you couldn't be out of a\\r\\ncounting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred to\\r\\nhis experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen the time comes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhen you see your opening. And you\\r\\ngo in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then there\\r\\nyou are! When you have once made your capital, you have nothing to do\\r\\nbut employ it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden;\\r\\nvery like. His manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly corresponded\\r\\nto his manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me that he took all\\r\\nblows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine\\r\\nthen. It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest\\r\\nnecessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been\\r\\nsent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was so\\r\\nunassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being\\r\\npuffed up. It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways,\\r\\nand we got on famously. In the evening we went out for a walk in the\\r\\nstreets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went to\\r\\nchurch at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in the\\r\\nParks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joe did.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had\\r\\nleft Joe and Biddy. The space interposed between myself and them partook\\r\\nof that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. That I could\\r\\nhave been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, on the very\\r\\nlast Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of impossibilities,\\r\\ngeographical and social, solar and lunar. Yet in the London streets so\\r\\ncrowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening,\\r\\nthere were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor\\r\\nold kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of night, the footsteps\\r\\nof some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnard's Inn,\\r\\nunder pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to\\r\\nthe counting-house to report himself,--to look about him, too, I\\r\\nsuppose,--and I bore him company. He was to come away in an hour or\\r\\ntwo to attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him. It\\r\\nappeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched were\\r\\nincubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging from the\\r\\nplaces to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning. Nor\\r\\ndid the counting-house where Herbert assisted, show in my eyes as at\\r\\nall a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard, of a grimy\\r\\npresence in all particulars, and with a look into another back second\\r\\nfloor, rather than a look out.\\r\\n\\r\\nI waited about until it was noon, and I went upon 'Change, and I saw\\r\\nfluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to\\r\\nbe great merchants, though I couldn't understand why they should all be\\r\\nout of spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a celebrated\\r\\nhouse which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have been the\\r\\nmost abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help noticing,\\r\\neven then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives\\r\\nand waiters' clothes, than in the steaks. This collation disposed of at\\r\\na moderate price (considering the grease, which was not charged for), we\\r\\nwent back to Barnard's Inn and got my little portmanteau, and then took\\r\\ncoach for Hammersmith. We arrived there at two or three o'clock in\\r\\nthe afternoon, and had very little way to walk to Mr. Pocket's house.\\r\\nLifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct into a little garden\\r\\noverlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket's children were playing\\r\\nabout. And unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or\\r\\nprepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nPocket's children were not growing up or being brought up, but were\\r\\ntumbling up.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with\\r\\nher legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket's two nurse-maids\\r\\nwere looking about them while the children played. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMamma,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nHerbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthis is young Mr. Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me\\r\\nwith an appearance of amiable dignity.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMaster Alick and Miss Jane,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried one of the nurses to two of the\\r\\nchildren, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif you go a bouncing up against them bushes you'll fall over\\r\\ninto the river and be drownded, and what'll your pa say then?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket's handkerchief, and\\r\\nsaid, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf that don't make six times you've dropped it, Mum!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Upon which\\r\\nMrs. Pocket laughed and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThank you, Flopson,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and settling herself\\r\\nin one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance immediately assumed\\r\\na knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week,\\r\\nbut before she could have read half a dozen lines, she fixed her eyes\\r\\nupon me, and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI hope your mamma is quite well?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d This unexpected\\r\\ninquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the\\r\\nabsurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt she\\r\\nwould have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and\\r\\nwould have sent her compliments, when the nurse came to my rescue.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif that don't\\r\\nmake seven times! What ARE you a doing of this afternoon, Mum!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs.\\r\\nPocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterable\\r\\nsurprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of\\r\\nrecognition, and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThank you, Flopson,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and forgot me, and went on\\r\\nreading.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than\\r\\nsix little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had\\r\\nscarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the region\\r\\nof air, wailing dolefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf there ain't Baby!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Flopson, appearing to think it most\\r\\nsurprising. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMake haste up, Millers.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMillers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by degrees\\r\\nthe child's wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a young\\r\\nventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all the\\r\\ntime, and I was curious to know what the book could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any\\r\\nrate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the\\r\\nremarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed\\r\\nnear Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and\\r\\ntumbled over her,--always very much to her momentary astonishment, and\\r\\ntheir own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for\\r\\nthis surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to\\r\\nspeculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,\\r\\nwhich baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.\\r\\nPocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby\\r\\nand all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGracious me, Flopson!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a\\r\\nmoment, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ceverybody's tumbling!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGracious you, indeed, Mum!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Flopson, very red in the face;\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cwhat have you got there?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI got here, Flopson?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Mrs. Pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, if it ain't your footstool!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Flopson. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd if you keep it\\r\\nunder your skirts like that, who's to help tumbling? Here! Take the\\r\\nbaby, Mum, and give me your book.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a\\r\\nlittle in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had\\r\\nlasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders\\r\\nthat they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made the\\r\\nsecond discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the little\\r\\nPockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the children\\r\\ninto the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket came out\\r\\nof it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to find that Mr.\\r\\nPocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face, and\\r\\nwith his very gray hair disordered on his head, as if he didn't quite\\r\\nsee his way to putting anything straight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXIII\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pocket said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not sorry to\\r\\nsee him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFor, I really am not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, with his son's smile,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9can alarming personage.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He was a young-looking man, in spite of\\r\\nhis perplexities and his very gray hair, and his manner seemed quite\\r\\nnatural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected;\\r\\nthere was something comic in his distraught way, as though it would have\\r\\nbeen downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very\\r\\nnear being so. When he had talked with me a little, he said to Mrs.\\r\\nPocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, which were\\r\\nblack and handsome, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBelinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And she\\r\\nlooked up from her book, and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She then smiled upon me in an\\r\\nabsent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of orange-flower\\r\\nwater? As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on any foregone\\r\\nor subsequent transaction, I consider it to have been thrown out, like\\r\\nher previous approaches, in general conversational condescension.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs.\\r\\nPocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased\\r\\nKnight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased\\r\\nfather would have been made a Baronet but for somebody's determined\\r\\nopposition arising out of entirely personal motives,--I forget whose,\\r\\nif I ever knew,--the Sovereign's, the Prime Minister's, the Lord\\r\\nChancellor's, the Archbishop of Canterbury's, anybody's,--and had\\r\\ntacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite\\r\\nsupposititious fact. I believe he had been knighted himself for storming\\r\\nthe English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate address\\r\\nengrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of\\r\\nsome building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage either the\\r\\ntrowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directed Mrs. Pocket to\\r\\nbe brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things\\r\\nmust marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of\\r\\nplebeian domestic knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady\\r\\nby this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but\\r\\nperfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed,\\r\\nin the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was\\r\\nalso in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to mount\\r\\nto the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing the\\r\\none or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket had\\r\\ntaken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it would\\r\\nseem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the knowledge of\\r\\nthe judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing to bestow or\\r\\nwithhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that dower upon them\\r\\nafter a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket that his wife was Ã¢\\x80\\x9ca\\r\\ntreasure for a Prince.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Pocket had invested the Prince's treasure\\r\\nin the ways of the world ever since, and it was supposed to have brought\\r\\nhim in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs. Pocket was in general the\\r\\nobject of a queer sort of respectful pity, because she had not married\\r\\na title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving\\r\\nreproach, because he had never got one.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a\\r\\npleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for\\r\\nmy own private sitting-room. He then knocked at the doors of two other\\r\\nsimilar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle\\r\\nand Startop. Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order of\\r\\narchitecture, was whistling. Startop, younger in years and appearance,\\r\\nwas reading and holding his head, as if he thought himself in danger of\\r\\nexploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody\\r\\nelse's hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house\\r\\nand let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the\\r\\nservants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of saving\\r\\ntrouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the servants\\r\\nfelt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and\\r\\ndrinking, and to keep a deal of company downstairs. They allowed a very\\r\\nliberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always appeared to me that\\r\\nby far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been\\r\\nthe kitchen,--always supposing the boarder capable of self-defence, for,\\r\\nbefore I had been there a week, a neighboring lady with whom the family\\r\\nwere personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that she had seen Millers\\r\\nslapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs. Pocket, who burst into\\r\\ntears on receiving the note, and said that it was an extraordinary thing\\r\\nthat the neighbors couldn't mind their own business.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been\\r\\neducated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished himself;\\r\\nbut that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very\\r\\nearly in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling\\r\\nof a Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades,--of whom it was\\r\\nremarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always going to\\r\\nhelp him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the blades had\\r\\nleft the Grindstone,--he had wearied of that poor work and had come to\\r\\nLondon. Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he had Ã¢\\x80\\x9creadÃ¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them, and had\\r\\nrefurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned his\\r\\nacquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction,\\r\\nand on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still\\r\\nmaintained the house I saw.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbor; a widow lady of that highly\\r\\nsympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody,\\r\\nand shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances. This\\r\\nlady's name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honor of taking her down to\\r\\ndinner on the day of my installation. She gave me to understand on the\\r\\nstairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr. Pocket\\r\\nshould be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him.\\r\\nThat did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love and confidence\\r\\n(at that time, I had known her something less than five minutes); if\\r\\nthey were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut dear Mrs. Pocket,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Coiler, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cafter her early\\r\\ndisappointment (not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that), requires\\r\\nso much luxury and elegance--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, ma'am,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I said, to stop her, for I was afraid she was going to\\r\\ncry.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd she is of so aristocratic a disposition--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, ma'am,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I said again, with the same object as before.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c--That it is hard,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Coiler, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto have dear Mr. Pocket's time\\r\\nand attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher's time\\r\\nand attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing,\\r\\nand indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company\\r\\nmanners.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and\\r\\nDrummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and\\r\\nother instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian\\r\\nname was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy.\\r\\nIt further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the\\r\\ngarden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which\\r\\nher grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at all.\\r\\nDrummle didn't say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as a sulky\\r\\nkind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognized Mrs. Pocket\\r\\nas a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler the toady\\r\\nneighbor showed any interest in this part of the conversation, and it\\r\\nappeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but it promised to last\\r\\na long time, when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic\\r\\naffliction. It was, in effect, that the cook had mislaid the beef. To my\\r\\nunutterable amazement, I now, for the first time, saw Mr. Pocket\\r\\nrelieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very\\r\\nextraordinary, but which made no impression on anybody else, and\\r\\nwith which I soon became as familiar as the rest. He laid down the\\r\\ncarving-knife and fork,--being engaged in carving, at the moment,--put\\r\\nhis two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to make an\\r\\nextraordinary effort to lift himself up by it. When he had done this,\\r\\nand had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on with what he\\r\\nwas about.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me. I liked\\r\\nit for a few moments, but she flattered me so very grossly that the\\r\\npleasure was soon over. She had a serpentine way of coming close at\\r\\nme when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and\\r\\nlocalities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and\\r\\nwhen she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very little to\\r\\nher), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them for being on\\r\\nthe opposite side of the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made admiring\\r\\ncomments on their eyes, noses, and legs,--a sagacious way of improving\\r\\ntheir minds. There were four little girls, and two little boys, besides\\r\\nthe baby who might have been either, and the baby's next successor who\\r\\nwas as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and Millers, much as\\r\\nthough those two non-commissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere\\r\\nfor children and had enlisted these, while Mrs. Pocket looked at the\\r\\nyoung Nobles that ought to have been as if she rather thought she had\\r\\nhad the pleasure of inspecting them before, but didn't quite know what\\r\\nto make of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHere! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Flopson. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDon't\\r\\ntake it that way, or you'll get its head under the table.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head\\r\\nupon the table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious\\r\\nconcussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear, dear! Give it me back, Mum,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Flopson; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand Miss Jane, come\\r\\nand dance to baby, do!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely\\r\\ntaken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her place\\r\\nby me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and\\r\\nlaughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket (who in the\\r\\nmeantime had twice endeavored to lift himself up by the hair) laughed,\\r\\nand we all laughed and were glad.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll,\\r\\nthen got it safely into Mrs. Pocket's lap, and gave it the nut-crackers\\r\\nto play with; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice\\r\\nthat the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its\\r\\neyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same. Then, the\\r\\ntwo nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with\\r\\na dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly lost\\r\\nhalf his buttons at the gaming-table.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket's falling into a\\r\\ndiscussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a\\r\\nsliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the\\r\\nbaby on her lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers. At\\r\\nlength little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled, softly\\r\\nleft her place, and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous\\r\\nweapon away. Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the same time,\\r\\nand not approving of this, said to Jane,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMamma dear,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d lisped the little girl, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbaby ood have put hith eyeth\\r\\nout.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow dare you tell me so?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d retorted Mrs. Pocket. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGo and sit down in\\r\\nyour chair this moment!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Pocket's dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as if\\r\\nI myself had done something to rouse it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBelinda,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9chow can you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for the protection\\r\\nof baby.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI will not allow anybody to interfere,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Pocket. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am\\r\\nsurprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of\\r\\ninterference.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood God!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody to save\\r\\nthem?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI will not be interfered with by Jane,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Pocket, with a\\r\\nmajestic glance at that innocent little offender. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI hope I know my poor\\r\\ngrandpapa's position. Jane, indeed!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really did\\r\\nlift himself some inches out of his chair. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHear this!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he helplessly\\r\\nexclaimed to the elements. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBabies are to be nut-crackered dead, for\\r\\npeople's poor grandpapa's positions!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Then he let himself down again,\\r\\nand became silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on. A\\r\\npause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a\\r\\nseries of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be the\\r\\nonly member of the family (irrespective of servants) with whom it had\\r\\nany decided acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Drummle,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Pocket, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwill you ring for Flopson? Jane, you\\r\\nundutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come with\\r\\nma!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe baby was the soul of honor, and protested with all its might. It\\r\\ndoubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket's arm, exhibited a pair\\r\\nof knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft\\r\\nface, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And it gained\\r\\nits point after all, for I saw it through the window within a few\\r\\nminutes, being nursed by little Jane.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that the other five children were left behind at the\\r\\ndinner-table, through Flopson's having some private engagement, and\\r\\ntheir not being anybody else's business. I thus became aware of the\\r\\nmutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in\\r\\nthe following manner. Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his face\\r\\nheightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes, as if\\r\\nhe couldn't make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that\\r\\nestablishment, and why they hadn't been billeted by Nature on\\r\\nsomebody else. Then, in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain\\r\\nquestions,--as why little Joe had that hole in his frill, who said, Pa,\\r\\nFlopson was going to mend it when she had time,--and how little Fanny\\r\\ncame by that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it\\r\\nwhen she didn't forget. Then, he melted into parental tenderness, and\\r\\ngave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then as\\r\\nthey went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the\\r\\nhair he dismissed the hopeless subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and Startop had\\r\\neach a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. I was\\r\\npretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts, but as\\r\\nI was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,--not to say\\r\\nfor other waters,--I at once engaged to place myself under the tuition\\r\\nof the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and to whom I\\r\\nwas introduced by my new allies. This practical authority confused me\\r\\nvery much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith. If he could have\\r\\nknown how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil, I doubt if he would\\r\\nhave paid it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we\\r\\nshould all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable\\r\\ndomestic occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid\\r\\ncame in, and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSpeak to your master?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused\\r\\nagain. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to Flopson. Or\\r\\nspeak to me--at some other time.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBegging your pardon, ma'am,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the housemaid, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should wish to\\r\\nspeak at once, and to speak to master.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of\\r\\nourselves until he came back.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is a pretty thing, Belinda!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pocket, returning with a\\r\\ncountenance expressive of grief and despair. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHere's the cook lying\\r\\ninsensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh\\r\\nbutter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThis is\\r\\nthat odious Sophia's doing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean, Belinda?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d demanded Mr. Pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSophia has told you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Pocket. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDid I not see her with my own\\r\\neyes and hear her with my own ears, come into the room just now and ask\\r\\nto speak to you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut has she not taken me downstairs, Belinda,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Pocket,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cand shown me the woman, and the bundle too?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd do you defend her, Matthew,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Pocket, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor making\\r\\nmischief?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAm I, grandpapa's granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.\\r\\nPocket. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBesides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman,\\r\\nand said in the most natural manner when she came to look after the\\r\\nsituation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he dropped upon it in the\\r\\nattitude of the Dying Gladiator. Still in that attitude he said, with a\\r\\nhollow voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGood night, Mr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d when I deemed it advisable to go to\\r\\nbed and leave him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXIV\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter two or three days, when I had established myself in my room and\\r\\nhad gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and had ordered\\r\\nall I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk together.\\r\\nHe knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he referred\\r\\nto his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed for any\\r\\nprofession, and that I should be well enough educated for my destiny\\r\\nif I could Ã¢\\x80\\x9chold my ownÃ¢\\x80\\x9d with the average of young men in prosperous\\r\\ncircumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to the contrary.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition of\\r\\nsuch mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with the functions\\r\\nof explainer and director of all my studies. He hoped that with\\r\\nintelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me, and\\r\\nshould soon be able to dispense with any aid but his. Through his way\\r\\nof saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself on\\r\\nconfidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state\\r\\nat once that he was always so zealous and honorable in fulfilling his\\r\\ncompact with me, that he made me zealous and honorable in fulfilling\\r\\nmine with him. If he had shown indifference as a master, I have no doubt\\r\\nI should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me no such\\r\\nexcuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor did I ever regard\\r\\nhim as having anything ludicrous about him--or anything but what was\\r\\nserious, honest, and good--in his tutor communication with me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had\\r\\nbegun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my\\r\\nbedroom in Barnard's Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my\\r\\nmanners would be none the worse for Herbert's society. Mr. Pocket did\\r\\nnot object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could\\r\\npossibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt\\r\\nthat this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would\\r\\nsave Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted\\r\\nmy wish to Mr. Jaggers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf I could buy the furniture now hired for me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand one or two\\r\\nother little things, I should be quite at home there.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGo it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, with a short laugh. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI told you you'd get on.\\r\\nWell! How much do you want?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI said I didn't know how much.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCome!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d retorted Mr. Jaggers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow much? Fifty pounds?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO, not nearly so much.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFive pounds?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cO, more than\\r\\nthat.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMore than that, eh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d retorted Mr. Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with\\r\\nhis hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on the wall\\r\\nbehind me; Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow much more?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt is so difficult to fix a sum,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, hesitating.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCome!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet's get at it. Twice five; will that do?\\r\\nThree times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI said I thought that would do handsomely.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFour times five will do handsomely, will it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers,\\r\\nknitting his brows. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow, what do you make of four times five?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do I make of it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers; Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow much?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose you make it twenty pounds,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNever mind what I make it, my friend,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d observed Mr. Jaggers, with a\\r\\nknowing and contradictory toss of his head. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI want to know what you\\r\\nmake it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTwenty pounds, of course.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWemmick!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, opening his office door. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTake Mr. Pip's\\r\\nwritten order, and pay him twenty pounds.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked\\r\\nimpression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. Mr. Jaggers never\\r\\nlaughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poising\\r\\nhimself on these boots, with his large head bent down and his eyebrows\\r\\njoined together, awaiting an answer, he sometimes caused the boots to\\r\\ncreak, as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way. As he happened\\r\\nto go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said to Wemmick\\r\\nthat I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers's manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTell him that, and he'll take it as a compliment,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d answered Wemmick;\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9che don't mean that you should know what to make of it.--Oh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d for\\r\\nI looked surprised, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit's not personal; it's professional: only\\r\\nprofessional.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWemmick was at his desk, lunching--and crunching--on a dry hard biscuit;\\r\\npieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth, as\\r\\nif he were posting them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAlways seems to me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas if he had set a man-trap and was\\r\\nwatching it. Suddenly-click--you're caught!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life, I\\r\\nsaid I supposed he was very skilful?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDeep,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas Australia.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Pointing with his pen at the\\r\\noffice floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the purposes\\r\\nof the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf there was anything deeper,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d added Wemmick, bringing his pen to\\r\\npaper, Ã¢\\x80\\x9che'd be it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick said,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCa-pi-tal!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which he\\r\\nreplied,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe don't run much into clerks, because there's only one Jaggers, and\\r\\npeople won't have him at second hand. There are only four of us. Would\\r\\nyou like to see 'em? You are one of us, as I may say.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI accepted the offer. When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the\\r\\npost, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key\\r\\nof which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his\\r\\ncoat-collar like an iron-pigtail, we went upstairs. The house was dark\\r\\nand shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr.\\r\\nJaggers's room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase\\r\\nfor years. In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something\\r\\nbetween a publican and a rat-catcher--a large pale, puffed, swollen\\r\\nman--was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby\\r\\nappearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to\\r\\nbe treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers's coffers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGetting evidence\\r\\ntogether,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor the Bailey.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d In the\\r\\nroom over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair\\r\\n(his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) was\\r\\nsimilarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented\\r\\nto me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would melt\\r\\nme anything I pleased,--and who was in an excessive white-perspiration,\\r\\nas if he had been trying his art on himself. In a back room, a\\r\\nhigh-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was\\r\\ndressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been\\r\\nwaxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of\\r\\nthe other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers's own use.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was all the establishment. When we went downstairs again, Wemmick\\r\\nled me into my guardian's room, and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThis you've seen already.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPray,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them\\r\\ncaught my sight again, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhose likenesses are those?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThese?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off\\r\\nthe horrible heads before bringing them down. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThese are two celebrated\\r\\nones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. This chap\\r\\n(why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the\\r\\ninkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!) murdered\\r\\nhis master, and, considering that he wasn't brought up to evidence,\\r\\ndidn't plan it badly.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs it like him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat\\r\\nupon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLike him? It's himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate,\\r\\ndirectly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy for\\r\\nme, hadn't you, Old Artful?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick. He then explained this\\r\\naffectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the lady\\r\\nand the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHad it made for me, express!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs the lady anybody?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOnly his game. (You liked your bit of game,\\r\\ndidn't you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except\\r\\none,--and she wasn't of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn't\\r\\nhave caught her looking after this urn, unless there was something to\\r\\ndrink in it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Wemmick's attention being thus directed to his brooch, he\\r\\nput down the cast, and polished the brooch with his pocket-handkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid that other creature come to the same end?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe has the\\r\\nsame look.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou're right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit's the genuine look. Much as if one\\r\\nnostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook. Yes,\\r\\nhe came to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you.\\r\\nHe forged wills, this blade did, if he didn't also put the supposed\\r\\ntestators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, thoughÃ¢\\x80\\x9d (Mr.\\r\\nWemmick was again apostrophizing), Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand you said you could write Greek.\\r\\nYah, Bounceable! What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Before putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the\\r\\nlargest of his mourning rings and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSent out to buy it for me, only\\r\\nthe day before.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair,\\r\\nthe thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived\\r\\nfrom like sources. As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I\\r\\nventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood before\\r\\nme, dusting his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO yes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthese are all gifts of that kind. One brings\\r\\nanother, you see; that's the way of it. I always take 'em. They're\\r\\ncuriosities. And they're property. They may not be worth much, but,\\r\\nafter all, they're property and portable. It don't signify to you with\\r\\nyour brilliant lookout, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is,\\r\\n'Get hold of portable property'.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in a\\r\\nfriendly manner:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn't\\r\\nmind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and I\\r\\nshould consider it an honor. I have not much to show you; but such two\\r\\nor three curiosities as I have got you might like to look over; and I am\\r\\nfond of a bit of garden and a summer-house.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThankee,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthen we'll consider that it's to come off, when\\r\\nconvenient to you. Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot yet.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9che'll give you wine, and good wine. I'll give you\\r\\npunch, and not bad punch. And now I'll tell you something. When you go\\r\\nto dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his housekeeper.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShall I see something very uncommon?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou'll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very\\r\\nuncommon, you'll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original wildness\\r\\nof the beast, and the amount of taming. It won't lower your opinion of\\r\\nMr. Jaggers's powers. Keep your eye on it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that his\\r\\npreparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he asked me if I\\r\\nwould like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers Ã¢\\x80\\x9cat it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several reasons, and not least because I didn't clearly know what\\r\\nMr. Jaggers would be found to be Ã¢\\x80\\x9cat,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I replied in the affirmative.\\r\\nWe dived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court, where\\r\\na blood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the deceased, with the\\r\\nfanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably\\r\\nchewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination or\\r\\ncross-examination,--I don't know which,--and was striking her, and\\r\\nthe bench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever\\r\\ndegree, said a word that he didn't approve of, he instantly required to\\r\\nhave it Ã¢\\x80\\x9ctaken down.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d If anybody wouldn't make an admission, he said,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI'll have it out of you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and if anybody made an admission, he said,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow I have got you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The magistrates shivered under a single bite of\\r\\nhis finger. Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his words,\\r\\nand shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction. Which\\r\\nside he was on I couldn't make out, for he seemed to me to be grinding\\r\\nthe whole place in a mill; I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe,\\r\\nhe was not on the side of the bench; for, he was making the legs of the\\r\\nold gentleman who presided, quite convulsive under the table, by his\\r\\ndenunciations of his conduct as the representative of British law and\\r\\njustice in that chair that day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXV\\r\\n\\r\\nBentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book\\r\\nas if its writer had done him an injury, did not take up an\\r\\nacquaintance in a more agreeable spirit. Heavy in figure, movement,\\r\\nand comprehension,--in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in\\r\\nthe large, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as\\r\\nhe himself lolled about in a room,--he was idle, proud, niggardly,\\r\\nreserved, and suspicious. He came of rich people down in Somersetshire,\\r\\nwho had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the\\r\\ndiscovery that it was just of age and a blockhead. Thus, Bentley Drummle\\r\\nhad come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman,\\r\\nand half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen.\\r\\n\\r\\nStartop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he\\r\\nought to have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, and\\r\\nadmired her beyond measure. He had a woman's delicacy of feature,\\r\\nand was--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas you may see, though you never saw her,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert to\\r\\nme--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cexactly like his mother.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d It was but natural that I should take to\\r\\nhim much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliest\\r\\nevenings of our boating, he and I should pull homeward abreast of one\\r\\nanother, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up\\r\\nin our wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes. He\\r\\nwould always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature,\\r\\neven when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way; and I always\\r\\nthink of him as coming after us in the dark or by the back-water,\\r\\nwhen our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in\\r\\nmid-stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert was my intimate companion and friend. I presented him with a\\r\\nhalf-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his often coming down\\r\\nto Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his chambers often\\r\\ntook me up to London. We used to walk between the two places at all\\r\\nhours. I have an affection for the road yet (though it is not so\\r\\npleasant a road as it was then), formed in the impressibility of untried\\r\\nyouth and hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had been in Mr. Pocket's family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nCamilla turned up. Camilla was Mr. Pocket's sister. Georgiana, whom I\\r\\nhad seen at Miss Havisham's on the same occasion, also turned up. She\\r\\nwas a cousin,--an indigestive single woman, who called her rigidity\\r\\nreligion, and her liver love. These people hated me with the hatred of\\r\\ncupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon\\r\\nme in my prosperity with the basest meanness. Towards Mr. Pocket, as\\r\\na grown-up infant with no notion of his own interests, they showed the\\r\\ncomplacent forbearance I had heard them express. Mrs. Pocket they\\r\\nheld in contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily\\r\\ndisappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon\\r\\nthemselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied\\r\\nmyself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and began\\r\\nto spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should have\\r\\nthought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my books.\\r\\nThere was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to feel\\r\\nmy deficiencies. Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast; and, with\\r\\none or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted, and\\r\\nclear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as great a dolt as\\r\\nDrummle if I had done less.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write\\r\\nhim a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening. He\\r\\nreplied that it would give him much pleasure, and that he would expect\\r\\nme at the office at six o'clock. Thither I went, and there I found him,\\r\\nputting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid you think of walking down to Walworth?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCertainly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif you approve.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery much,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d was Wemmick's reply, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor I have had my legs under the desk\\r\\nall day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, I'll tell you what I\\r\\nhave got for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak,--which is\\r\\nof home preparation,--and a cold roast fowl,--which is from the\\r\\ncook's-shop. I think it's tender, because the master of the shop was a\\r\\nJuryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy.\\r\\nI reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPick us out\\r\\na good one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box\\r\\nanother day or two, we could easily have done it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He said to that,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLet me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I let him, of\\r\\ncourse. As far as it goes, it's property and portable. You don't object\\r\\nto an aged parent, I hope?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause I have got an aged parent at my place.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I then said what\\r\\npoliteness required.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo, you haven't dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he pursued, as we walked\\r\\nalong.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot yet.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming. I expect\\r\\nyou'll have an invitation to-morrow. He's going to ask your pals, too.\\r\\nThree of 'em; ain't there?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my\\r\\nintimate associates, I answered, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, he's going to ask the whole gang,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d--I hardly felt complimented by\\r\\nthe word,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand whatever he gives you, he'll give you good. Don't look\\r\\nforward to variety, but you'll have excellence. And there's another rum\\r\\nthing in his house,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d proceeded Wemmick, after a moment's pause, as if\\r\\nthe remark followed on the housekeeper understood; Ã¢\\x80\\x9che never lets a door\\r\\nor window be fastened at night.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs he never robbed?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe says, and gives it out publicly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nwant to see the man who'll rob me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Lord bless you, I have heard him, a\\r\\nhundred times, if I have heard him once, say to regular cracksmen in our\\r\\nfront office, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn there;\\r\\nwhy don't you do a stroke of business with me? Come; can't I tempt you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on, for love or\\r\\nmoney.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey dread him so much?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDread him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI believe you they dread him. Not but what\\r\\nhe's artful, even in his defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britannia\\r\\nmetal, every spoon.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo they wouldn't have much,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I observed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ceven if they--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh! But he would have much,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, cutting me short, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand they\\r\\nknow it. He'd have their lives, and the lives of scores of 'em. He'd\\r\\nhave all he could get. And it's impossible to say what he couldn't get,\\r\\nif he gave his mind to it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was falling into meditation on my guardian's greatness, when Wemmick\\r\\nremarked:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs to the absence of plate, that's only his natural depth, you know.\\r\\nA river's its natural depth, and he's his natural depth. Look at his\\r\\nwatch-chain. That's real enough.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's very massive,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMassive?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think so. And his watch is a gold\\r\\nrepeater, and worth a hundred pound if it's worth a penny. Mr. Pip,\\r\\nthere are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about\\r\\nthat watch; there's not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who\\r\\nwouldn't identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it\\r\\nwas red hot, if inveigled into touching it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a more\\r\\ngeneral nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road,\\r\\nuntil he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of\\r\\nWalworth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and little\\r\\ngardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement.\\r\\nWemmick's house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of\\r\\ngarden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted\\r\\nwith guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy own doing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLooks pretty; don't it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw;\\r\\nwith the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of them sham),\\r\\nand a gothic door almost too small to get in at.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's a real flagstaff, you see,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand on Sundays I\\r\\nrun up a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I\\r\\nhoist it up--so--and cut off the communication.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide\\r\\nand two deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he\\r\\nhoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he did so, with a relish and\\r\\nnot merely mechanically.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt nine o'clock every night, Greenwich time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe gun\\r\\nfires. There he is, you see! And when you hear him go, I think you'll\\r\\nsay he's a Stinger.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress,\\r\\nconstructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an\\r\\ningenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen, at the back,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cout of sight, so as not to impede\\r\\nthe idea of fortifications,--for it's a principle with me, if you have\\r\\nan idea, carry it out and keep it up,--I don't know whether that's your\\r\\nopinion--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI said, decidedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c--At the back, there's a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then,\\r\\nI knock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and\\r\\nyou'll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nWemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif you\\r\\ncan suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of a\\r\\ntime in point of provisions.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was\\r\\napproached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long\\r\\ntime to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth.\\r\\nOur punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower\\r\\nwas raised. This piece of water (with an island in the middle which\\r\\nmight have been the salad for supper) was of a circular form, and he had\\r\\nconstructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill going\\r\\nand took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent that it\\r\\nmade the back of your hand quite wet.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and\\r\\nmy own gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, in\\r\\nacknowledging my compliments. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell; it's a good thing, you know. It\\r\\nbrushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged. You wouldn't\\r\\nmind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you? It wouldn't put\\r\\nyou out?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle. There\\r\\nwe found, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean,\\r\\ncheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell aged parent,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a cordial\\r\\nand jocose way, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow am you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAll right, John; all right!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied the old man.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHere's Mr. Pip, aged parent,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I wish you could hear\\r\\nhis name. Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that's what he likes. Nod away at\\r\\nhim, if you please, like winking!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is a fine place of my son's, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried the old man, while I\\r\\nnodded as hard as I possibly could. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThis is a pretty pleasure-ground,\\r\\nsir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept\\r\\ntogether by the Nation, after my son's time, for the people's\\r\\nenjoyment.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou're as proud of it as Punch; ain't you, Aged?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick,\\r\\ncontemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthere's\\r\\na nod for you;Ã¢\\x80\\x9d giving him a tremendous one; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthere's another for you;Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n giving him a still more tremendous one; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou like that, don't you? If\\r\\nyou're not tired, Mr. Pip--though I know it's tiring to strangers--will\\r\\nyou tip him one more? You can't think how it pleases him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits. We left him\\r\\nbestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in\\r\\nthe arbor; where Wemmick told me, as he smoked a pipe, that it had taken\\r\\nhim a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of\\r\\nperfection.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs it your own, Mr. Wemmick?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO yes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It's a\\r\\nfreehold, by George!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs it indeed? I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNever seen it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNever heard of it. Never seen the Aged.\\r\\nNever heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life is\\r\\nanother. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and\\r\\nwhen I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it's not\\r\\nin any way disagreeable to you, you'll oblige me by doing the same. I\\r\\ndon't wish it professionally spoken about.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his\\r\\nrequest. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and\\r\\ntalking, until it was almost nine o'clock. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGetting near gun-fire,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nWemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit's the Aged's treat.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nProceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,\\r\\nwith expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great\\r\\nnightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the\\r\\nmoment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and\\r\\nrepair to the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently the\\r\\nStinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a\\r\\ncottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup in\\r\\nit ring. Upon this, the Aged--who I believe would have been blown out\\r\\nof his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows--cried out exultingly,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe's fired! I heerd him!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and I nodded at the old gentleman until it is\\r\\nno figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing\\r\\nme his collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious\\r\\ncharacter; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been\\r\\ncommitted, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and several\\r\\nmanuscript confessions written under condemnation,--upon which Mr.\\r\\nWemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cevery one\\r\\nof 'em Lies, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d These were agreeably dispersed among small specimens\\r\\nof china and glass, various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the\\r\\nmuseum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged. They were all\\r\\ndisplayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had been first\\r\\ninducted, and which served, not only as the general sitting-room but\\r\\nas the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob, and\\r\\na brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a\\r\\nroasting-jack.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged in\\r\\nthe day. When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered to\\r\\ngive her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night. The supper was\\r\\nexcellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot insomuch\\r\\nthat it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have been\\r\\nfarther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment. Nor was\\r\\nthere any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there being such\\r\\na very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when I lay down\\r\\non my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my\\r\\nforehead all night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him\\r\\ncleaning my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from\\r\\nmy gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in\\r\\na most devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at\\r\\nhalf-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees,\\r\\nWemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened\\r\\ninto a post-office again. At last, when we got to his place of business\\r\\nand he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked as unconscious\\r\\nof his Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the\\r\\narbor and the lake and the fountain and the Aged, had all been blown\\r\\ninto space together by the last discharge of the Stinger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXVI\\r\\n\\r\\nIt fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early\\r\\nopportunity of comparing my guardian's establishment with that of his\\r\\ncashier and clerk. My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with\\r\\nhis scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he\\r\\ncalled me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends\\r\\nwhich Wemmick had prepared me to receive. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo ceremony,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he stipulated,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cand no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked him where we should\\r\\ncome to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in his\\r\\ngeneral objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCome here, and I'll take you home with me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I embrace this opportunity\\r\\nof remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or\\r\\na dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose, which\\r\\nsmelt of the scented soap like a perfumer's shop. It had an unusually\\r\\nlarge jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would wash his\\r\\nhands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel, whenever he came\\r\\nin from a police court or dismissed a client from his room. When I and\\r\\nmy friends repaired to him at six o'clock next day, he seemed to have\\r\\nbeen engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual, for we found\\r\\nhim with his head butted into this closet, not only washing his hands,\\r\\nbut laving his face and gargling his throat. And even when he had\\r\\ndone all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel, he took out his\\r\\npenknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat\\r\\non.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into\\r\\nthe street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there was\\r\\nsomething so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled\\r\\nhis presence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along\\r\\nwestward, he was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of\\r\\nthe streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but\\r\\nhe never otherwise recognized anybody, or took notice that anybody\\r\\nrecognized him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side of\\r\\nthat street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in want\\r\\nof painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and opened the\\r\\ndoor, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and little used.\\r\\nSo, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on\\r\\nthe first floor. There were carved garlands on the panelled walls, and\\r\\nas he stood among them giving us welcome, I know what kind of loops I\\r\\nthought they looked like.\\r\\n\\r\\nDinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his\\r\\ndressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the whole\\r\\nhouse, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was comfortably\\r\\nlaid--no silver in the service, of course--and at the side of his chair\\r\\nwas a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and decanters on\\r\\nit, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed throughout, that he\\r\\nkept everything under his own hand, and distributed everything himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,\\r\\nthat they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography, trials,\\r\\nacts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very solid\\r\\nand good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however, and\\r\\nthere was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a little\\r\\ntable of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring the\\r\\noffice home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an\\r\\nevening and fall to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,--for he and I had\\r\\nwalked together,--he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,\\r\\nand took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to\\r\\nbe principally if not solely interested in Drummle.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to\\r\\nthe window, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't know one from the other. Who's the Spider?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe spider?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's Bentley Drummle,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I replied; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe one with the delicate face is\\r\\nStartop.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNot making the least account of Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe one with the delicate face,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nreturned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of that\\r\\nfellow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his\\r\\nreplying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to screw\\r\\ndiscourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came between\\r\\nme and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a woman of about forty, I supposed,--but I may have thought her\\r\\nyounger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely\\r\\npale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot\\r\\nsay whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be\\r\\nparted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious expression\\r\\nof suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at\\r\\nthe theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked to me as if\\r\\nit were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had seen rise out\\r\\nof the Witches' caldron.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a\\r\\nfinger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats\\r\\nat the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,\\r\\nwhile Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the\\r\\nhousekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice\\r\\nmutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all\\r\\nthe accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our\\r\\nhost from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the\\r\\ntable, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean\\r\\nplates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just\\r\\ndisused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant\\r\\nthan the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw\\r\\nin her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made\\r\\na dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other\\r\\nnatural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass\\r\\nbehind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.\\r\\n\\r\\nInduced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her\\r\\nown striking appearance and by Wemmick's preparation, I observed\\r\\nthat whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my\\r\\nguardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put\\r\\nbefore him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and\\r\\nwanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I\\r\\nfancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and a\\r\\npurpose of always holding her in suspense.\\r\\n\\r\\nDinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather\\r\\nthan originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of\\r\\nour dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing my\\r\\ntendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronize Herbert, and to boast\\r\\nof my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my lips.\\r\\nIt was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the\\r\\ndevelopment of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious\\r\\nway at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our\\r\\nconversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied\\r\\nfor coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.\\r\\nDrummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to\\r\\nour company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that\\r\\nas to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible agency,\\r\\nmy guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this\\r\\ntrifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular\\r\\nit was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous\\r\\nmanner.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,\\r\\ntaking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,\\r\\nwas leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and\\r\\nshowing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.\\r\\nSuddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper's, like a trap,\\r\\nas she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do\\r\\nthis, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you talk of strength,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'll show you a wrist.\\r\\nMolly, let them see your wrist.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other\\r\\nhand behind her waist. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMaster,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, in a low voice, with her eyes\\r\\nattentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDon't.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI'll show you a wrist,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable\\r\\ndetermination to show it. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMolly, let them see your wrist.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMaster,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she again murmured. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPlease!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMolly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking\\r\\nat the opposite side of the room, Ã¢\\x80\\x9clet them see both your wrists. Show\\r\\nthem. Come!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She\\r\\nbrought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by\\r\\nside. The last wrist was much disfigured,--deeply scarred and scarred\\r\\nacross and across. When she held her hands out she took her eyes from\\r\\nMr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us\\r\\nin succession.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere's power here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews\\r\\nwith his forefinger. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cVery few men have the power of wrist that this\\r\\nwoman has. It's remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these\\r\\nhands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw\\r\\nstronger in that respect, man's or woman's, than these.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continued\\r\\nto look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment\\r\\nhe ceased, she looked at him again. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThat'll do, Molly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr.\\r\\nJaggers, giving her a slight nod; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou have been admired, and can\\r\\ngo.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,\\r\\nputting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his glass and\\r\\npassed round the wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt half-past nine, gentlemen,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe must break up. Pray make\\r\\nthe best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I\\r\\ndrink to you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIf his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more,\\r\\nit perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose\\r\\ndepreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,\\r\\nuntil he became downright intolerable. Through all his stages, Mr.\\r\\nJaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He actually seemed\\r\\nto serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers's wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,\\r\\nand I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some\\r\\nboorish sneer of Drummle's, to the effect that we were too free with our\\r\\nmoney. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that it\\r\\ncame with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my\\r\\npresence but a week or so before.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d retorted Drummle; Ã¢\\x80\\x9che'll be paid.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't mean to imply that he won't,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut it might make you\\r\\nhold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou should think!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d retorted Drummle. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh Lord!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI dare say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I went on, meaning to be very severe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat you wouldn't\\r\\nlend money to any of us if we wanted it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Drummle. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wouldn't lend one of you a sixpence. I\\r\\nwouldn't lend anybody a sixpence.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou should say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated Drummle. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh Lord!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was so very aggravating--the more especially as I found myself\\r\\nmaking no way against his surly obtuseness--that I said, disregarding\\r\\nHerbert's efforts to check me,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCome, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I'll tell you what\\r\\npassed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n growled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might\\r\\nboth go to the devil and shake ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI'll tell you, however,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhether you want to know or not. We\\r\\nsaid that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed\\r\\nto be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDrummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands\\r\\nin his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that\\r\\nit was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.\\r\\n\\r\\nHereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than\\r\\nI had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop,\\r\\nbeing a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact\\r\\nopposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct\\r\\npersonal affront. He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop\\r\\ntried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made\\r\\nus all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything, Drummle,\\r\\nwithout any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his pockets,\\r\\ndropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and would\\r\\nhave flung it at his adversary's head, but for our entertainer's\\r\\ndexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that\\r\\npurpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGentlemen,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and\\r\\nhauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am exceedingly\\r\\nsorry to announce that it's half past nine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,\\r\\nStartop was cheerily calling Drummle Ã¢\\x80\\x9cold boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d as if nothing had\\r\\nhappened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not\\r\\neven walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,\\r\\nwho remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;\\r\\nStartop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses,\\r\\nmuch as he was wont to follow in his boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for\\r\\na moment, and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian. I found\\r\\nhim in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots, already hard\\r\\nat it, washing his hands of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nI told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything\\r\\ndisagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blame\\r\\nme much.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPooh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the\\r\\nwater-drops; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit's nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing, and\\r\\ntowelling himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am glad you like him, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I don't.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d my guardian assented; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdon't have too much to do with him.\\r\\nKeep as clear of him as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip; he is one\\r\\nof the true sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking out of the towel, he caught my eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut I am not a fortune-teller,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, letting his head drop into a\\r\\nfestoon of towel, and towelling away at his two ears. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou know what I\\r\\nam, don't you? Good night, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood night, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn about a month after that, the Spider's time with Mr. Pocket was up\\r\\nfor good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket, he\\r\\nwent home to the family hole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXVII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMY DEAR MR PIP:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI write this by request of Mr. Gargery, for to let you know that he\\r\\nis going to London in company with Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if\\r\\nagreeable to be allowed to see you. He would call at Barnard's Hotel\\r\\nTuesday morning at nine o'clock, when if not agreeable please leave\\r\\nword. Your poor sister is much the same as when you left. We talk of you\\r\\nin the kitchen every night, and wonder what you are saying and doing. If\\r\\nnow considered in the light of a liberty, excuse it for the love of\\r\\npoor old days. No more, dear Mr. Pip, from your ever obliged, and\\r\\naffectionate servant,\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBIDDY.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cP.S. He wishes me most particular to write what larks. He says you will\\r\\nunderstand. I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him,\\r\\neven though a gentleman, for you had ever a good heart, and he is a\\r\\nworthy, worthy man. I have read him all, excepting only the last little\\r\\nsentence, and he wishes me most particular to write again what larks.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its\\r\\nappointment was for next day. Let me confess exactly with what feelings\\r\\nI looked forward to Joe's coming.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties; no;\\r\\nwith considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of\\r\\nincongruity. If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainly\\r\\nwould have paid money. My greatest reassurance was that he was coming\\r\\nto Barnard's Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall\\r\\nin Bentley Drummle's way. I had little objection to his being seen by\\r\\nHerbert or his father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the\\r\\nsharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle, whom I held in\\r\\ncontempt. So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are\\r\\nusually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite\\r\\nunnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those\\r\\nwrestles with Barnard proved to be. By this time, the rooms were\\r\\nvastly different from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honor\\r\\nof occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighboring\\r\\nupholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a boy\\r\\nin boots,--top boots,--in bondage and slavery to whom I might have been\\r\\nsaid to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster (out of the\\r\\nrefuse of my washerwoman's family), and had clothed him with a blue\\r\\ncoat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots\\r\\nalready mentioned, I had to find him a little to do and a great deal\\r\\nto eat; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my\\r\\nexistence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday\\r\\nmorning in the hall, (it was two feet square, as charged for\\r\\nfloorcloth,) and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he\\r\\nthought Joe would like. While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being\\r\\nso interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked sense of\\r\\nsuspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see him, he wouldn't\\r\\nhave been quite so brisk about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, and\\r\\nI got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and\\r\\nbreakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately\\r\\nthe morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact\\r\\nthat Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some weak\\r\\ngiant of a Sweep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger\\r\\npursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on\\r\\nthe staircase. I knew it was Joe, by his clumsy manner of coming upstairs,\\r\\n--his state boots being always too big for him,--and by the time\\r\\nit took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of\\r\\nhis ascent. When at last he stopped outside our door, I could hear his\\r\\nfinger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwards\\r\\ndistinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole. Finally he gave a\\r\\nfaint single rap, and Pepper--such was the compromising name of the\\r\\navenging boy--announced Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Gargery!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I thought he never would have\\r\\ndone wiping his feet, and that I must have gone out to lift him off the\\r\\nmat, but at last he came in.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cJoe, how are you, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPip, how AIR you, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith his good honest face all glowing and shining, and his hat put\\r\\ndown on the floor between us, he caught both my hands and worked them\\r\\nstraight up and down, as if I had been the last-patented Pump.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am glad to see you, Joe. Give me your hat.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird's-nest with\\r\\neggs in it, wouldn't hear of parting with that piece of property, and\\r\\npersisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich you have that growed,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand that swelled, and that\\r\\ngentle-folked;Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe considered a little before he discovered this word;\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cas to be sure you are a honor to your king and country.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd you, Joe, look wonderfully well.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThank God,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'm ekerval to most. And your sister, she's\\r\\nno worse than she were. And Biddy, she's ever right and ready. And all\\r\\nfriends is no backerder, if not no forarder. 'Ceptin Wopsle; he's had a\\r\\ndrop.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this time (still with both hands taking great care of the\\r\\nbird's-nest), Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room, and\\r\\nround and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHad a drop, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy yes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, lowering his voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9che's left the Church and went\\r\\ninto the playacting. Which the playacting have likeways brought him\\r\\nto London along with me. And his wish were,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, getting the\\r\\nbird's-nest under his left arm for the moment, and groping in it for an\\r\\negg with his right; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif no offence, as I would 'and you that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of\\r\\na small metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that\\r\\nvery week, of Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown,\\r\\nwhose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National Bard\\r\\nhas lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWere you at his performance, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI were,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWas there a great sensation?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel.\\r\\nPartickler when he see the ghost. Though I put it to yourself, sir,\\r\\nwhether it were calc'lated to keep a man up to his work with a good\\r\\nhart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAmen!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d A man may have had a misfortun' and been in the Church,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nJoe, lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut\\r\\nthat is no reason why you should put him out at such a time. Which I\\r\\nmeantersay, if the ghost of a man's own father cannot be allowed to\\r\\nclaim his attention, what can, Sir? Still more, when his mourning 'at\\r\\nis unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers\\r\\nbrings it off, try to keep it on how you may.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA ghost-seeing effect in Joe's own countenance informed me that Herbert\\r\\nhad entered the room. So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his\\r\\nhand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird's-nest.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYour servant, Sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhich I hope as you and PipÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--here his\\r\\neye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so\\r\\nplainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the\\r\\nfamily, that I frowned it down and confused him more--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI meantersay, you\\r\\ntwo gentlemen,--which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot?\\r\\nFor the present may be a werry good inn, according to London opinions,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Joe, confidentially, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I believe its character do stand it; but I\\r\\nwouldn't keep a pig in it myself,--not in the case that I wished him to\\r\\nfatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavor on him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our\\r\\ndwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9csir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the\\r\\nroom for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat,--as if it were\\r\\nonly on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a\\r\\nresting place,--and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the\\r\\nchimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Herbert, who always\\r\\npresided of a morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThankee, Sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, stiff from head to foot, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'll take whichever\\r\\nis most agreeable to yourself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you say to coffee?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThankee, Sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9csince you are so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run contrairy\\r\\nto your own opinions. But don't you never find it a little 'eating?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSay tea then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, pouring it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Joe's hat tumbled off the mantel-piece, and he started out of his\\r\\nchair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot. As if it\\r\\nwere an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again\\r\\nsoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWere it yesterday afternoon?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, after coughing behind his hand,\\r\\nas if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo\\r\\nit were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoonÃ¢\\x80\\x9d (with an\\r\\nappearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality).\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you seen anything of London yet?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, yes, Sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cme and Wopsle went off straight to look at\\r\\nthe Blacking Ware'us. But we didn't find that it come up to its likeness\\r\\nin the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d added Joe, in\\r\\nan explanatory manner, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas it is there drawd too architectooralooral.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI really believe Joe would have prolonged this word (mightily expressive\\r\\nto my mind of some architecture that I know) into a perfect Chorus, but\\r\\nfor his attention being providentially attracted by his hat, which\\r\\nwas toppling. Indeed, it demanded from him a constant attention, and a\\r\\nquickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted by wicket-keeping.\\r\\nHe made extraordinary play with it, and showed the greatest skill; now,\\r\\nrushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped; now, merely stopping\\r\\nit midway, beating it up, and humoring it in various parts of the room\\r\\nand against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall,\\r\\nbefore he felt it safe to close with it; finally splashing it into the\\r\\nslop-basin, where I took the liberty of laying hands upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to his shirt-collar, and his coat-collar, they were perplexing to\\r\\nreflect upon,--insoluble mysteries both. Why should a man scrape himself\\r\\nto that extent, before he could consider himself full dressed? Why\\r\\nshould he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for\\r\\nhis holiday clothes? Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of\\r\\nmeditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth; had\\r\\nhis eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such\\r\\nremarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much\\r\\nmore than he ate, and pretended that he hadn't dropped it; that I was\\r\\nheartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was\\r\\nall my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would have\\r\\nbeen easier with me. I felt impatient of him and out of temper with him;\\r\\nin which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUs two being now alone, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d--began Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cJoe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I interrupted, pettishly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow can you call me, sir?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like\\r\\nreproach. Utterly preposterous as his cravat was, and as his collars\\r\\nwere, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUs two being now alone,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d resumed Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand me having the intentions and\\r\\nabilities to stay not many minutes more, I will now conclude--leastways\\r\\nbegin--to mention what have led to my having had the present honor. For\\r\\nwas it not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, with his old air of lucid exposition, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat my\\r\\nonly wish were to be useful to you, I should not have had the honor of\\r\\nbreaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlemen.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstrance\\r\\nagainst this tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pursued Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthis is how it were. I were at the Bargemen\\r\\nt'other night, Pip;Ã¢\\x80\\x9d--whenever he subsided into affection, he called me\\r\\nPip, and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhen\\r\\nthere come up in his shay-cart, Pumblechook. Which that same identical,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Joe, going down a new track, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdo comb my 'air the wrong way\\r\\nsometimes, awful, by giving out up and down town as it were him which\\r\\never had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a playfellow\\r\\nby yourself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNonsense. It was you, Joe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich I fully believed it were, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, slightly tossing\\r\\nhis head, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthough it signify little now, sir. Well, Pip; this same\\r\\nidentical, which his manners is given to blusterous, come to me at\\r\\nthe Bargemen (wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the\\r\\nworkingman, sir, and do not over stimilate), and his word were, 'Joseph,\\r\\nMiss Havisham she wish to speak to you.'Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss Havisham, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c'She wish,' were Pumblechook's word, 'to speak to you.'Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe sat and\\r\\nrolled his eyes at the ceiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Joe? Go on, please.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNext day, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9chaving cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss A., Joe? Miss Havisham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich I say, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if\\r\\nhe were making his will, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMiss A., or otherways Havisham. Her expression\\r\\nair then as follering: 'Mr. Gargery. You air in correspondence with Mr.\\r\\nPip?' Having had a letter from you, I were able to say 'I am.' (When\\r\\nI married your sister, sir, I said 'I will;' and when I answered your\\r\\nfriend, Pip, I said 'I am.') 'Would you tell him, then,' said she, 'that\\r\\nwhich Estella has come home and would be glad to see him.'Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe. I hope one remote cause\\r\\nof its firing may have been my consciousness that if I had known his\\r\\nerrand, I should have given him more encouragement.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pursued Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhen I got home and asked her fur to write the\\r\\nmessage to you, a little hung back. Biddy says, 'I know he will be very\\r\\nglad to have it by word of mouth, it is holiday time, you want to see\\r\\nhim, go!' I have now concluded, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, rising from his chair,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cand, Pip, I wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a\\r\\ngreater height.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut you are not going now, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes I am,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut you are coming back to dinner, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo I am not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur eyes met, and all the Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSirÃ¢\\x80\\x9d melted out of that manly heart as he gave\\r\\nme his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings welded\\r\\ntogether, as I may say, and one man's a blacksmith, and one's a\\r\\nwhitesmith, and one's a goldsmith, and one's a coppersmith. Diwisions\\r\\namong such must come, and must be met as they come. If there's been\\r\\nany fault at all to-day, it's mine. You and me is not two figures to\\r\\nbe together in London; nor yet anywheres else but what is private, and\\r\\nbeknown, and understood among friends. It ain't that I am proud, but\\r\\nthat I want to be right, as you shall never see me no more in these\\r\\nclothes. I'm wrong in these clothes. I'm wrong out of the forge, the\\r\\nkitchen, or off th' meshes. You won't find half so much fault in me if\\r\\nyou think of me in my forge dress, with my hammer in my hand, or even\\r\\nmy pipe. You won't find half so much fault in me if, supposing as you\\r\\nshould ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forge\\r\\nwindow and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in the old\\r\\nburnt apron, sticking to the old work. I'm awful dull, but I hope I've\\r\\nbeat out something nigh the rights of this at last. And so GOD bless\\r\\nyou, dear old Pip, old chap, GOD bless you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity\\r\\nin him. The fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he\\r\\nspoke these words than it could come in its way in Heaven. He touched me\\r\\ngently on the forehead, and went out. As soon as I could recover\\r\\nmyself sufficiently, I hurried out after him and looked for him in the\\r\\nneighboring streets; but he was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the first\\r\\nflow of my repentance, it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe's.\\r\\nBut, when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow's coach, and had been\\r\\ndown to Mr. Pocket's and back, I was not by any means convinced on the\\r\\nlast point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting\\r\\nup at the Blue Boar. I should be an inconvenience at Joe's; I was not\\r\\nexpected, and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from\\r\\nMiss Havisham's, and she was exacting and mightn't like it. All other\\r\\nswindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers, and with such\\r\\npretences did I cheat myself. Surely a curious thing. That I should\\r\\ninnocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else's manufacture is\\r\\nreasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin\\r\\nof my own make as good money! An obliging stranger, under pretence of\\r\\ncompactly folding up my bank-notes for security's sake, abstracts the\\r\\nnotes and gives me nutshells; but what is his sleight of hand to mine,\\r\\nwhen I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was much\\r\\ndisturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger. It was\\r\\ntempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots\\r\\nin the archway of the Blue Boar's posting-yard; it was almost solemn to\\r\\nimagine him casually produced in the tailor's shop, and confounding\\r\\nthe disrespectful senses of Trabb's boy. On the other hand, Trabb's boy\\r\\nmight worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or, reckless\\r\\nand desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the High\\r\\nStreet. My patroness, too, might hear of him, and not approve. On the\\r\\nwhole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as winter\\r\\nhad now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until two or\\r\\nthree hours after dark. Our time of starting from the Cross Keys was\\r\\ntwo o'clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare,\\r\\nattended by the Avenger,--if I may connect that expression with one who\\r\\nnever attended on me if he could possibly help it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards\\r\\nby stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside\\r\\npassengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling\\r\\ntheir ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised\\r\\nwhen Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were two\\r\\nconvicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old reason\\r\\nnow for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word Ã¢\\x80\\x9cconvict.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou don't mind them, Handel?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO no!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI thought you seemed as if you didn't like them?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI can't pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don't\\r\\nparticularly. But I don't mind them.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSee! There they are,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccoming out of the Tap. What a\\r\\ndegraded and vile sight it is!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler\\r\\nwith them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.\\r\\nThe two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their\\r\\nlegs,--irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I\\r\\nlikewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried\\r\\na thick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good\\r\\nunderstanding with them, and stood with them beside him, looking on at\\r\\nthe putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts were\\r\\nan interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he the\\r\\nCurator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and appeared\\r\\nas a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the world,\\r\\nboth convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of\\r\\nclothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes,\\r\\nand his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his half-closed eye\\r\\nat one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen on the settle at the\\r\\nThree Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had brought me down\\r\\nwith his invisible gun!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had\\r\\nnever seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye appraised\\r\\nmy watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said something to the\\r\\nother convict, and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink\\r\\nof their coupling manacle, and looked at something else. The great\\r\\nnumbers on their backs, as if they were street doors; their coarse mangy\\r\\nungainly outer surface, as if they were lower animals; their ironed\\r\\nlegs, apologetically garlanded with pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way\\r\\nin which all present looked at them and kept from them; made them (as\\r\\nHerbert had said) a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the back\\r\\nof the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and that\\r\\nthere were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front\\r\\nbehind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had taken the\\r\\nfourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion, and said\\r\\nthat it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous\\r\\ncompany, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and infamous, and\\r\\nshameful, and I don't know what else. At this time the coach was ready\\r\\nand the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing to get up, and\\r\\nthe prisoners had come over with their keeper,--bringing with them that\\r\\ncurious flavor of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and hearthstone,\\r\\nwhich attends the convict presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDon't take it so much amiss, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pleaded the keeper to the angry\\r\\npassenger; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'll sit next you myself. I'll put 'em on the outside of\\r\\nthe row. They won't interfere with you, sir. You needn't know they're\\r\\nthere.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd don't blame me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d growled the convict I had recognized. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't\\r\\nwant to go. I am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am concerned\\r\\nany one's welcome to my place.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOr mine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the other, gruffly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wouldn't have incommoded none\\r\\nof you, if I'd had my way.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Then they both laughed, and began cracking\\r\\nnuts, and spitting the shells about.--As I really think I should have\\r\\nliked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so despised.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman,\\r\\nand that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind. So he\\r\\ngot into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into the\\r\\nplace next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they\\r\\ncould, and the convict I had recognized sat behind me with his breath on\\r\\nthe hair of my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood-bye, Handel!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Herbert called out as we started. I thought what a\\r\\nblessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict's\\r\\nbreathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The\\r\\nsensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and\\r\\nsearching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have more\\r\\nbreathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in\\r\\ndoing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side, in\\r\\nmy shrinking endeavors to fend him off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us\\r\\nall lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way\\r\\nHouse behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed\\r\\noff, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a\\r\\ncouple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him,\\r\\nand how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I\\r\\nwere going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the\\r\\nquestion up again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although\\r\\nI could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and\\r\\nshadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that\\r\\nblew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against\\r\\nthe wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first\\r\\nwords I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of\\r\\nmy own thought, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTwo One Pound notes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow did he get 'em?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the convict I had never seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow should I know?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the other. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe had 'em stowed away\\r\\nsomehows. Giv him by friends, I expect.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wish,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat I had\\r\\n'em here.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTwo one pound notes, or friends?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTwo one pound notes. I'd sell all the friends I ever had for one, and\\r\\nthink it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says--?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo he says,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d resumed the convict I had recognized,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit was all\\r\\nsaid and done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the\\r\\nDock-yard,--'You're a going to be discharged?' Yes, I was. Would I find\\r\\nout that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two\\r\\none pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMore fool you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d growled the other. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'd have spent 'em on a Man, in\\r\\nwittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowed\\r\\nnothing of you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot a ha'porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried again\\r\\nfor prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd was that--Honor!--the only time you worked out, in this part of the\\r\\ncountry?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe only time.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat might have been your opinion of the place?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp,\\r\\nmist, and mudbank.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually\\r\\ngrowled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and\\r\\nbeen left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling\\r\\ncertain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not\\r\\nonly so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and\\r\\nso differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could\\r\\nhave known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our\\r\\nbeing together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a\\r\\ndread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in his\\r\\nhearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as soon as\\r\\nwe touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. This device I\\r\\nexecuted successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot under my\\r\\nfeet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down before\\r\\nme, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the first\\r\\nstones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their way\\r\\nwith the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off to\\r\\nthe river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for\\r\\nthem at the slime-washed stairs,--again heard the gruff Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGive way, you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n like and order to dogs,--again saw the wicked Noah's Ark lying out on\\r\\nthe black water.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether\\r\\nundefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked on to\\r\\nthe hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension of\\r\\na painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I am confident\\r\\nthat it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the revival for a\\r\\nfew minutes of the terror of childhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had not only ordered\\r\\nmy dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter knew me. As\\r\\nsoon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory, he asked me\\r\\nif he should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccertainly not.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe waiter (it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from the\\r\\nCommercials, on the day when I was bound) appeared surprised, and\\r\\ntook the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local\\r\\nnewspaper so directly in my way, that I took it up and read this\\r\\nparagraph:--\\r\\n\\r\\nOur readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in reference to\\r\\nthe recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this\\r\\nneighborhood (what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of our as yet\\r\\nnot universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY, the poet of our columns!)\\r\\nthat the youth's earliest patron, companion, and friend, was a highly\\r\\nrespected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed\\r\\ntrade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises\\r\\nare situate within a hundred miles of the High Street. It is not wholly\\r\\nirrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as the Mentor\\r\\nof our young Telemachus, for it is good to know that our town produced\\r\\nthe founder of the latter's fortunes. Does the thought-contracted brow\\r\\nof the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose\\r\\nfortunes? We believe that Quintin Matsys was the BLACKSMITH of Antwerp.\\r\\nVERB. SAP.\\r\\n\\r\\nI entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in the\\r\\ndays of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have met\\r\\nsomebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilized man, who would have\\r\\ntold me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my\\r\\nfortunes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXIX\\r\\n\\r\\nBetimes in the morning I was up and out. It was too early yet to go to\\r\\nMiss Havisham's, so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham's\\r\\nside of town,--which was not Joe's side; I could go there\\r\\nto-morrow,--thinking about my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures\\r\\nof her plans for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had adopted Estella, she had as good as adopted me, and it could not\\r\\nfail to be her intention to bring us together. She reserved it for me to\\r\\nrestore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark rooms,\\r\\nset the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear down the\\r\\ncobwebs, destroy the vermin,--in short, do all the shining deeds of the\\r\\nyoung Knight of romance, and marry the Princess. I had stopped to\\r\\nlook at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked\\r\\nwindows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with\\r\\nits twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich\\r\\nattractive mystery, of which I was the hero. Estella was the inspiration\\r\\nof it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though she had taken such\\r\\nstrong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so set upon\\r\\nher, though her influence on my boyish life and character had been\\r\\nall-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her with any\\r\\nattributes save those she possessed. I mention this in this place, of a\\r\\nfixed purpose, because it is the clew by which I am to be followed into\\r\\nmy poor labyrinth. According to my experience, the conventional notion\\r\\nof a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified truth is, that when I\\r\\nloved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her simply because I found\\r\\nher irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often,\\r\\nif not always, that I loved her against reason, against promise, against\\r\\npeace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that\\r\\ncould be. Once for all; I loved her none the less because I knew it,\\r\\nand it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly\\r\\nbelieved her to be human perfection.\\r\\n\\r\\nI so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time. When\\r\\nI had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon the\\r\\ngate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart\\r\\nmoderately quiet. I heard the side-door open, and steps come across the\\r\\ncourtyard; but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on its\\r\\nrusty hinges.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned. I started\\r\\nmuch more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sober\\r\\ngray dress. The last man I should have expected to see in that place of\\r\\nporter at Miss Havisham's door.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOrlick!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, young master, there's more changes than yours. But come in, come\\r\\nin. It's opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI entered and he swung it, and locked it, and took the key out. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said he, facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards\\r\\nthe house. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHere I am!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow did you come here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI come her,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he retorted, Ã¢\\x80\\x9con my legs. I had my box brought alongside\\r\\nme in a barrow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you here for good?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI ain't here for harm, young master, I suppose?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was not so sure of that. I had leisure to entertain the retort in my\\r\\nmind, while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement, up my\\r\\nlegs and arms, to my face.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen you have left the forge?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo this look like a forge?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied Orlick, sending his glance all\\r\\nround him with an air of injury. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow, do it look like it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked him how long he had left Gargery's forge?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOne day is so like another here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat I don't know\\r\\nwithout casting it up. However, I come here some time since you left.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI could have told you that, Orlick.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, dryly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut then you've got to be a scholar.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time we had come to the house, where I found his room to be one\\r\\njust within the side-door, with a little window in it looking on the\\r\\ncourtyard. In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of place\\r\\nusually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris. Certain keys were hanging on\\r\\nthe wall, to which he now added the gate key; and his patchwork-covered\\r\\nbed was in a little inner division or recess. The whole had a slovenly,\\r\\nconfined, and sleepy look, like a cage for a human dormouse; while he,\\r\\nlooming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window, looked\\r\\nlike the human dormouse for whom it was fitted up,--as indeed he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI never saw this room before,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I remarked; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut there used to be no\\r\\nPorter here.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnot till it got about that there was no protection on\\r\\nthe premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts and\\r\\nTag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down. And then I was recommended to\\r\\nthe place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought, and\\r\\nI took it. It's easier than bellowsing and hammering.--That's loaded,\\r\\nthat is.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over the\\r\\nchimney-piece, and his eye had followed mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, not desirous of more conversation, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cshall I go up to\\r\\nMiss Havisham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBurn me, if I know!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he retorted, first stretching himself and then\\r\\nshaking himself; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmy orders ends here, young master. I give this here\\r\\nbell a rap with this here hammer, and you go on along the passage till\\r\\nyou meet somebody.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am expected, I believe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBurn me twice over, if I can say!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in\\r\\nmy thick boots, and he made his bell sound. At the end of the passage,\\r\\nwhile the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, who\\r\\nappeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason\\r\\nof me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou, is it, Mr. Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt is, Miss Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and family\\r\\nare all well.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre they any wiser?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthey\\r\\nhad better be wiser, than well. Ah, Matthew, Matthew! You know your way,\\r\\nsir?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time. I\\r\\nascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old\\r\\nway at the door of Miss Havisham's room. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPip's rap,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I heard her say,\\r\\nimmediately; Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccome in, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was in her chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her two\\r\\nhands crossed on her stick, her chin resting on them, and her eyes on\\r\\nthe fire. Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never been\\r\\nworn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an elegant\\r\\nlady whom I had never seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCome in, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking round\\r\\nor up; Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccome in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss my hand as if I\\r\\nwere a queen, eh?--Well?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in a\\r\\ngrimly playful manner,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI heard, Miss Havisham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, rather at a loss, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat you were so\\r\\nkind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and looked\\r\\narchly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella's eyes. But she\\r\\nwas so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly,\\r\\nin all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance,\\r\\nthat I seemed to have made none. I fancied, as I looked at her, that\\r\\nI slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again. O\\r\\nthe sense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and the\\r\\ninaccessibility that came about her!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gave me her hand. I stammered something about the pleasure I felt in\\r\\nseeing her again, and about my having looked forward to it, for a long,\\r\\nlong time.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you find her much changed, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Miss Havisham, with her\\r\\ngreedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between\\r\\nthem, as a sign to me to sit down there.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella\\r\\nin the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into the\\r\\nold--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat? You are not going to say into the old Estella?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Miss Havisham\\r\\ninterrupted. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away\\r\\nfrom her. Don't you remember?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better\\r\\nthen, and the like. Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she\\r\\nhad no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having been very\\r\\ndisagreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs he changed?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Miss Havisham asked her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery much,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, looking at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLess coarse and common?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella's\\r\\nhair.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her hand, and laughed again,\\r\\nand looked at me, and put the shoe down. She treated me as a boy still,\\r\\nbut she lured me on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had\\r\\nso wrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home from\\r\\nFrance, and that she was going to London. Proud and wilful as of old,\\r\\nshe had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that\\r\\nit was impossible and out of nature--or I thought so--to separate them\\r\\nfrom her beauty. Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence\\r\\nfrom all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had\\r\\ndisturbed my boyhood,--from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had\\r\\nfirst made me ashamed of home and Joe,--from all those visions that had\\r\\nraised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the\\r\\nanvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden\\r\\nwindow of the forge, and flit away. In a word, it was impossible for me\\r\\nto separate her, in the past or in the present, from the innermost life\\r\\nof my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and\\r\\nreturn to the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow. When we had\\r\\nconversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the\\r\\nneglected garden: on our coming in by and by, she said, I should wheel\\r\\nher about a little, as in times of yore.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I\\r\\nhad strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert;\\r\\nI, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she,\\r\\nquite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. As we\\r\\ndrew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight\\r\\nthat day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou rewarded me very much.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid I?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI remember I\\r\\nentertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill\\r\\nthat he should be brought here to pester me with his company.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe and I are great friends now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish\\r\\nlook, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSince your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your\\r\\ncompanions,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNaturally,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd necessarily,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, in a haughty tone; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat was fit company\\r\\nfor you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering\\r\\nintention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put\\r\\nit to flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nEstella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fighting\\r\\ntimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot the least.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my\\r\\nside, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at\\r\\nhers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me\\r\\nmore than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being\\r\\nso set apart for her and assigned to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and\\r\\nafter we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again\\r\\ninto the brewery yard. I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her\\r\\nwalking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and\\r\\ncareless look in that direction, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDid I?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I reminded her where she had\\r\\ncome out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\ndon't remember.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot remember that you made me cry?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nshe, and shook her head and looked about her. I verily believe that\\r\\nher not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry again,\\r\\ninwardly,--and that is the sharpest crying of all.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou must know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and\\r\\nbeautiful woman might, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat I have no heart,--if that has anything to\\r\\ndo with my memory.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of\\r\\ndoubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty\\r\\nwithout it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nEstella, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand of course if it ceased to beat I should cease\\r\\nto be. But you know what I mean. I have no softness there,\\r\\nno--sympathy--sentiment--nonsense.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and\\r\\nlooked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham? No.\\r\\nIn some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance\\r\\nto Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by\\r\\nchildren, from grown person with whom they have been much associated and\\r\\nsecluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will produce a remarkable\\r\\noccasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite\\r\\ndifferent. And yet I could not trace this to Miss Havisham. I looked\\r\\nagain, and though she was still looking at me, the suggestion was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was it?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am serious,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her brow was\\r\\nsmooth) as with a darkening of her face; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif we are to be thrown much\\r\\ntogether, you had better believe it at once. No!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d imperiously stopping\\r\\nme as I opened my lips. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere. I\\r\\nhave never had any such thing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and she\\r\\npointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same\\r\\nfirst day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and to have\\r\\nseen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed her white hand, again\\r\\nthe same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed me. My\\r\\ninvoluntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm. Instantly\\r\\nthe ghost passed once more and was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was it?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Estella. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAre you scared again?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should be, if I believed what you said just now,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I replied, to turn\\r\\nit off.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen you don't? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham will\\r\\nsoon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be\\r\\nlaid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round\\r\\nof the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my\\r\\ncruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She held it in one hand\\r\\nnow, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. We\\r\\nwalked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in\\r\\nbloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of\\r\\nthe old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it could\\r\\nnot have been more cherished in my remembrance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me;\\r\\nwe were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more\\r\\nin her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her\\r\\nbeauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of my delight,\\r\\nand at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness had chosen\\r\\nus for one another. Wretched boy!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise,\\r\\nthat my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and\\r\\nwould come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in\\r\\nthe room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we\\r\\nwere out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began\\r\\nthe old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But,\\r\\nin the funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the\\r\\nchair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and beautiful\\r\\nthan before, and I was under stronger enchantment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand,\\r\\nand Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centre\\r\\nof the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms\\r\\nstretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow\\r\\ncloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the\\r\\ndoor, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity\\r\\nthat was of its kind quite dreadful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and\\r\\nsaid in a whisper,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs she beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEverybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as\\r\\nshe sat in the chair. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLove her, love her, love her! How does she use\\r\\nyou?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a question\\r\\nat all) she repeated, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLove her, love her, love her! If she favors\\r\\nyou, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to\\r\\npieces,--and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,--love\\r\\nher, love her, love her!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNever had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her\\r\\nutterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm round\\r\\nmy neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHear me, Pip! I adopted her, to be loved. I bred her and educated her,\\r\\nto be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.\\r\\nLove her!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she\\r\\nmeant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of\\r\\nlove--despair--revenge--dire death--it could not have sounded from her\\r\\nlips more like a curse.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI'll tell you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat\\r\\nreal love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation,\\r\\nutter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the\\r\\nwhole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter--as I\\r\\ndid!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught\\r\\nher round the waist. For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of a\\r\\ndress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck herself\\r\\nagainst the wall and fallen dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her down into her chair, I\\r\\nwas conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in\\r\\nthe room.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a\\r\\npocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was\\r\\nof great value to him in his profession. I have seen him so terrify a\\r\\nclient or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief\\r\\nas if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing,\\r\\nas if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client\\r\\nor witness committed himself, that the self-committal has followed\\r\\ndirectly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him in the room he had\\r\\nthis expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking at\\r\\nus. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent pause\\r\\nin that attitude, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIndeed? Singular!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and then put the handkerchief to\\r\\nits right use with wonderful effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody\\r\\nelse) afraid of him. She made a strong attempt to compose herself, and\\r\\nstammered that he was as punctual as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs punctual as ever,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated, coming up to us. Ã¢\\x80\\x9c(How do you do,\\r\\nPip? Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?) And so you are\\r\\nhere, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to\\r\\ncome and see Estella. To which he replied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAh! Very fine young lady!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Then he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his\\r\\nlarge hands, and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocket\\r\\nwere full of secrets.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, when\\r\\nhe came to a stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow often?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh! How many times? Ten thousand times?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh! Certainly not so many.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTwice?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cJaggers,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cleave my Pip\\r\\nalone, and go with him to your dinner.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. While\\r\\nwe were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved\\r\\nyard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat\\r\\nand drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred\\r\\ntimes and once.\\r\\n\\r\\nI considered, and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNever.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd never will, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he retorted, with a frowning smile. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe has\\r\\nnever allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived this\\r\\npresent life of hers. She wanders about in the night, and then lays\\r\\nhands on such food as she takes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPray, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmay I ask you a question?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou may,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I may decline to answer it. Put your question.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEstella's name. Is it Havisham or--?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I had nothing to add.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOr what?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs it Havisham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt is Havisham.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket awaited\\r\\nus. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my\\r\\ngreen and yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by a\\r\\nmaid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but\\r\\nwho, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole\\r\\ntime. After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my\\r\\nguardian (he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and the\\r\\ntwo ladies left us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that\\r\\nroof I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks to\\r\\nhimself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella's face once during\\r\\ndinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,\\r\\nbut never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she often\\r\\nlooked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his\\r\\nface never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took\\r\\na dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often\\r\\nreferring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here,\\r\\nagain, he showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he\\r\\nextorted--and even did extort, though I don't know how--those references\\r\\nout of my innocent self.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon him\\r\\nof general lying by in consequence of information he possessed, that\\r\\nreally was too much for me. He cross-examined his very wine when he had\\r\\nnothing else in hand. He held it between himself and the candle, tasted\\r\\nthe port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his\\r\\nglass again, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and\\r\\ncross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had known\\r\\nthe wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage. Three or four\\r\\ntimes I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he saw\\r\\nme going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his\\r\\nhand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to\\r\\ntake notice that it was of no use, for he couldn't answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her\\r\\nin the danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her\\r\\ncap,--which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,--and\\r\\nstrewing the ground with her hair,--which assuredly had never grown\\r\\non her head. She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss\\r\\nHavisham's room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss\\r\\nHavisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels\\r\\nfrom her dressing-table into Estella's hair, and about her bosom and\\r\\narms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick\\r\\neyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him,\\r\\nwith those rich flushes of glitter and color in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, and\\r\\ncame out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the\\r\\nglory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor, of\\r\\nthe feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally in the\\r\\nlight of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long\\r\\nago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his cold\\r\\npresence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew I could\\r\\nnever bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could never bear to\\r\\nhear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bear to see\\r\\nhim wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be within\\r\\na foot or two of him,--it was, that my feelings should be in the same\\r\\nplace with him,--that, was the agonizing circumstance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe played until nine o'clock, and then it was arranged that when Estella\\r\\ncame to London I should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her\\r\\nat the coach; and then I took leave of her, and touched her and left\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine. Far into the\\r\\nnight, Miss Havisham's words, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLove her, love her, love her!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d sounded in\\r\\nmy ears. I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to my pillow, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nlove her, I love her, I love her!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d hundreds of times. Then, a burst of\\r\\ngratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me, once the\\r\\nblacksmith's boy. Then I thought if she were, as I feared, by no means\\r\\nrapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would she begin to be\\r\\ninterested in me? When should I awaken the heart within her that was\\r\\nmute and sleeping now?\\r\\n\\r\\nAh me! I thought those were high and great emotions. But I never thought\\r\\nthere was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe, because\\r\\nI knew she would be contemptuous of him. It was but a day gone, and Joe\\r\\nhad brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, God forgive me!\\r\\nsoon dried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXX\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar\\r\\nin the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick's\\r\\nbeing the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham's.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy of course he is not the right sort of man, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my guardian,\\r\\ncomfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbecause the man\\r\\nwho fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d It seemed\\r\\nquite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was\\r\\nnot exceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he listened in a\\r\\nsatisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cVery\\r\\ngood, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he observed, when I had concluded, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'll go round presently,\\r\\nand pay our friend off.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rather alarmed by this summary action, I was\\r\\nfor a little delay, and even hinted that our friend himself might be\\r\\ndifficult to deal with. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh no he won't,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my guardian, making his\\r\\npocket-handkerchief-point, with perfect confidence; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should like to\\r\\nsee him argue the question with me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we were going back together to London by the midday coach, and as I\\r\\nbreakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely hold\\r\\nmy cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a walk, and\\r\\nthat I would go on along the London road while Mr. Jaggers was occupied,\\r\\nif he would let the coachman know that I would get into my place when\\r\\novertaken. I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar immediately\\r\\nafter breakfast. By then making a loop of about a couple of miles into\\r\\nthe open country at the back of Pumblechook's premises, I got round into\\r\\nthe High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and felt myself in\\r\\ncomparative security.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was not\\r\\ndisagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after.\\r\\nOne or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went\\r\\na little way down the street before me, that they might turn, as if they\\r\\nhad forgotten something, and pass me face to face,--on which occasions I\\r\\ndon't know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they of not doing\\r\\nit, or I of not seeing it. Still my position was a distinguished one,\\r\\nand I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until Fate threw me in the\\r\\nway of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb's boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nCasting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, I\\r\\nbeheld Trabb's boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag.\\r\\nDeeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best\\r\\nbeseem me, and would be most likely to quell his evil mind, I advanced\\r\\nwith that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulating\\r\\nmyself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb's boy smote\\r\\ntogether, his hair uprose, his cap fell off, he trembled violently in\\r\\nevery limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHold me! I'm so frightened!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and\\r\\ncontrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance. As I passed him,\\r\\nhis teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark of extreme\\r\\nhumiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advanced\\r\\nanother two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement,\\r\\nand indignation, I again beheld Trabb's boy approaching. He was coming\\r\\nround a narrow corner. His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honest\\r\\nindustry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb's with\\r\\ncheerful briskness was indicated in his gait. With a shock he became\\r\\naware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time his\\r\\nmotion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with knees\\r\\nmore afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. His\\r\\nsufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators,\\r\\nand I felt utterly confounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when I\\r\\nagain beheld Trabb's boy shooting round by a back way. This time, he was\\r\\nentirely changed. He wore the blue bag in the manner of my great-coat,\\r\\nand was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of\\r\\nthe street, attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he\\r\\nfrom time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his hand, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDon't know yah!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon\\r\\nme by Trabb's boy, when passing abreast of me, he pulled up his\\r\\nshirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an arm akimbo, and smirked\\r\\nextravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body, and drawling to his\\r\\nattendants, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDon't know yah, don't know yah, 'pon my soul don't know\\r\\nyah!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking\\r\\nto crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows, as from an\\r\\nexceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith,\\r\\nculminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and was, so to\\r\\nspeak, ejected by it into the open country.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut unless I had taken the life of Trabb's boy on that occasion, I\\r\\nreally do not even now see what I could have done save endure. To\\r\\nhave struggled with him in the street, or to have exacted any lower\\r\\nrecompense from him than his heart's best blood, would have been\\r\\nfutile and degrading. Moreover, he was a boy whom no man could hurt; an\\r\\ninvulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flew\\r\\nout again between his captor's legs, scornfully yelping. I wrote,\\r\\nhowever, to Mr. Trabb by next day's post, to say that Mr. Pip must\\r\\ndecline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to\\r\\nthe best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excited Loathing\\r\\nin every respectable mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took my\\r\\nbox-seat again, and arrived in London safe,--but not sound, for my heart\\r\\nwas gone. As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrel\\r\\nof oysters to Joe (as reparation for not having gone myself), and then\\r\\nwent on to Barnard's Inn.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.\\r\\nHaving despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to the\\r\\ndinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my friend\\r\\nand chum. As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger in the\\r\\nhall, which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to\\r\\nthe keyhole, I sent him to the Play. A better proof of the severity\\r\\nof my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded, than\\r\\nthe degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to find him\\r\\nemployment. So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him to Hyde Park\\r\\ncorner to see what o'clock it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nDinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to\\r\\nHerbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell\\r\\nyou.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear Handel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI shall esteem and respect your\\r\\nconfidence.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt concerns myself, Herbert,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand one other person.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert crossed his feet, looked at the fire with his head on one side,\\r\\nand having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because I\\r\\ndidn't go on.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHerbert,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, laying my hand upon his knee, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI love--I\\r\\nadore--Estella.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easy matter-of-course\\r\\nway, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cExactly. Well?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Herbert? Is that all you say? Well?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat next, I mean?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course I know that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow do you know it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow do I know it, Handel? Why, from you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI never told you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTold me! You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but I\\r\\nhave had senses to perceive it. You have always adored her, ever since\\r\\nI have known you. You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here\\r\\ntogether. Told me! Why, you have always told me all day long. When you\\r\\ntold me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring her\\r\\nthe first time you saw her, when you were very young indeed.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery well, then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome\\r\\nlight, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have never left off adoring her. And she has come back, a most\\r\\nbeautiful and most elegant creature. And I saw her yesterday. And if I\\r\\nadored her before, I now doubly adore her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLucky for you then, Handel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat you are picked out for\\r\\nher and allotted to her. Without encroaching on forbidden ground, we\\r\\nmay venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of\\r\\nthat fact. Have you any idea yet, of Estella's views on the adoration\\r\\nquestion?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI shook my head gloomily. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh! She is thousands of miles away, from me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPatience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough. But you have\\r\\nsomething more to say?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am ashamed to say it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I returned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand yet it's no worse to say it\\r\\nthan to think it. You call me a lucky fellow. Of course, I am. I was a\\r\\nblacksmith's boy but yesterday; I am--what shall I say I am--to-day?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSay a good fellow, if you want a phrase,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Herbert, smiling,\\r\\nand clapping his hand on the back of mine--Ã¢\\x80\\x9ca good fellow, with\\r\\nimpetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and\\r\\ndreaming, curiously mixed in him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture\\r\\nin my character. On the whole, I by no means recognized the analysis,\\r\\nbut thought it not worth disputing.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Herbert,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I went on, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nsuggest what I have in my thoughts. You say I am lucky. I know I have\\r\\ndone nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raised\\r\\nme; that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of Estella--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n(Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd when don't you, you know?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Herbert threw in, with his eyes on the\\r\\nfire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him.)\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c--Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain\\r\\nI feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances. Avoiding forbidden\\r\\nground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy of\\r\\none person (naming no person) all my expectations depend. And at the\\r\\nbest, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what\\r\\nthey are!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d In saying this, I relieved my mind of what had always been\\r\\nthere, more or less, though no doubt most since yesterday.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Handel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Herbert replied, in his gay, hopeful way, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit seems to me\\r\\nthat in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into our\\r\\ngift-horse's mouth with a magnifying-glass. Likewise, it seems to me\\r\\nthat, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogether\\r\\noverlook one of the best points of the animal. Didn't you tell me that\\r\\nyour guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were\\r\\nnot endowed with expectations only? And even if he had not told you\\r\\nso,--though that is a very large If, I grant,--could you believe that of\\r\\nall men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relations\\r\\ntowards you unless he were sure of his ground?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI said I could not deny that this was a strong point. I said it (people\\r\\noften do so, in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truth\\r\\nand justice;--as if I wanted to deny it!\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should think it was a strong point,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I should\\r\\nthink you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you\\r\\nmust bide your guardian's time, and he must bide his client's time.\\r\\nYou'll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and then perhaps\\r\\nyou'll get some further enlightenment. At all events, you'll be nearer\\r\\ngetting it, for it must come at last.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat a hopeful disposition you have!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, gratefully admiring his\\r\\ncheery ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI ought to have,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor I have not much else. I must\\r\\nacknowledge, by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said is\\r\\nnot my own, but my father's. The only remark I ever heard him make on\\r\\nyour story, was the final one, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe thing is settled and done, or Mr.\\r\\nJaggers would not be in it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And now before I say anything more about my\\r\\nfather, or my father's son, and repay confidence with confidence, I want\\r\\nto make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a moment,--positively\\r\\nrepulsive.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou won't succeed,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO yes I shall!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOne, two, three, and now I am in for it.\\r\\nHandel, my good fellow;Ã¢\\x80\\x9d--though he spoke in this light tone, he was\\r\\nvery much in earnest,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have been thinking since we have been talking\\r\\nwith our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a condition\\r\\nof your inheritance, if she was never referred to by your guardian. Am\\r\\nI right in so understanding what you have told me, as that he never\\r\\nreferred to her, directly or indirectly, in any way? Never even hinted,\\r\\nfor instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage\\r\\nultimately?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNever.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Handel, I am quite free from the flavor of sour grapes, upon my\\r\\nsoul and honor! Not being bound to her, can you not detach yourself from\\r\\nher?--I told you I should be disagreeable.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old marsh\\r\\nwinds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had subdued\\r\\nme on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were solemnly\\r\\nrising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post, smote upon\\r\\nmy heart again. There was silence between us for a little while.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes; but my dear Handel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Herbert went on, as if we had been talking,\\r\\ninstead of silent, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cits having been so strongly rooted in the breast of\\r\\na boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very\\r\\nserious. Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham. Think of\\r\\nwhat she is herself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me). This may\\r\\nlead to miserable things.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI know it, Herbert,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, with my head still turned away, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I\\r\\ncan't help it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou can't detach yourself?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. Impossible!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou can't try, Handel?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. Impossible!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had\\r\\nbeen asleep, and stirring the fire, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnow I'll endeavor to make myself\\r\\nagreeable again!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs\\r\\nin their places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about,\\r\\nlooked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and\\r\\ncame back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down, nursing his left\\r\\nleg in both arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI was going to say a word or two, Handel, concerning my father and my\\r\\nfather's son. I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father's son\\r\\nto remark that my father's establishment is not particularly brilliant\\r\\nin its housekeeping.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere is always plenty, Herbert,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, to say something encouraging.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO yes! and so the dustman says, I believe, with the strongest approval,\\r\\nand so does the marine-store shop in the back street. Gravely, Handel,\\r\\nfor the subject is grave enough, you know how it is as well as I do. I\\r\\nsuppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up;\\r\\nbut if ever there was, the time is gone. May I ask you if you have ever\\r\\nhad an opportunity of remarking, down in your part of the country,\\r\\nthat the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most\\r\\nparticularly anxious to be married?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIs it\\r\\nso?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat's what I want to know. Because it\\r\\nis decidedly the case with us. My poor sister Charlotte, who was next me\\r\\nand died before she was fourteen, was a striking example. Little Jane\\r\\nis the same. In her desire to be matrimonially established, you\\r\\nmight suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual\\r\\ncontemplation of domestic bliss. Little Alick in a frock has already\\r\\nmade arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew. And\\r\\nindeed, I think we are all engaged, except the baby.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen you are?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut it's a secret.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI assured him of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favored with\\r\\nfurther particulars. He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my\\r\\nweakness that I wanted to know something about his strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMay I ask the name?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cName of Clara,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLive in London?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, perhaps I ought to mention,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, who had become\\r\\ncuriously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting\\r\\ntheme, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat she is rather below my mother's nonsensical family notions.\\r\\nHer father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships. I think he\\r\\nwas a species of purser.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is he now?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe's an invalid now,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied Herbert.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLiving on--?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOn the first floor,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert. Which was not at all what I meant,\\r\\nfor I had intended my question to apply to his means. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have never seen\\r\\nhim, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I have known Clara.\\r\\nBut I have heard him constantly. He makes tremendous rows,--roars, and\\r\\npegs at the floor with some frightful instrument.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d In looking at me and\\r\\nthen laughing heartily, Herbert for the time recovered his usual lively\\r\\nmanner.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDon't you expect to see him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO yes, I constantly expect to see him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbecause\\r\\nI never hear him, without expecting him to come tumbling through the\\r\\nceiling. But I don't know how long the rafters may hold.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had once more laughed heartily, he became meek again, and told\\r\\nme that the moment he began to realize Capital, it was his intention\\r\\nto marry this young lady. He added as a self-evident proposition,\\r\\nengendering low spirits, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut you can't marry, you know, while you're\\r\\nlooking about you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision to\\r\\nrealize this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in my pockets.\\r\\nA folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention, I opened\\r\\nit and found it to be the play-bill I had received from Joe, relative\\r\\nto the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian renown. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd bless my\\r\\nheart,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I involuntarily added aloud, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit's to-night!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis changed the subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly resolve\\r\\nto go to the play. So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet\\r\\nHerbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable\\r\\nmeans, and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me\\r\\nby reputation and that I should be presented to her, and when we had\\r\\nwarmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out our candles,\\r\\nmade up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in quest of Mr.\\r\\nWopsle and Denmark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXXI\\r\\n\\r\\nOn our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country\\r\\nelevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The\\r\\nwhole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble\\r\\nboy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer\\r\\nwith a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life,\\r\\nand the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white\\r\\nsilk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My gifted\\r\\ntownsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could have wished\\r\\nthat his curls and forehead had been more probable.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded.\\r\\nThe late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled\\r\\nwith a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it with him\\r\\nto the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom also carried\\r\\na ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had the appearance\\r\\nof occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of anxiety and a\\r\\ntendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state\\r\\nof mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led to the Shade's being\\r\\nadvised by the gallery to Ã¢\\x80\\x9cturn over!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d--a recommendation which it took\\r\\nextremely ill. It was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit, that\\r\\nwhereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time\\r\\nand walked an immense distance, it perceptibly came from a closely\\r\\ncontiguous wall. This occasioned its terrors to be received derisively.\\r\\nThe Queen of Denmark, a very buxom lady, though no doubt historically\\r\\nbrazen, was considered by the public to have too much brass about her;\\r\\nher chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal (as\\r\\nif she had a gorgeous toothache), her waist being encircled by another,\\r\\nand each of her arms by another, so that she was openly mentioned\\r\\nas Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe kettle-drum.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The noble boy in the ancestral boots was\\r\\ninconsistent, representing himself, as it were in one breath, as an able\\r\\nseaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a clergyman, and a person\\r\\nof the utmost importance at a Court fencing-match, on the authority\\r\\nof whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were\\r\\njudged. This gradually led to a want of toleration for him, and even--on\\r\\nhis being detected in holy orders, and declining to perform the funeral\\r\\nservice--to the general indignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly,\\r\\nOphelia was a prey to such slow musical madness, that when, in course of\\r\\ntime, she had taken off her white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried\\r\\nit, a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an\\r\\niron bar in the front row of the gallery, growled, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow the baby's put\\r\\nto bed let's have supper!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Which, to say the least of it, was out of\\r\\nkeeping.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with\\r\\nplayful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or\\r\\nstate a doubt, the public helped him out with it. As for example; on the\\r\\nquestion whether 'twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared yes,\\r\\nand some no, and some inclining to both opinions said Ã¢\\x80\\x9cToss up for\\r\\nit;Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and quite a Debating Society arose. When he asked what should such\\r\\nfellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouraged\\r\\nwith loud cries of Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHear, hear!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d When he appeared with his stocking\\r\\ndisordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very neat\\r\\nfold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat iron),\\r\\na conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his\\r\\nleg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him.\\r\\nOn his taking the recorders,--very like a little black flute that had\\r\\njust been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door,--he was\\r\\ncalled upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When he recommended the\\r\\nplayer not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd don't you do\\r\\nit, neither; you're a deal worse than him!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And I grieve to add that\\r\\npeals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of these occasions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut his greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the appearance\\r\\nof a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash-house\\r\\non one side, and a turnpike gate on the other. Mr. Wopsle in a\\r\\ncomprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike,\\r\\nthe gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLook out! Here's the\\r\\nundertaker a coming, to see how you're a getting on with your work!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n I believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle\\r\\ncould not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it,\\r\\nwithout dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast;\\r\\nbut even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the\\r\\ncomment, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWai-ter!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The arrival of the body for interment (in an empty\\r\\nblack box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a general\\r\\njoy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the bearers, of\\r\\nan individual obnoxious to identification. The joy attended Mr. Wopsle\\r\\nthrough his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the orchestra and\\r\\nthe grave, and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the\\r\\nkitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles upward.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle;\\r\\nbut they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we had sat,\\r\\nfeeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. I\\r\\nlaughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll;\\r\\nand yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly\\r\\nfine in Mr. Wopsle's elocution,--not for old associations' sake, I am\\r\\nafraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and\\r\\ndownhill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural\\r\\ncircumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.\\r\\nWhen the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and hooted, I said\\r\\nto Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe made all the haste we could downstairs, but we were not quick enough\\r\\neither. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy\\r\\nsmear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we\\r\\ncame up with him,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Pip and friend?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIdentity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Waldengarver,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the man, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwould be glad to have the honor.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWaldengarver?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I repeated--when Herbert murmured in my ear, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cProbably\\r\\nWopsle.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes. Shall we follow you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA few steps, please.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d When we were in a side alley, he turned and\\r\\nasked, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow did you think he looked?--I dressed him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't know what he had looked like, except a funeral; with the\\r\\naddition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a\\r\\nblue ribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in some\\r\\nextraordinary Fire Office. But I said he had looked very nice.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen he come to the grave,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said our conductor, Ã¢\\x80\\x9che showed his cloak\\r\\nbeautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when he\\r\\nsee the ghost in the queen's apartment, he might have made more of his\\r\\nstockings.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door,\\r\\ninto a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it. Here Mr. Wopsle\\r\\nwas divesting himself of his Danish garments, and here there was just\\r\\nroom for us to look at him over one another's shoulders, by keeping the\\r\\npacking-case door, or lid, wide open.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGentlemen,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wopsle, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am proud to see you. I hope, Mr. Pip,\\r\\nyou will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to know you in\\r\\nformer times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been\\r\\nacknowledged, on the noble and the affluent.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to\\r\\nget himself out of his princely sables.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSkin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the owner of that\\r\\nproperty, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cor you'll bust 'em. Bust 'em, and you'll bust five-and-thirty\\r\\nshillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair. Keep\\r\\nquiet in your chair now, and leave 'em to me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that, he went upon his knees, and began to flay his victim; who, on\\r\\nthe first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over backward\\r\\nwith his chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then, Mr.\\r\\nWaldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert said from behind (at the same time poking me), Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCapitally.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d So I\\r\\nsaid Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCapitally.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr.\\r\\nWaldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert said from behind (again poking me), Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMassive and concrete.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d So I\\r\\nsaid boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon it,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMassive and concrete.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Waldengarver,\\r\\nwith an air of dignity, in spite of his being ground against the wall at\\r\\nthe time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut I'll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the man who was on\\r\\nhis knees, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cin which you're out in your reading. Now mind! I don't care\\r\\nwho says contrairy; I tell you so. You're out in your reading of Hamlet\\r\\nwhen you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I dressed, made\\r\\nthe same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to put a\\r\\nlarge red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal (which\\r\\nwas the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and whenever\\r\\nhis reading brought him into profile, I called out Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't see no\\r\\nwafers!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And at night his reading was lovely.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say Ã¢\\x80\\x9ca faithful\\r\\nDependent--I overlook his folly;Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and then said aloud, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMy view is a\\r\\nlittle classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve, they\\r\\nwill improve.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid you observe, gentlemen,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Waldengarver, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat there was a\\r\\nman in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the service,--I\\r\\nmean, the representation?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. I\\r\\nadded, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe was drunk, no doubt.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO dear no, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wopsle, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnot drunk. His employer would see to\\r\\nthat, sir. His employer would not allow him to be drunk.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know his employer?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again; performing both\\r\\nceremonies very slowly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou must have observed, gentlemen,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9can ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance\\r\\nexpressive of low malignity, who went through--I will not say\\r\\nsustained--the rÃÂ´le (if I may use a French expression) of Claudius, King\\r\\nof Denmark. That is his employer, gentlemen. Such is the profession!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for Mr.\\r\\nWopsle if he had been in despair, I was so sorry for him as it was,\\r\\nthat I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces\\r\\nput on,--which jostled us out at the doorway,--to ask Herbert what he\\r\\nthought of having him home to supper? Herbert said he thought it would\\r\\nbe kind to do so; therefore I invited him, and he went to Barnard's\\r\\nwith us, wrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him, and he sat\\r\\nuntil two o'clock in the morning, reviewing his success and developing\\r\\nhis plans. I forget in detail what they were, but I have a general\\r\\nrecollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end\\r\\nwith crushing it; inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft\\r\\nand without a chance or hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella, and\\r\\nmiserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and that I\\r\\nhad to give my hand in marriage to Herbert's Clara, or play Hamlet to\\r\\nMiss Havisham's Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowing\\r\\ntwenty words of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXXII\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day when I was busy with my books and Mr. Pocket, I received a note\\r\\nby the post, the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter;\\r\\nfor, though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed,\\r\\nI divined whose hand it was. It had no set beginning, as Dear Mr. Pip,\\r\\nor Dear Pip, or Dear Sir, or Dear Anything, but ran thus:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am to come to London the day after to-morrow by the midday coach. I\\r\\nbelieve it was settled you should meet me? At all events Miss Havisham\\r\\nhas that impression, and I write in obedience to it. She sends you her\\r\\nregard.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYours, ESTELLA.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there had been time, I should probably have ordered several suits\\r\\nof clothes for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to be\\r\\ncontent with those I had. My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew\\r\\nno peace or rest until the day arrived. Not that its arrival brought\\r\\nme either; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the\\r\\ncoach-office in Wood Street, Cheapside, before the coach had left the\\r\\nBlue Boar in our town. For all that I knew this perfectly well, I still\\r\\nfelt as if it were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sight\\r\\nlonger than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason I\\r\\nhad performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours, when\\r\\nWemmick ran against me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHalloa, Mr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he; Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow do you do? I should hardly have thought\\r\\nthis was your beat.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by\\r\\ncoach, and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBoth flourishing thankye,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand particularly the Aged.\\r\\nHe's in wonderful feather. He'll be eighty-two next birthday. I have\\r\\na notion of firing eighty-two times, if the neighborhood shouldn't\\r\\ncomplain, and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure.\\r\\nHowever, this is not London talk. Where do you think I am going to?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTo the office?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, for he was tending in that direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNext thing to it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am going to Newgate. We are in\\r\\na banker's-parcel case just at present, and I have been down the road\\r\\ntaking a squint at the scene of action, and thereupon must have a word\\r\\nor two with our client.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid your client commit the robbery?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBless your soul and body, no,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d answered Wemmick, very drily. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut he\\r\\nis accused of it. So might you or I be. Either of us might be accused of\\r\\nit, you know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOnly neither of us is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYah!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with his forefinger;\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cyou're a deep one, Mr. Pip! Would you like to have a look at Newgate?\\r\\nHave you time to spare?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had so much time to spare, that the proposal came as a relief,\\r\\nnotwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my\\r\\neye on the coach-office. Muttering that I would make the inquiry whether\\r\\nI had time to walk with him, I went into the office, and ascertained\\r\\nfrom the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his\\r\\ntemper, the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected,--which\\r\\nI knew beforehand, quite as well as he. I then rejoined Mr. Wemmick, and\\r\\naffecting to consult my watch, and to be surprised by the information I\\r\\nhad received, accepted his offer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge\\r\\nwhere some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison\\r\\nrules, into the interior of the jail. At that time jails were much\\r\\nneglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on\\r\\nall public wrongdoing--and which is always its heaviest and longest\\r\\npunishment--was still far off. So, felons were not lodged and fed better\\r\\nthan soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to their\\r\\nprisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup.\\r\\nIt was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was going his\\r\\nrounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards, were buying\\r\\nbeer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly, disorderly, depressing\\r\\nscene it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener\\r\\nmight walk among his plants. This was first put into my head by his\\r\\nseeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat, Captain\\r\\nTom? Are you there? Ah, indeed!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and also, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIs that Black Bill behind\\r\\nthe cistern? Why I didn't look for you these two months; how do you find\\r\\nyourself?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to\\r\\nanxious whisperers,--always singly,--Wemmick with his post-office in\\r\\nan immovable state, looked at them while in conference, as if he were\\r\\ntaking particular notice of the advance they had made, since last\\r\\nobserved, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar department\\r\\nof Mr. Jaggers's business; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers\\r\\nhung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. His\\r\\npersonal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod,\\r\\nand in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both\\r\\nhands, and then tightening the post-office, and putting his hands in his\\r\\npockets. In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the\\r\\nraising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible from\\r\\nthe insufficient money produced, said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit's no use, my boy. I'm only\\r\\na subordinate. I can't take it. Don't go on in that way with a\\r\\nsubordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had\\r\\nbetter address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals\\r\\nin the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one, may\\r\\nbe worth the while of another; that's my recommendation to you, speaking\\r\\nas a subordinate. Don't try on useless measures. Why should you? Now,\\r\\nwho's next?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, we walked through Wemmick's greenhouse, until he turned to me and\\r\\nsaid, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNotice the man I shall shake hands with.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I should have done so,\\r\\nwithout the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can\\r\\nsee now, as I write) in a well-worn olive-colored frock-coat, with a\\r\\npeculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and eyes that\\r\\nwent wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner\\r\\nof the bars, and put his hand to his hat--which had a greasy and fatty\\r\\nsurface like cold broth--with a half-serious and half-jocose military\\r\\nsalute.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cColonel, to you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick; Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow are you, Colonel?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAll right, Mr. Wemmick.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEverything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too strong\\r\\nfor us, Colonel.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, it was too strong, sir,--but I don't care.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, coolly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou don't care.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Then, turning to me,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cServed His Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and bought his\\r\\ndischarge.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIndeed?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and the man's eyes looked at me, and then looked over\\r\\nmy head, and then looked all round me, and then he drew his hand across\\r\\nhis lips and laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said to Wemmick.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned my friend, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut there's no knowing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mr. Wemmick,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nthe man, stretching out his hand between two bars.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThankye,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, shaking hands with him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSame to you, Colonel.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nman, unwilling to let his hand go, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should have asked the favor of\\r\\nyour wearing another ring--in acknowledgment of your attentions.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI'll accept the will for the deed,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBy the by; you were\\r\\nquite a pigeon-fancier.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The man looked up at the sky. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am told you\\r\\nhad a remarkable breed of tumblers. Could you commission any friend of\\r\\nyours to bring me a pair, if you've no further use for 'em?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt shall be done, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAll right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthey shall be taken care of. Good afternoon,\\r\\nColonel. Good-bye!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d They shook hands again, and as we walked away Wemmick\\r\\nsaid to me, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA Coiner, a very good workman. The Recorder's report is\\r\\nmade to-day, and he is sure to be executed on Monday. Still you see, as\\r\\nfar as it goes, a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n With that, he looked back, and nodded at this dead plant, and then cast\\r\\nhis eyes about him in walking out of the yard, as if he were considering\\r\\nwhat other pot would go best in its place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the great\\r\\nimportance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less\\r\\nthan by those whom they held in charge. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Mr. Wemmick,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nturnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates,\\r\\nand who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat's Mr.\\r\\nJaggers going to do with that water-side murder? Is he going to make it\\r\\nmanslaughter, or what's he going to make of it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy don't you ask him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Wemmick.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO yes, I dare say!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the turnkey.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, that's the way with them here, Mr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d remarked Wemmick, turning\\r\\nto me with his post-office elongated. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThey don't mind what they ask of\\r\\nme, the subordinate; but you'll never catch 'em asking any questions of\\r\\nmy principal.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs this young gentleman one of the 'prentices or articled ones of your\\r\\noffice?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmick's humor.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere he goes again, you see!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI told you so! Asks\\r\\nanother question of the subordinate before his first is dry! Well,\\r\\nsupposing Mr. Pip is one of them?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the turnkey, grinning again, Ã¢\\x80\\x9che knows what Mr. Jaggers\\r\\nis.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYah!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious\\r\\nway, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou're dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my\\r\\nprincipal, you know you are. Let us out, you old fox, or I'll get him to\\r\\nbring an action against you for false imprisonment.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at us over\\r\\nthe spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMind you, Mr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took my arm\\r\\nto be more confidential; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't know that Mr. Jaggers does a better\\r\\nthing than the way in which he keeps himself so high. He's always so\\r\\nhigh. His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities. That\\r\\nColonel durst no more take leave of him, than that turnkey durst ask him\\r\\nhis intentions respecting a case. Then, between his height and them, he\\r\\nslips in his subordinate,--don't you see?--and so he has 'em, soul and\\r\\nbody.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardian's\\r\\nsubtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for the\\r\\nfirst time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where\\r\\nsuppliants for Mr. Jaggers's notice were lingering about as usual, and I\\r\\nreturned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some three\\r\\nhours on hand. I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it\\r\\nwas that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime;\\r\\nthat, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening, I\\r\\nshould have first encountered it; that, it should have reappeared on two\\r\\noccasions, starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone; that,\\r\\nit should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement. While my\\r\\nmind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful young Estella, proud\\r\\nand refined, coming towards me, and I thought with absolute abhorrence\\r\\nof the contrast between the jail and her. I wished that Wemmick had not\\r\\nmet me, or that I had not yielded to him and gone with him, so that,\\r\\nof all days in the year on this day, I might not have had Newgate in\\r\\nmy breath and on my clothes. I beat the prison dust off my feet as I\\r\\nsauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress, and I exhaled\\r\\nits air from my lungs. So contaminated did I feel, remembering who was\\r\\ncoming, that the coach came quickly after all, and I was not yet free\\r\\nfrom the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick's conservatory, when I saw\\r\\nher face at the coach window and her hand waving to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXXIII\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately beautiful\\r\\nthan she had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. Her manner was more\\r\\nwinning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and I thought I\\r\\nsaw Miss Havisham's influence in the change.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, and\\r\\nwhen it was all collected I remembered--having forgotten everything but\\r\\nherself in the meanwhile--that I knew nothing of her destination.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am going to Richmond,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she told me. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOur lesson is, that there are\\r\\ntwo Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the\\r\\nSurrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage, and\\r\\nyou are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges out\\r\\nof it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I, but to\\r\\nobey our instructions. We are not free to follow our own devices, you\\r\\nand I.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an\\r\\ninner meaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not with\\r\\ndispleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here a\\r\\nlittle?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you\\r\\nare to take care of me the while.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a\\r\\nwaiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen\\r\\nsuch a thing in his life, to show us a private sitting-room. Upon that,\\r\\nhe pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clew without which he\\r\\ncouldn't find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the\\r\\nestablishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluous\\r\\narticle, considering the hole's proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet,\\r\\nand somebody's pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, he took us into\\r\\nanother room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a scorched\\r\\nleaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust. Having looked at this\\r\\nextinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order; which,\\r\\nproving to be merely, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSome tea for the lady,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d sent him out of the room\\r\\nin a very low state of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong\\r\\ncombination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that\\r\\nthe coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising\\r\\nproprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.\\r\\nYet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I thought that\\r\\nwith her I could have been happy there for life. (I was not at all happy\\r\\nthere at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhere are you going to, at Richmond?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked Estella.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am going to live,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cat a great expense, with a lady there,\\r\\nwho has the power--or says she has--of taking me about, and introducing\\r\\nme, and showing people to me and showing me to people.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I suppose so.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe answered so carelessly, that I said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou speak of yourself as if\\r\\nyou were some one else.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhere did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella,\\r\\nsmiling delightfully, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou must not expect me to go to school to you; I\\r\\nmust talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI live quite pleasantly there; at least--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d It appeared to me that I was\\r\\nlosing a chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt least?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated Estella.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou silly boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, quite composedly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow can you talk such\\r\\nnonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest of\\r\\nhis family?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery superior indeed. He is nobody's enemy--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDon't add but his own,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d interposed Estella, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor I hate that class of\\r\\nman. But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite,\\r\\nI have heard?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am sure I have every reason to say so.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nEstella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once\\r\\ngrave and rallying, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor they beset Miss Havisham with reports and\\r\\ninsinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you,\\r\\nwrite letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment\\r\\nand the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realize to yourself\\r\\nthe hatred those people feel for you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey do me no harm, I hope?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very singular\\r\\nto me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity. When she left\\r\\noff--and she had not laughed languidly, but with real enjoyment--I said,\\r\\nin my diffident way with her,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any\\r\\nharm.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no you may be sure of that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou may be certain that\\r\\nI laugh because they fail. O, those people with Miss Havisham, and the\\r\\ntortures they undergo!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She laughed again, and even now when she had\\r\\ntold me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could not\\r\\ndoubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion.\\r\\nI thought there must really be something more here than I knew; she saw\\r\\nthe thought in my mind, and answered it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt is not easy for even you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto know what satisfaction\\r\\nit gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of\\r\\nthe ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not\\r\\nbrought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. You had not\\r\\nyour little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed\\r\\nand defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that\\r\\nis soft and soothing. I had. You did not gradually open your round\\r\\nchildish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a\\r\\nwoman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up\\r\\nin the night. I did.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these\\r\\nremembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of\\r\\nthat look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTwo things I can tell you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFirst, notwithstanding the\\r\\nproverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set\\r\\nyour mind at rest that these people never will--never would, in hundred\\r\\nyears--impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great\\r\\nor small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so\\r\\nbusy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she gave it to me playfully,--for her darker mood had been but\\r\\nMomentary,--I held it and put it to my lips. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou ridiculous boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nEstella, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwill you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the\\r\\nsame spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat spirit was that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and\\r\\nplotters.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if you\\r\\nlike.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue's. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nEstella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou are to take\\r\\ncare that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon\\r\\nus, and we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our\\r\\nintercourse did give me pain. Whatever her tone with me happened to be,\\r\\nI could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on\\r\\nagainst trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So it\\r\\nalways was.\\r\\n\\r\\nI rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clew,\\r\\nbrought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of\\r\\ntea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and\\r\\nforks (including carvers), spoons (various), saltcellars, a meek little\\r\\nmuffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover,\\r\\nMoses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of\\r\\nparsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof impressions of\\r\\nthe bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread, and\\r\\nultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered in with,\\r\\nexpressing in his countenance burden and suffering. After a prolonged\\r\\nabsence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length came back with\\r\\na casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These I steeped in hot\\r\\nwater, and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of I\\r\\ndon't know what for Estella.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten,\\r\\nand the chambermaid taken into consideration,--in a word, the whole\\r\\nhouse bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella's purse\\r\\nmuch lightened,--we got into our post-coach and drove away. Turning into\\r\\nCheapside and rattling up Newgate Street, we were soon under the walls\\r\\nof which I was so ashamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat place is that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Estella asked me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it, and then\\r\\ntold her. As she looked at it, and drew in her head again,\\r\\nmurmuring, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWretches!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I would not have confessed to my visit for any\\r\\nconsideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Jaggers,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9chas the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place\\r\\nthan any man in London.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe is more in the secrets of every place, I think,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, in a\\r\\nlow voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since\\r\\nI can remember. But I know him no better now, than I did before I could\\r\\nspeak plainly. What is your own experience of him? Do you advance with\\r\\nhim?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOnce habituated to his distrustful manner,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have done very\\r\\nwell.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you intimate?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have dined with him at his private house.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI fancy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, shrinking Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat must be a curious place.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt is a curious place.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with\\r\\nher; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe\\r\\nthe dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden\\r\\nglare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive\\r\\nwith that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out of\\r\\nit, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in lightning.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by\\r\\nwhich we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this\\r\\nside of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to her, she\\r\\ntold me, for she had never left Miss Havisham's neighborhood until she\\r\\nhad gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then in\\r\\ngoing and returning. I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her\\r\\nwhile she remained here? To that she emphatically said Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGod forbid!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and\\r\\nno more.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me;\\r\\nthat she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task\\r\\nhad needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for even if she had\\r\\nnot taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should have\\r\\nfelt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do\\r\\nit, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush\\r\\nit and throw it away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. Matthew\\r\\nPocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I\\r\\nhoped I should see her sometimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you\\r\\nare to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo; there are only two; mother and daughter. The mother is a lady of\\r\\nsome station, though not averse to increasing her income.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt is a part of Miss Havisham's plans for me, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, with\\r\\na sigh, as if she were tired; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am to write to her constantly and see\\r\\nher regularly and report how I go on,--I and the jewels,--for they are\\r\\nnearly all mine now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the first time she had ever called me by my name. Of course she\\r\\ndid so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a house\\r\\nby the green,--a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches,\\r\\nembroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their\\r\\ncourt days many a time. Some ancient trees before the house were still\\r\\ncut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and\\r\\nstiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of\\r\\nthe dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go the\\r\\nsilent way of the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bell with an old voice--which I dare say in its time had often said\\r\\nto the house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted\\r\\nsword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire--sounded\\r\\ngravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-colored maids came fluttering\\r\\nout to receive Estella. The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she\\r\\ngave me her hand and a smile, and said good night, and was absorbed\\r\\nlikewise. And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I\\r\\nshould be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happy\\r\\nwith her, but always miserable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in\\r\\nwith a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache. At our\\r\\nown door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party\\r\\nescorted by her little lover; and I envied her little lover, in spite of\\r\\nhis being subject to Flopson.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pocket was out lecturing; for, he was a most delightful lecturer on\\r\\ndomestic economy, and his treatises on the management of children and\\r\\nservants were considered the very best text-books on those themes. But\\r\\nMrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of\\r\\nthe baby's having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep him quiet\\r\\nduring the unaccountable absence (with a relative in the Foot Guards)\\r\\nof Millers. And more needles were missing than it could be regarded\\r\\nas quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply\\r\\nexternally or to take as a tonic.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical\\r\\nadvice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a\\r\\nhighly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heart-ache of begging him\\r\\nto accept my confidence. But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as she\\r\\nsat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a sovereign\\r\\nremedy for baby, I thought--Well--No, I wouldn't.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXXIV\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to\\r\\nnotice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their influence on\\r\\nmy own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible,\\r\\nbut I knew very well that it was not all good. I lived in a state of\\r\\nchronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to Joe. My conscience was not\\r\\nby any means comfortable about Biddy. When I woke up in the night,--like\\r\\nCamilla,--I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits, that I should\\r\\nhave been happier and better if I had never seen Miss Havisham's face,\\r\\nand had risen to manhood content to be partners with Joe in the honest\\r\\nold forge. Many a time of an evening, when I sat alone looking at the\\r\\nfire, I thought, after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the\\r\\nkitchen fire at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of\\r\\nmind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part\\r\\nin its production. That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations,\\r\\nand yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my\\r\\nsatisfaction that I should have done much better. Now, concerning the\\r\\ninfluence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so\\r\\nI perceived--though dimly enough perhaps--that it was not beneficial\\r\\nto anybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert.\\r\\nMy lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not\\r\\nafford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peace\\r\\nwith anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for having\\r\\nunwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor\\r\\narts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural\\r\\nbent, and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them\\r\\nslumbering. But Herbert's was a very different case, and it often caused\\r\\nme a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in crowding his\\r\\nsparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work, and placing\\r\\nthe Canary-breasted Avenger at his disposal.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began\\r\\nto contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Herbert\\r\\nmust begin too, so he soon followed. At Startop's suggestion, we put\\r\\nourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the Grove:\\r\\nthe object of which institution I have never divined, if it were not\\r\\nthat the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to quarrel\\r\\namong themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause six\\r\\nwaiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifying social\\r\\nends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I understood\\r\\nnothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the\\r\\nsociety: which ran Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGentlemen, may the present promotion of good feeling\\r\\never reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Finches spent their money foolishly (the Hotel we dined at was\\r\\nin Covent Garden), and the first Finch I saw when I had the honor of\\r\\njoining the Grove was Bentley Drummle, at that time floundering about\\r\\ntown in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts\\r\\nat the street corners. Occasionally, he shot himself out of his equipage\\r\\nheadforemost over the apron; and I saw him on one occasion deliver\\r\\nhimself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way--like coals.\\r\\nBut here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and could not be,\\r\\naccording to the sacred laws of the society, until I came of age.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken\\r\\nHerbert's expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make\\r\\nno such proposal to him. So he got into difficulties in every direction,\\r\\nand continued to look about him. When we gradually fell into keeping\\r\\nlate hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about him with a\\r\\ndesponding eye at breakfast-time; that he began to look about him more\\r\\nhopefully about mid-day; that he drooped when he came into dinner;\\r\\nthat he seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather clearly, after\\r\\ndinner; that he all but realized Capital towards midnight; and that at\\r\\nabout two o'clock in the morning, he became so deeply despondent again\\r\\nas to talk of buying a rifle and going to America, with a general\\r\\npurpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at\\r\\nHammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by. Herbert\\r\\nwould often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those\\r\\nseasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that\\r\\nthe opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet. But in the general\\r\\ntumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere, was\\r\\na thing to transact itself somehow. In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew\\r\\ngrayer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the\\r\\nhair. While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool, read\\r\\nher book of dignities, lost her pocket-handkerchief, told us about her\\r\\ngrandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting it into\\r\\nbed whenever it attracted her notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing\\r\\nmy way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at once completing\\r\\nthe description of our usual manners and customs at Barnard's Inn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people\\r\\ncould make up their minds to give us. We were always more or less\\r\\nmiserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.\\r\\nThere was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying\\r\\nourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the best of my\\r\\nbelief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look\\r\\nabout him. I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which\\r\\nhe consorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an\\r\\nalmanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I\\r\\never saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all did what\\r\\nwe undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a\\r\\nRepublic of the Virtues. He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except\\r\\nat a certain hour of every afternoon to Ã¢\\x80\\x9cgo to Lloyd'sÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--in observance\\r\\nof a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. He never did anything\\r\\nelse in connection with Lloyd's that I could find out, except come back\\r\\nagain. When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positively\\r\\nmust find an opening, he would go on 'Change at a busy time, and walk in\\r\\nand out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the assembled\\r\\nmagnates. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFor,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on one\\r\\nof those special occasions, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI find the truth to be, Handel, that an\\r\\nopening won't come to one, but one must go to it,--so I have been.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated\\r\\none another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyond\\r\\nexpression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the\\r\\nsight of the Avenger's livery; which had a more expensive and a\\r\\nless remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the\\r\\nfour-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfast\\r\\nbecame a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at\\r\\nbreakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnot\\r\\nunwholly unconnected,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d as my local paper might put it, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwith jewelery,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake\\r\\nhim off his feet,--so that he was actually in the air, like a booted\\r\\nCupid,--for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt certain times--meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our\\r\\nhumor--I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear Herbert, we are getting on badly.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear Handel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif you will\\r\\nbelieve me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange coincidence.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen, Herbert,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I would respond, Ã¢\\x80\\x9clet us look into our affairs.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for\\r\\nthis purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way to\\r\\nconfront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And\\r\\nI know Herbert thought so too.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of\\r\\nsomething similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds might\\r\\nbe fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the mark.\\r\\nDinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of ink, and\\r\\na goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was something\\r\\nvery comfortable in having plenty of stationery.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in a\\r\\nneat hand, the heading, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMemorandum of Pip's debtsÃ¢\\x80\\x9d; with Barnard's Inn\\r\\nand the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet of\\r\\npaper, and write across it with similar formalities, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMemorandum of\\r\\nHerbert's debts.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side,\\r\\nwhich had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half\\r\\nburnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and\\r\\notherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly,\\r\\ninsomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this\\r\\nedifying business proceeding and actually paying the money. In point of\\r\\nmeritorious character, the two things seemed about equal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?\\r\\nHerbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful\\r\\nmanner at the sight of his accumulating figures.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey are mounting up, Handel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Herbert would say; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cupon my life, they\\r\\nare mounting up.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBe firm, Herbert,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I would retort, plying my own pen with great\\r\\nassiduity. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLook the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare\\r\\nthem out of countenance.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo I would, Handel, only they are staring me out of countenance.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would\\r\\nfall to work again. After a time he would give up once more, on the plea\\r\\nthat he had not got Cobbs's bill, or Lobbs's, or Nobbs's, as the case\\r\\nmight be.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it\\r\\ndown.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat a fellow of resource you are!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d my friend would reply, with\\r\\nadmiration. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cReally your business powers are very remarkable.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions,\\r\\nthe reputation of a first-rate man of business,--prompt, decisive,\\r\\nenergetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities\\r\\ndown upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My\\r\\nself-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.\\r\\nWhen I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,\\r\\ndocketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical\\r\\nbundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had not my\\r\\nadministrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs into a\\r\\nfocus for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy business habits had one other bright feature, which I called Ã¢\\x80\\x9cleaving\\r\\na Margin.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d For example; supposing Herbert's debts to be one hundred and\\r\\nsixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLeave a margin, and\\r\\nput them down at two hundred.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Or, supposing my own to be four times as\\r\\nmuch, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven hundred. I had\\r\\nthe highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin, but I am bound\\r\\nto acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have been an expensive\\r\\ndevice. For, we always ran into new debt immediately, to the full extent\\r\\nof the margin, and sometimes, in the sense of freedom and solvency it\\r\\nimparted, got pretty far on into another margin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these\\r\\nexaminations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable\\r\\nopinion of myself. Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert's\\r\\ncompliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the\\r\\ntable before me among the stationery, and feel like a Bank of some sort,\\r\\nrather than a private individual.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we might\\r\\nnot be interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state one evening, when\\r\\nwe heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door, and fall on\\r\\nthe ground. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt's for you, Handel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, going out and coming\\r\\nback with it, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I hope there is nothing the matter.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d This was in\\r\\nallusion to its heavy black seal and border.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letter was signed Trabb & Co., and its contents were simply, that\\r\\nI was an honored sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J.\\r\\nGargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past six\\r\\nin the evening, and that my attendance was requested at the interment on\\r\\nMonday next at three o'clock in the afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXXV\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and\\r\\nthe gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of my\\r\\nsister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That\\r\\nthe place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemed\\r\\nunable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or never been in my\\r\\nthoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming\\r\\ntowards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at the door.\\r\\nIn my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated, there\\r\\nwas at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the\\r\\nsound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if she were\\r\\nstill alive and had been often there.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my\\r\\nsister with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regret\\r\\nwhich may exist without much tenderness. Under its influence (and\\r\\nperhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling) I was seized with\\r\\na violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered\\r\\nso much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have revengefully\\r\\npursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving written to Joe, to offer him consolation, and to assure him\\r\\nthat I would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in\\r\\nthe curious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the\\r\\nmorning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the\\r\\nforge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times\\r\\nwhen I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me,\\r\\nvividly returned. But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that\\r\\nsoftened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very breath of the beans\\r\\nand clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would\\r\\nbe well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be\\r\\nsoftened as they thought of me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co. had\\r\\nput in a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismally absurd\\r\\npersons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black\\r\\nbandage,--as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort\\r\\nto anybody,--were posted at the front door; and in one of them I\\r\\nrecognized a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young couple\\r\\ninto a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of intoxication\\r\\nrendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck\\r\\nwith both arms. All the children of the village, and most of the women,\\r\\nwere admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house\\r\\nand forge; and as I came up, one of the two warders (the postboy)\\r\\nknocked at the door,--implying that I was far too much exhausted by\\r\\ngrief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother sable warder (a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a\\r\\nwager) opened the door, and showed me into the best parlor. Here, Mr.\\r\\nTrabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves\\r\\nup, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity\\r\\nof black pins. At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished putting\\r\\nsomebody's hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby; so he held\\r\\nout his hand for mine. But I, misled by the action, and confused by the\\r\\noccasion, shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow\\r\\nunder his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where,\\r\\nas chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb. When I bent\\r\\ndown and said to him, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDear Joe, how are you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPip, old chap,\\r\\nyou knowed her when she were a fine figure of a--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and clasped my hand\\r\\nand said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietly\\r\\nhere and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as\\r\\nI thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and\\r\\nthere began to wonder in what part of the house it--she--my sister--was.\\r\\nThe air of the parlor being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, I looked\\r\\nabout for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible until one\\r\\nhad got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum cake upon\\r\\nit, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and biscuits, and two\\r\\ndecanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had never seen used\\r\\nin all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry. Standing at this\\r\\ntable, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook in a black cloak\\r\\nand several yards of hatband, who was alternately stuffing himself,\\r\\nand making obsequious movements to catch my attention. The moment he\\r\\nsucceeded, he came over to me (breathing sherry and crumbs), and said\\r\\nin a subdued voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMay I, dear sir?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and did. I then descried Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner.\\r\\nWe were all going to Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfollow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and were all in course of being tied up\\r\\nseparately (by Trabb) into ridiculous bundles.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich I meantersay, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr.\\r\\nTrabb called Ã¢\\x80\\x9cformedÃ¢\\x80\\x9d in the parlor, two and two,--and it was dreadfully\\r\\nlike a preparation for some grim kind of dance; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhich I meantersay,\\r\\nsir, as I would in preference have carried her to the church myself,\\r\\nalong with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts\\r\\nand arms, but it were considered wot the neighbors would look down on\\r\\nsuch and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPocket-handkerchiefs out, all!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a\\r\\ndepressed business-like voice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPocket-handkerchiefs out! We are ready!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our\\r\\nnoses were bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and\\r\\nPumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister had been\\r\\nbrought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of Undertaking\\r\\nceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a\\r\\nhorrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole looked like\\r\\na blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and blundering along,\\r\\nunder the guidance of two keepers,--the postboy and his comrade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and we\\r\\nwere much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful and\\r\\nvigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off,\\r\\nand lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At such times\\r\\nthe more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our\\r\\nemergence round some corner of expectancy, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHere they come!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHere they\\r\\nare!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and we were all but cheered. In this progress I was much annoyed\\r\\nby the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted all the way\\r\\nas a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband, and smoothing\\r\\nmy cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in\\r\\nbeing members of so distinguished a procession.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the\\r\\nships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard,\\r\\nclose to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this\\r\\nparish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above. And there, my sister was\\r\\nlaid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the\\r\\nlight wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing,\\r\\nI desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that even\\r\\nwhen those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought\\r\\nnothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how it fleeth like\\r\\na shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard him cough a\\r\\nreservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into\\r\\nlarge property. When we got back, he had the hardihood to tell me that\\r\\nhe wished my sister could have known I had done her so much honor, and\\r\\nto hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the\\r\\nprice of her death. After that, he drank all the rest of the sherry,\\r\\nand Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two talked (which I have since\\r\\nobserved to be customary in such cases) as if they were of quite another\\r\\nrace from the deceased, and were notoriously immortal. Finally, he went\\r\\naway with Mr. and Mrs. Hubble,--to make an evening of it, I felt sure,\\r\\nand to tell the Jolly Bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes\\r\\nand my earliest benefactor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were all gone, and when Trabb and his men--but not his Boy; I\\r\\nlooked for him--had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too,\\r\\nthe house felt wholesomer. Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a\\r\\ncold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlor, not in the old\\r\\nkitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his\\r\\nknife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great\\r\\nrestraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe,\\r\\nand when I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat down\\r\\ntogether on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better. I\\r\\nnoticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far, as to\\r\\nmake a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress; in which\\r\\nthe dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little\\r\\nroom, and I was pleased too; for I felt that I had done rather a great\\r\\nthing in making the request. When the shadows of evening were closing\\r\\nin, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a\\r\\nlittle talk.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think you might have written to me about these sad\\r\\nmatters.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you, Mr. Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should have written if I had thought\\r\\nthat.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDon't suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider\\r\\nthat you ought to have thought that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you, Mr. Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with\\r\\nher, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again. After\\r\\nlooking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I gave up\\r\\nthat point.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy dear?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh! I can't do so, Mr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy, in a tone of regret but still\\r\\nof quiet conviction. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I am\\r\\ngoing to her to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care of Mr.\\r\\nGargery, together, until he settles down.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow am I going to live?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary\\r\\nflush upon her face. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'll tell you, Mr. Pip. I am going to try to get\\r\\nthe place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here. I can be\\r\\nwell recommended by all the neighbors, and I hope I can be industrious\\r\\nand patient, and teach myself while I teach others. You know, Mr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe new\\r\\nschools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you after\\r\\nthat time, and have had time since then to improve.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh! Except in my bad side of human nature,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d murmured Biddy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well!\\r\\nI thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little further\\r\\nwith Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have not heard the particulars of my sister's death, Biddy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey are very slight, poor thing. She had been in one of her bad\\r\\nstates--though they had got better of late, rather than worse--for four\\r\\ndays, when she came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, and said\\r\\nquite plainly, 'Joe.' As she had never said any word for a long while, I\\r\\nran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. She made signs to me that\\r\\nshe wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me to put her arms\\r\\nround his neck. So I put them round his neck, and she laid her head down\\r\\non his shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so she presently said\\r\\n'Joe' again, and once 'Pardon,' and once 'Pip.' And so she never lifted\\r\\nher head up any more, and it was just an hour later when we laid it down\\r\\non her own bed, because we found she was gone.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBiddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that were\\r\\ncoming out, were blurred in my own sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNothing was ever discovered, Biddy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNothing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you know what is become of Orlick?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the\\r\\nquarries.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf course you have seen him then?--Why are you looking at that dark\\r\\ntree in the lane?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI saw him there, on the night she died.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat was not the last time either, Biddy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.--It is of\\r\\nno use,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running\\r\\nout, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, and\\r\\nhe is gone.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by\\r\\nthis fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and told\\r\\nher that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of\\r\\nthat country. By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and she\\r\\ntold me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,--she\\r\\ndidn't say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant,--but ever did\\r\\nhis duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a\\r\\ngentle heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIndeed, it would be hard to say too much for him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand Biddy,\\r\\nwe must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often down\\r\\nhere now. I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBiddy said never a single word.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy, don't you hear me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Mr. Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot to mention your calling me Mr. Pip,--which appears to me to be in\\r\\nbad taste, Biddy,--what do you mean?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do I mean?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Biddy, timidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI must request\\r\\nto know what you mean by this?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBy this?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, don't echo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I retorted. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou used not to echo, Biddy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUsed not!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cO Mr. Pip! Used!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWell! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After another\\r\\nsilent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI made a remark respecting my coming down here often,\\r\\nto see Joe, which you received with a marked silence. Have the goodness,\\r\\nBiddy, to tell me why.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked\\r\\nBiddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the\\r\\nstars with a clear and honest eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO dear me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in\\r\\ndespair. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThis really is a very bad side of human nature! Don't say any\\r\\nmore, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and\\r\\nwhen I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of her\\r\\nas I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the churchyard\\r\\nand the event of the day. As often as I was restless in the night, and\\r\\nthat was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an unkindness, what\\r\\nan injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, and\\r\\nlooking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There\\r\\nI stood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of\\r\\nhealth and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun\\r\\nof the life in store for him were shining on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood-bye, dear Joe!--No, don't wipe it off--for God's sake, give me your\\r\\nblackened hand!--I shall be down soon and often.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNever too soon, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand never too often, Pip!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBiddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk and\\r\\na crust of bread. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, when I gave her my hand at parting,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am not angry, but I am hurt.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, don't be hurt,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she pleaded quite pathetically; Ã¢\\x80\\x9clet only me be\\r\\nhurt, if I have been ungenerous.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to\\r\\nme, as I suspect they did, that I should not come back, and that Biddy\\r\\nwas quite right, all I can say is,--they were quite right too.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXXVI\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing our\\r\\ndebts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like exemplary\\r\\ntransactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he has a way of doing;\\r\\nand I came of age,--in fulfilment of Herbert's prediction, that I should\\r\\ndo so before I knew where I was.\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert himself had come of age eight months before me. As he had\\r\\nnothing else than his majority to come into, the event did not make a\\r\\nprofound sensation in Barnard's Inn. But we had looked forward to\\r\\nmy one-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and\\r\\nanticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly\\r\\nhelp saying something definite on that occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my\\r\\nbirthday was. On the day before it, I received an official note from\\r\\nWemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call\\r\\nupon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day. This convinced\\r\\nus that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusual\\r\\nflutter when I repaired to my guardian's office, a model of punctuality.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and\\r\\nincidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of\\r\\ntissue-paper that I liked the look of. But he said nothing respecting\\r\\nit, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian's room. It was November,\\r\\nand my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against\\r\\nthe chimney-piece, with his hands under his coattails.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI must call you Mr. Pip to-day. Congratulations,\\r\\nMr. Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shook hands,--he was always a remarkably short shaker,--and I thanked\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTake a chair, Mr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said my guardian.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his\\r\\nboots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time when\\r\\nI had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the shelf\\r\\nwere not far from him, and their expression was as if they were making a\\r\\nstupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow my young friend,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the\\r\\nbox, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am going to have a word or two with you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you please, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you suppose,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the\\r\\nground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat\\r\\ndo you suppose you are living at the rate of?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt the rate of, sir?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cthe--rate--of?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And then looked all round the room, and paused with his\\r\\npocket-handkerchief in his hand, half-way to his nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed\\r\\nany slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,\\r\\nI confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply\\r\\nseemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI thought so!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and blew his\\r\\nnose with an air of satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, I have asked you a question, my friend,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHave\\r\\nyou anything to ask me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several\\r\\nquestions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAsk one,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. Ask another.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs that confidence to be imparted to me soon?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWaive that, a moment,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand ask another.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from\\r\\nthe inquiry, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHave-I--anything to receive, sir?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d On that, Mr. Jaggers\\r\\nsaid, triumphantly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI thought we should come to it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and called to\\r\\nWemmick to give him that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it in,\\r\\nand disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Mr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cattend, if you please. You have been\\r\\ndrawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick's\\r\\ncash-book; but you are in debt, of course?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am afraid I must say yes, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know you must say yes; don't you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't ask you what you owe, because you don't know; and if you did\\r\\nknow, you wouldn't tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n cried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show\\r\\nof protesting: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit's likely enough that you think you wouldn't, but\\r\\nyou would. You'll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this\\r\\npiece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it\\r\\nand tell me what it is.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is a bank-note,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor five hundred pounds.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat is a bank-note,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated Mr. Jaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor five hundred pounds.\\r\\nAnd a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow could I do otherwise!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh! But answer the question,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUndoubtedly.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that\\r\\nhandsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this\\r\\nday, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome\\r\\nsum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until the\\r\\ndonor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your money\\r\\naffairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from Wemmick\\r\\none hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are in\\r\\ncommunication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere\\r\\nagent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my\\r\\ninstructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but\\r\\nI am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great\\r\\nliberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am\\r\\nnot paid, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, coolly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto carry your words to any one;Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and\\r\\nthen gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the subject, and\\r\\nstood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a pause, I hinted,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to\\r\\nwaive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nI might have known that he would never help me out; but it took me aback\\r\\nto have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIs it\\r\\nlikely,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I said, after hesitating, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat my patron, the fountain-head\\r\\nyou have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d there I delicately\\r\\nstopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWill soon what?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Mr. Jaggers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThat's no question as it stands,\\r\\nyou know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWill soon come to London,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, after casting about for a precise\\r\\nform of words, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cor summon me anywhere else?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with\\r\\nhis dark deep-set eyes, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe must revert to the evening when we first\\r\\nencountered one another in your village. What did I tell you then, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that person\\r\\nappeared.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cJust so,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat's my answer.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my\\r\\nstrong desire to get something out of him. And as I felt that it came\\r\\nquicker, and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that I\\r\\nhad less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Jaggers shook his head,--not in negativing the question, but in\\r\\naltogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer\\r\\nit,--and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when\\r\\nmy eyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their\\r\\nsuspended attention, and were going to sneeze.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCome!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backs\\r\\nof his warmed hands, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'll be plain with you, my friend Pip. That's a\\r\\nquestion I must not be asked. You'll understand that better, when I tell\\r\\nyou it's a question that might compromise me. Come! I'll go a little\\r\\nfurther with you; I'll say something more.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub the\\r\\ncalves of his legs in the pause he made.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen that person discloses,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cyou and that person will settle your own affairs. When that person\\r\\ndiscloses, my part in this business will cease and determine. When that\\r\\nperson discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything about\\r\\nit. And that's all I have got to say.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked\\r\\nthoughtfully at the floor. From this last speech I derived the notion\\r\\nthat Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken him\\r\\ninto her confidence as to her designing me for Estella; that he resented\\r\\nthis, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he really did object to\\r\\nthat scheme, and would have nothing to do with it. When I raised my eyes\\r\\nagain, I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time, and\\r\\nwas doing so still.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf that is all you have to say, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I remarked, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthere can be nothing\\r\\nleft for me to say.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded assent, and pulled out his thief-dreaded watch, and asked me\\r\\nwhere I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.\\r\\nAs a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would favor us with his\\r\\ncompany, and he promptly accepted the invitation. But he insisted on\\r\\nwalking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation\\r\\nfor him, and first he had a letter or two to write, and (of course) had\\r\\nhis hands to wash. So I said I would go into the outer office and talk\\r\\nto Wemmick.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket,\\r\\na thought had come into my head which had been often there before;\\r\\nand it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise with\\r\\nconcerning such thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had already locked up his safe, and made preparations for going home.\\r\\nHe had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and\\r\\nstood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door, ready to\\r\\nbe extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put his hat and great-coat\\r\\nready, and was beating himself all over the chest with his safe-key, as\\r\\nan athletic exercise after business.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Wemmick,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous\\r\\nto serve a friend.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion\\r\\nwere dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis friend,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I pursued, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis trying to get on in commercial life,\\r\\nbut has no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a\\r\\nbeginning. Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWith money down?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWith some money down,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot across\\r\\nme of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwith some money down,\\r\\nand perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should like just to run over with you on my\\r\\nfingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high\\r\\nas Chelsea Reach. Let's see; there's London, one; Southwark, two;\\r\\nBlackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n He had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his\\r\\nsafe-key on the palm of his hand. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere's as many as six, you see, to\\r\\nchoose from.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't understand you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cChoose your bridge, Mr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand take a walk upon\\r\\nyour bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch\\r\\nof your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and\\r\\nyou may know the end of it too,--but it's a less pleasant and profitable\\r\\nend.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide after\\r\\nsaying this.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is very discouraging,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMeant to be so,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen is it your opinion,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I inquired, with some little indignation,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cthat a man should never--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c--Invest portable property in a friend?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCertainly\\r\\nhe should not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend,--and then it\\r\\nbecomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid\\r\\nof him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis my deliberate opinion in this office.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole\\r\\nhere; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut would that be your opinion at Walworth?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied, with gravity, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWalworth is one place, and this\\r\\noffice is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is\\r\\nanother. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments\\r\\nmust be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken\\r\\nin this office.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery well,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, much relieved, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthen I shall look you up at\\r\\nWalworth, you may depend upon it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou will be welcome there, in a private and\\r\\npersonal capacity.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my guardian's\\r\\nears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared in his doorway,\\r\\ntowelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat and stood by to snuff\\r\\nout the candles. We all three went into the street together, and from\\r\\nthe door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr. Jaggers and I turned ours.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers\\r\\nhad had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or\\r\\na Somebody, to unbend his brows a little. It was an uncomfortable\\r\\nconsideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all\\r\\nseemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he\\r\\nmade of it. He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than\\r\\nWemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to\\r\\ndinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy, because,\\r\\nafter he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes fixed on the\\r\\nfire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the\\r\\ndetails of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXXVII\\r\\n\\r\\nDeeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick's Walworth\\r\\nsentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage\\r\\nto the Castle. On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union\\r\\nJack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of\\r\\ndefiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most\\r\\npacific manner by the Aged.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy son, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, Ã¢\\x80\\x9crather\\r\\nhad it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left word\\r\\nthat he would soon be home from his afternoon's walk. He is very regular\\r\\nin his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my son.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and\\r\\nwe went in and sat down by the fireside.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou made acquaintance with my son, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the old man, in his\\r\\nchirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cat his office, I\\r\\nexpect?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I nodded. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at\\r\\nhis business, sir?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I nodded hard. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes; so they tell me. His business\\r\\nis the Law?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I nodded harder. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhich makes it more surprising in my\\r\\nson,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the old man, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor he was not brought up to the Law, but to\\r\\nthe Wine-Coopering.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCurious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the\\r\\nreputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He threw me into\\r\\nthe greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very\\r\\nsprightly manner, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo, to be sure; you're right.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And to this hour I\\r\\nhave not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought I\\r\\nhad made.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making\\r\\nsome other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether his own\\r\\ncalling in life had been Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe Wine-Coopering.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d By dint of straining that\\r\\nterm out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the\\r\\nchest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making my meaning\\r\\nunderstood.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the old gentleman; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe warehousing, the warehousing. First,\\r\\nover yonder;Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he\\r\\nintended to refer me to Liverpool; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand then in the City of London here.\\r\\nHowever, having an infirmity--for I am hard of hearing, sir--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c--Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he\\r\\nwent into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little and little\\r\\nmade out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to what you\\r\\nsaid, you know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pursued the old man, again laughing heartily, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat I\\r\\nsay is, No to be sure; you're right.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled\\r\\nme to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this\\r\\nimaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall\\r\\non one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little\\r\\nwooden flap with Ã¢\\x80\\x9cJOHNÃ¢\\x80\\x9d upon it. The old man, following my eyes, cried\\r\\nwith great triumph, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMy son's come home!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and we both went out to the\\r\\ndrawbridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the\\r\\nother side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with\\r\\nthe greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge,\\r\\nthat I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick had\\r\\ncome across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom he\\r\\nwas accompanied.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, in\\r\\nthe post-office branch of the service. She might have been some two or\\r\\nthree years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessed\\r\\nof portable property. The cut of her dress from the waist upward, both\\r\\nbefore and behind, made her figure very like a boy's kite; and I might\\r\\nhave pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her gloves a\\r\\nlittle too intensely green. But she seemed to be a good sort of fellow,\\r\\nand showed a high regard for the Aged. I was not long in discovering\\r\\nthat she was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on our going in,\\r\\nand my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing\\r\\nhimself to the Aged, he begged me to give my attention for a moment to\\r\\nthe other side of the chimney, and disappeared. Presently another click\\r\\ncame, and another little door tumbled open with Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMiss SkiffinsÃ¢\\x80\\x9d on it;\\r\\nthen Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then Miss Skiffins\\r\\nand John both tumbled open together, and finally shut up together. On\\r\\nWemmick's return from working these mechanical appliances, I expressed\\r\\nthe great admiration with which I regarded them, and he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, you\\r\\nknow, they're both pleasant and useful to the Aged. And by George, sir,\\r\\nit's a thing worth mentioning, that of all the people who come to\\r\\nthis gate, the secret of those pulls is only known to the Aged, Miss\\r\\nSkiffins, and me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd Mr. Wemmick made them,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d added Miss Skiffins, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwith his own hands\\r\\nout of his own head.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet (she retained her green\\r\\ngloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was\\r\\ncompany), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property,\\r\\nand see how the island looked in wintertime. Thinking that he did this\\r\\nto give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I seized\\r\\nthe opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I\\r\\nhad never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in\\r\\nbehalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how\\r\\nwe had fought. I glanced at Herbert's home, and at his character, and\\r\\nat his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;\\r\\nthose, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had\\r\\nderived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I\\r\\nconfessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might\\r\\nhave done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham\\r\\nin the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the possibility\\r\\nof my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the certainty of\\r\\nhis possessing a generous soul, and being far above any mean distrusts,\\r\\nretaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told Wemmick),\\r\\nand because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a great\\r\\naffection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays\\r\\nupon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick's experience and\\r\\nknowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my resources to\\r\\nhelp Herbert to some present income,--say of a hundred a year, to keep\\r\\nhim in good hope and heart,--and gradually to buy him on to some small\\r\\npartnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to understand that my help\\r\\nmust always be rendered without Herbert's knowledge or suspicion, and\\r\\nthat there was no one else in the world with whom I could advise. I\\r\\nwound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder, and saying, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI can't help\\r\\nconfiding in you, though I know it must be troublesome to you; but that\\r\\nis your fault, in having ever brought me here.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of\\r\\nstart, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This is\\r\\ndevilish good of you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSay you'll help me to be good then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEcod,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied Wemmick, shaking his head, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat's not my trade.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNor is this your trading-place,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou hit the nail on the head. Mr. Pip,\\r\\nI'll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may be\\r\\ndone by degrees. Skiffins (that's her brother) is an accountant and\\r\\nagent. I'll look him up and go to work for you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI thank you ten thousand times.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI thank you, for though we are strictly in\\r\\nour private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there\\r\\nare Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned into\\r\\nthe Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea. The responsible\\r\\nduty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and that excellent\\r\\nold gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger\\r\\nof melting his eyes. It was no nominal meal that we were going to make,\\r\\nbut a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such a hay-stack of buttered\\r\\ntoast, that I could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron\\r\\nstand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss Skiffins brewed such a jorum\\r\\nof tea, that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited, and\\r\\nrepeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right\\r\\nmoment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth\\r\\nas if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing disturbed\\r\\nthe tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of\\r\\nJohn and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic\\r\\ninfirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I got used\\r\\nto it. I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss Skiffins's\\r\\narrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; and I rather\\r\\nsuspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the profile of an\\r\\nundesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon, was a\\r\\npiece of portable property that had been given her by Wemmick.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was\\r\\ndelightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The Aged\\r\\nespecially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage\\r\\ntribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins--in the\\r\\nabsence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of\\r\\nher family on Sunday afternoons--washed up the tea-things, in a trifling\\r\\nlady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, she put on\\r\\nher gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow,\\r\\nAged Parent, tip us the paper.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, that this\\r\\nwas according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman infinite\\r\\nsatisfaction to read the news aloud. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI won't offer an apology,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nWemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor he isn't capable of many pleasures--are you, Aged P.?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAll right, John, all right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the old man, seeing himself\\r\\nspoken to.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOnly tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand he'll be as happy as a king. We are all attention,\\r\\nAged One.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAll right, John, all right!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the cheerful old man, so busy and\\r\\nso pleased, that it really was quite charming.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Aged's reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle's\\r\\ngreat-aunt's, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come\\r\\nthrough a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was\\r\\nalways on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into\\r\\nthem, he required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was\\r\\nequally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,\\r\\nquite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we\\r\\nall expressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he\\r\\nresumed again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a shadowy\\r\\ncorner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr. Wemmick's mouth,\\r\\npowerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round\\r\\nMiss Skiffins's waist. In course of time I saw his hand appear on the\\r\\nother side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment Miss Skiffins neatly\\r\\nstopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm again as if it were\\r\\nan article of dress, and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the\\r\\ntable before her. Miss Skiffins's composure while she did this was one\\r\\nof the most remarkable sights I have ever seen, and if I could have\\r\\nthought the act consistent with abstraction of mind, I should have\\r\\ndeemed that Miss Skiffins performed it mechanically.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by, I noticed Wemmick's arm beginning to disappear again, and\\r\\ngradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to\\r\\nwiden again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite\\r\\nenthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side\\r\\nof Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness\\r\\nof a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid\\r\\nit on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am\\r\\njustified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged's reading,\\r\\nWemmick's arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to\\r\\nit by Miss Skiffins.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the time\\r\\nfor Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a\\r\\nblack bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical\\r\\ndignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these\\r\\nappliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, who\\r\\nwas soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and\\r\\nWemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better than to offer to\\r\\nsee Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had best\\r\\ngo first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and having\\r\\npassed a pleasant evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,\\r\\nstating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter\\r\\nappertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would\\r\\nbe glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out\\r\\nto Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by\\r\\nappointment in the City several times, but never held any communication\\r\\nwith him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was,\\r\\nthat we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long\\r\\nestablished in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted\\r\\ncapital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner.\\r\\nBetween him and me, secret articles were signed of which Herbert was the\\r\\nsubject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds down, and engaged\\r\\nfor sundry other payments: some, to fall due at certain dates out of my\\r\\nincome: some, contingent on my coming into my property. Miss Skiffins's\\r\\nbrother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick pervaded it throughout, but\\r\\nnever appeared in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the\\r\\nleast suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the radiant\\r\\nface with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a mighty\\r\\npiece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (the young\\r\\nmerchant's name), and of Clarriker's having shown an extraordinary\\r\\ninclination towards him, and of his belief that the opening had come at\\r\\nlast. Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter, he\\r\\nmust have thought me a more and more affectionate friend, for I had the\\r\\ngreatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when I saw him so\\r\\nhappy. At length, the thing being done, and he having that day entered\\r\\nClarriker's House, and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a\\r\\nflush of pleasure and success, I did really cry in good earnest when\\r\\nI went to bed, to think that my expectations had done some good to\\r\\nsomebody.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my\\r\\nview. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all\\r\\nthe changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella. It is not\\r\\nmuch to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nIf that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to\\r\\nbe haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost. O\\r\\nthe many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within\\r\\nme haunted that house when Estella lived there! Let my body be where it\\r\\nwould, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about that\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a\\r\\nwidow, with one daughter several years older than Estella. The mother\\r\\nlooked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother's complexion was\\r\\npink, and the daughter's was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity,\\r\\nand the daughter for theology. They were in what is called a good\\r\\nposition, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people. Little,\\r\\nif any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but the\\r\\nunderstanding was established that they were necessary to her, and\\r\\nthat she was necessary to them. Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss\\r\\nHavisham's before the time of her seclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Mrs. Brandley's house and out of Mrs. Brandley's house, I suffered\\r\\nevery kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me. The\\r\\nnature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms of familiarity\\r\\nwithout placing me on terms of favor, conduced to my distraction.\\r\\nShe made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turned the very\\r\\nfamiliarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant\\r\\nslight on my devotion to her. If I had been her secretary, steward,\\r\\nhalf-brother, poor relation,--if I had been a younger brother of her\\r\\nappointed husband,--I could not have seemed to myself further from my\\r\\nhopes when I was nearest to her. The privilege of calling her by her\\r\\nname and hearing her call me by mine became, under the circumstances\\r\\nan aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely that it almost\\r\\nmaddened her other lovers, I know too certainly that it almost maddened\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had admirers without end. No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of\\r\\nevery one who went near her; but there were more than enough of them\\r\\nwithout that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I used\\r\\noften to take her and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics,\\r\\nfÃÂªte days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures,\\r\\nthrough which I pursued her,--and they were all miseries to me. I never\\r\\nhad one hour's happiness in her society, and yet my mind all round the\\r\\nfour-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me\\r\\nunto death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout this part of our intercourse,--and it lasted, as will\\r\\npresently be seen, for what I then thought a long time,--she habitually\\r\\nreverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced\\r\\nupon us. There were other times when she would come to a sudden check in\\r\\nthis tone and in all her many tones, and would seem to pity me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPip, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat\\r\\napart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwill you never\\r\\ntake warning?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf what?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWarning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo I mean! If you don't know what I mean, you are blind.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the\\r\\nreason that I always was restrained--and this was not the least of my\\r\\nmiseries--by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her,\\r\\nwhen she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. My\\r\\ndread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy\\r\\ndisadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious\\r\\nstruggle in her bosom.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt any rate,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have no warning given me just now, for you\\r\\nwrote to me to come to you, this time.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's true,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always\\r\\nchilled me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she went on\\r\\nto say:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day\\r\\nat Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. She\\r\\nwould rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid,\\r\\nfor she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people. Can\\r\\nyou take me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCan I take you, Estella!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to pay\\r\\nall charges out of my purse, You hear the condition of your going?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd must obey,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others\\r\\nlike it; Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as seen\\r\\nher handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and we found her\\r\\nin the room where I had first beheld her, and it is needless to add that\\r\\nthere was no change in Satis House.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when\\r\\nI last saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was\\r\\nsomething positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces.\\r\\nShe hung upon Estella's beauty, hung upon her words, hung upon her\\r\\ngestures, and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked at\\r\\nher, as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to\\r\\npry into my heart and probe its wounds. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow does she use you, Pip; how\\r\\ndoes she use you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked me again, with her witch-like eagerness,\\r\\neven in Estella's hearing. But, when we sat by her flickering fire\\r\\nat night, she was most weird; for then, keeping Estella's hand drawn\\r\\nthrough her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her,\\r\\nby dint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular\\r\\nletters, the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated;\\r\\nand as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind\\r\\nmortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutch\\r\\nstick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, a\\r\\nvery spectre.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of\\r\\ndependence and even of degradation that it awakened,--I saw in this that\\r\\nEstella was set to wreak Miss Havisham's revenge on men, and that she\\r\\nwas not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term. I saw\\r\\nin this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her\\r\\nout to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with\\r\\nthe malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers,\\r\\nand that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw in\\r\\nthis that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even while\\r\\nthe prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason for my being\\r\\nstaved off so long and the reason for my late guardian's declining to\\r\\ncommit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme. In a word, I\\r\\nsaw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there before my eyes,\\r\\nand always had had her before my eyes; and I saw in this, the distinct\\r\\nshadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden\\r\\nfrom the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on\\r\\nthe wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the steady\\r\\ndulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As I looked\\r\\nround at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the stopped\\r\\nclock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and\\r\\nthe ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection\\r\\nthrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I saw in\\r\\neverything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated and\\r\\nthrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room across the\\r\\nlanding where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it were, in\\r\\nthe falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the crawlings of the\\r\\nspiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as they betook their\\r\\nlittle quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the gropings and\\r\\npausings of the beetles on the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose\\r\\nbetween Estella and Miss Havisham. It was the first time I had ever seen\\r\\nthem opposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham\\r\\nstill had Estella's arm drawn through her own, and still clutched\\r\\nEstella's hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.\\r\\nShe had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather\\r\\nendured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, Ã¢\\x80\\x9care you tired\\r\\nof me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOnly a little tired of myself,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied Estella, disengaging her arm,\\r\\nand moving to the great chimney-piece, where she stood looking down at\\r\\nthe fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSpeak the truth, you ingrate!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Havisham, passionately\\r\\nstriking her stick upon the floor; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou are tired of me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEstella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked down\\r\\nat the fire. Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a\\r\\nself-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was\\r\\nalmost cruel.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou stock and stone!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Miss Havisham. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou cold, cold heart!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as she\\r\\nleaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdo you\\r\\nreproach me for being cold? You?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you not?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d was the fierce retort.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou should know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am what you have made me. Take\\r\\nall the praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the\\r\\nfailure; in short, take me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO, look at her, look at her!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Havisham, bitterly; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLook at\\r\\nher so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared! Where I\\r\\ntook her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its\\r\\nstabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt least I was no party to the compact,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor if I could\\r\\nwalk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do. But what\\r\\nwould you have? You have been very good to me, and I owe everything to\\r\\nyou. What would you have?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLove,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou have it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMother by adoption,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d retorted Estella, never departing from the easy\\r\\ngrace of her attitude, never raising her voice as the other did, never\\r\\nyielding either to anger or tenderness,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmother by adoption, I have\\r\\nsaid that I owe everything to you. All I possess is freely yours. All\\r\\nthat you have given me, is at your command to have again. Beyond that, I\\r\\nhave nothing. And if you ask me to give you, what you never gave me, my\\r\\ngratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid I never give her love!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly to me.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid I never give her a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all\\r\\ntimes, and from sharp pain, while she speaks thus to me! Let her call me\\r\\nmad, let her call me mad!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy should I call you mad,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Estella, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI, of all people? Does\\r\\nany one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I\\r\\ndo? Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half\\r\\nas well as I do? I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool\\r\\nthat is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up\\r\\ninto your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSoon forgotten!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d moaned Miss Havisham. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTimes soon forgotten!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, not forgotten,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d retorted Estella,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnot forgotten, but treasured up\\r\\nin my memory. When have you found me false to your teaching? When have\\r\\nyou found me unmindful of your lessons? When have you found me giving\\r\\nadmission here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she touched her bosom with her hand, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto anything that\\r\\nyou excluded? Be just to me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo proud, so proud!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d moaned Miss Havisham, pushing away her gray hair\\r\\nwith both her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWho taught me to be proud?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Estella. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWho praised me when I\\r\\nlearnt my lesson?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo hard, so hard!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d moaned Miss Havisham, with her former action.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWho taught me to be hard?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Estella. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWho praised me when I\\r\\nlearnt my lesson?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut to be proud and hard to me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Miss Havisham quite shrieked, as she\\r\\nstretched out her arms. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cEstella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and hard\\r\\nto me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEstella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was\\r\\nnot otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she looked down at\\r\\nthe fire again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI cannot think,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, raising her eyes after a silence Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhy\\r\\nyou should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation.\\r\\nI have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes. I have never been\\r\\nunfaithful to you or your schooling. I have never shown any weakness\\r\\nthat I can charge myself with.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWould it be weakness to return my love?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Miss Havisham. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut\\r\\nyes, yes, she would call it so!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI begin to think,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, in a musing way, after another moment\\r\\nof calm wonder, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat I almost understand how this comes about. If you\\r\\nhad brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of\\r\\nthese rooms, and had never let her know that there was such a thing as\\r\\nthe daylight by which she had never once seen your face,--if you had\\r\\ndone that, and then, for a purpose had wanted her to understand the\\r\\ndaylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed and\\r\\nangry?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Havisham, with her head in her hands, sat making a low moaning, and\\r\\nswaying herself on her chair, but gave no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOr,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhich is a nearer case,--if you had taught her,\\r\\nfrom the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,\\r\\nthat there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her\\r\\nenemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it had\\r\\nblighted you and would else blight her;--if you had done this, and then,\\r\\nfor a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she\\r\\ncould not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see her\\r\\nface), but still made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI must be taken as I have been made. The success is\\r\\nnot mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor, among\\r\\nthe faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I took advantage of\\r\\nthe moment--I had sought one from the first--to leave the room, after\\r\\nbeseeching Estella's attention to her, with a movement of my hand. When\\r\\nI left, Estella was yet standing by the great chimney-piece, just as she\\r\\nhad stood throughout. Miss Havisham's gray hair was all adrift upon the\\r\\nground, among the other bridal wrecks, and was a miserable sight to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an\\r\\nhour and more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and about\\r\\nthe ruined garden. When I at last took courage to return to the room, I\\r\\nfound Estella sitting at Miss Havisham's knee, taking up some stitches\\r\\nin one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and\\r\\nof which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old\\r\\nbanners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Estella\\r\\nand I played at cards, as of yore,--only we were skilful now, and played\\r\\nFrench games,--and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI lay in that separate building across the courtyard. It was the first\\r\\ntime I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to\\r\\ncome near me. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. She was on this side\\r\\nof my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind the\\r\\nhalf-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in the room\\r\\noverhead, in the room beneath,--everywhere. At last, when the night was\\r\\nslow to creep on towards two o'clock, I felt that I absolutely could no\\r\\nlonger bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I must get up.\\r\\nI therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out across the yard\\r\\ninto the long stone passage, designing to gain the outer courtyard and\\r\\nwalk there for the relief of my mind. But I was no sooner in the passage\\r\\nthan I extinguished my candle; for I saw Miss Havisham going along it\\r\\nin a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I followed her at a distance,\\r\\nand saw her go up the staircase. She carried a bare candle in her hand,\\r\\nwhich she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room,\\r\\nand was a most unearthly object by its light. Standing at the bottom\\r\\nof the staircase, I felt the mildewed air of the feast-chamber, without\\r\\nseeing her open the door, and I heard her walking there, and so across\\r\\ninto her own room, and so across again into that, never ceasing the low\\r\\ncry. After a time, I tried in the dark both to get out, and to go back,\\r\\nbut I could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed\\r\\nme where to lay my hands. During the whole interval, whenever I went to\\r\\nthe bottom of the staircase, I heard her footstep, saw her light pass\\r\\nabove, and heard her ceaseless low cry.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between\\r\\nher and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and\\r\\nthere were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance. Nor,\\r\\ndid Miss Havisham's manner towards Estella in anywise change, except\\r\\nthat I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former\\r\\ncharacteristics.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley\\r\\nDrummle's name upon it; or I would, very gladly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and when\\r\\ngood feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody's agreeing\\r\\nwith anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to order,\\r\\nforasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which, according\\r\\nto the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute's turn to\\r\\ndo that day. I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the\\r\\ndecanters were going round, but as there was no love lost between us,\\r\\nthat might easily be. What was my indignant surprise when he called upon\\r\\nthe company to pledge him to Ã¢\\x80\\x9cEstella!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEstella who?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNever you mind,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d retorted Drummle.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEstella of where?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou are bound to say of where.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Which he\\r\\nwas, as a Finch.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf Richmond, gentlemen,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Drummle, putting me out of the question,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cand a peerless beauty.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch he knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! I\\r\\nwhispered Herbert.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI know that lady,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had\\r\\nbeen honored.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Drummle.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd so do I,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I added, with a scarlet face.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Drummle. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cO, Lord!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the only retort--except glass or crockery--that the heavy\\r\\ncreature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it\\r\\nas if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place\\r\\nand said that I could not but regard it as being like the honorable\\r\\nFinch's impudence to come down to that Grove,--we always talked\\r\\nabout coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of\\r\\nexpression,--down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew\\r\\nnothing. Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by\\r\\nthat? Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew\\r\\nwhere I was to be found.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,\\r\\nafter this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The debate\\r\\nupon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more honorable members\\r\\ntold six more, during the discussion, that they believed they knew where\\r\\nthey were to be found. However, it was decided at last (the Grove being\\r\\na Court of Honor) that if Mr. Drummle would bring never so slight\\r\\na certificate from the lady, importing that he had the honor of her\\r\\nacquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret, as a gentleman and a\\r\\nFinch, for Ã¢\\x80\\x9chaving been betrayed into a warmth which.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Next day was\\r\\nappointed for the production (lest our honor should take cold from\\r\\ndelay), and next day Drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in\\r\\nEstella's hand, that she had had the honor of dancing with him several\\r\\ntimes. This left me no course but to regret that I had been Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbetrayed\\r\\ninto a warmth which,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and on the whole to repudiate, as untenable, the\\r\\nidea that I was to be found anywhere. Drummle and I then sat snorting\\r\\nat one another for an hour, while the Grove engaged in indiscriminate\\r\\ncontradiction, and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to\\r\\nhave gone ahead at an amazing rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannot\\r\\nadequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should\\r\\nshow any favor to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far below\\r\\nthe average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been referable\\r\\nto some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for\\r\\nher, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound.\\r\\nNo doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she had favored; but\\r\\na worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of\\r\\ndistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle\\r\\nhad begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it. A\\r\\nlittle while, and he was always in pursuit of her, and he and I crossed\\r\\none another every day. He held on, in a dull persistent way, and Estella\\r\\nheld him on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement, now almost\\r\\nflattering him, now openly despising him, now knowing him very well, now\\r\\nscarcely remembering who he was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait,\\r\\nhowever, and had the patience of his tribe. Added to that, he had a\\r\\nblockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness,\\r\\nwhich sometimes did him good service,--almost taking the place of\\r\\nconcentration and determined purpose. So, the Spider, doggedly watching\\r\\nEstella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil\\r\\nhimself and drop at the right nick of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond (there used to be Assembly Balls\\r\\nat most places then), where Estella had outshone all other beauties,\\r\\nthis blundering Drummle so hung about her, and with so much toleration\\r\\non her part, that I resolved to speak to her concerning him. I took the\\r\\nnext opportunity; which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to\\r\\ntake her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go.\\r\\nI was with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such\\r\\nplaces.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you tired, Estella?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRather, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou should be.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSay rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to\\r\\nwrite, before I go to sleep.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRecounting to-night's triumph?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSurely a very poor one,\\r\\nEstella.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean? I didn't know there had been any.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEstella,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdo look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is\\r\\nlooking over here at us.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy should I look at him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Estella, with her eyes on me\\r\\ninstead. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,--to use\\r\\nyour words,--that I need look at?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIndeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFor he\\r\\nhas been hovering about you all night.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMoths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied Estella, with a glance\\r\\ntowards him, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I returned; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut cannot the Estella help it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she, laughing, after a moment, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cperhaps. Yes. Anything you\\r\\nlike.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should\\r\\nencourage a man so generally despised as Drummle. You know he is\\r\\ndespised.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know he is as ungainly within as without. A deficient,\\r\\nill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous\\r\\nroll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don't you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she again; and each time she said it, she opened her lovely\\r\\neyes the wider.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it\\r\\nfrom her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell! Then, that is why\\r\\nit makes me wretched.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, if I could have believed that she favored Drummle with any idea of\\r\\nmaking me--me--wretched, I should have been in better heart about it;\\r\\nbut in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of the\\r\\nquestion, that I could believe nothing of the kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, casting her glance over the room, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdon't be foolish\\r\\nabout its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and may be\\r\\nmeant to have. It's not worth discussing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes it is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbecause I cannot bear that people should say, 'she\\r\\nthrows away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest in the\\r\\ncrowd.'Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI can bear it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh! don't be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCalls me proud and inflexible in this breath!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, opening\\r\\nher hands. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a\\r\\nboor!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere is no doubt you do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, something hurriedly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor I have\\r\\nseen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you never\\r\\ngive to--me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you want me then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and\\r\\nserious, if not angry, look, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto deceive and entrap you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you deceive and entrap him, Estella?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, and many others,--all of them but you. Here is Mrs. Brandley. I'll\\r\\nsay no more.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n* *\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my\\r\\nheart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass on unhindered,\\r\\nto the event that had impended over me longer yet; the event that had\\r\\nbegun to be prepared for, before I knew that the world held Estella,\\r\\nand in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving its first\\r\\ndistortions from Miss Havisham's wasting hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Eastern story, the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of\\r\\nstate in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry, the\\r\\ntunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through\\r\\nthe leagues of rock, the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof,\\r\\nthe rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to\\r\\nthe great iron ring. All being made ready with much labor, and the hour\\r\\ncome, the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night, and the sharpened\\r\\naxe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his\\r\\nhand, and he struck with it, and the rope parted and rushed away, and\\r\\nthe ceiling fell. So, in my case; all the work, near and afar, that\\r\\ntended to the end, had been accomplished; and in an instant the blow was\\r\\nstruck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXXIX\\r\\n\\r\\nI was three-and-twenty years of age. Not another word had I heard to\\r\\nenlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twenty-third\\r\\nbirthday was a week gone. We had left Barnard's Inn more than a year,\\r\\nand lived in the Temple. Our chambers were in Garden-court, down by the\\r\\nriver.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original\\r\\nrelations, though we continued on the best terms. Notwithstanding my\\r\\ninability to settle to anything,--which I hope arose out of the restless\\r\\nand incomplete tenure on which I held my means,--I had a taste for\\r\\nreading, and read regularly so many hours a day. That matter of\\r\\nHerbert's was still progressing, and everything with me was as I have\\r\\nbrought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles. I was alone, and\\r\\nhad a dull sense of being alone. Dispirited and anxious, long hoping\\r\\nthat to-morrow or next week would clear my way, and long disappointed, I\\r\\nsadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and mud, mud,\\r\\nmud, deep in all the streets. Day after day, a vast heavy veil had been\\r\\ndriving over London from the East, and it drove still, as if in the East\\r\\nthere were an Eternity of cloud and wind. So furious had been the gusts,\\r\\nthat high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs;\\r\\nand in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of windmills\\r\\ncarried away; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast, of\\r\\nshipwreck and death. Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages\\r\\nof wind, and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been the\\r\\nworst of all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlterations have been made in that part of the Temple since that time,\\r\\nand it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it so\\r\\nexposed to the river. We lived at the top of the last house, and the\\r\\nwind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges\\r\\nof cannon, or breakings of a sea. When the rain came with it and dashed\\r\\nagainst the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they\\r\\nrocked, that I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse.\\r\\nOccasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could\\r\\nnot bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doors open and\\r\\nlooked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out; and when\\r\\nI shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows\\r\\n(opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of\\r\\nsuch wind and rain), I saw that the lamps in the court were blown out,\\r\\nand that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering, and\\r\\nthat the coal-fires in barges on the river were being carried away\\r\\nbefore the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI read with my watch upon the table, purposing to close my book\\r\\nat eleven o'clock. As I shut it, Saint Paul's, and all the many\\r\\nchurch-clocks in the City--some leading, some accompanying, some\\r\\nfollowing--struck that hour. The sound was curiously flawed by the wind;\\r\\nand I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it,\\r\\nwhen I heard a footstep on the stair.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with the\\r\\nfootstep of my dead sister, matters not. It was past in a moment, and I\\r\\nlistened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on.\\r\\nRemembering then, that the staircase-lights were blown out, I took up\\r\\nmy reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head. Whoever was below had\\r\\nstopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere is some one down there, is there not?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I called out, looking\\r\\ndown.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said a voice from the darkness beneath.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat floor do you want?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe top. Mr. Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat is my name.--There is nothing the matter?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNothing the matter,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the voice. And the man came on.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail, and he came slowly\\r\\nwithin its light. It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its\\r\\ncircle of light was very contracted; so that he was in it for a mere\\r\\ninstant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that was\\r\\nstrange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched\\r\\nand pleased by the sight of me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he was substantially\\r\\ndressed, but roughly, like a voyager by sea. That he had long iron-gray\\r\\nhair. That his age was about sixty. That he was a muscular man, strong\\r\\non his legs, and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to\\r\\nweather. As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp\\r\\nincluded us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he was\\r\\nholding out both his hands to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPray what is your business?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy business?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated, pausing. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAh! Yes. I will explain my\\r\\nbusiness, by your leave.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you wish to come in?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wish to come in, master.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had asked him the question inhospitably enough, for I resented the\\r\\nsort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face.\\r\\nI resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond\\r\\nto it. But I took him into the room I had just left, and, having set the\\r\\nlamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could to explain himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked about him with the strangest air,--an air of wondering\\r\\npleasure, as if he had some part in the things he admired,--and he\\r\\npulled off a rough outer coat, and his hat. Then, I saw that his head\\r\\nwas furrowed and bald, and that the long iron-gray hair grew only on\\r\\nits sides. But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him. On the\\r\\ncontrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his hands to\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, half suspecting him to be mad.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped in his looking at me, and slowly rubbed his right hand over\\r\\nhis head. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt's disapinting to a man,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, in a coarse broken\\r\\nvoice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9carter having looked for'ard so distant, and come so fur; but\\r\\nyou're not to blame for that,--neither on us is to blame for that. I'll\\r\\nspeak in half a minute. Give me half a minute, please.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered his\\r\\nforehead with his large brown veinous hands. I looked at him attentively\\r\\nthen, and recoiled a little from him; but I did not know him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere's no one nigh,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, looking over his shoulder; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis there?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night,\\r\\nask that question?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou're a game one,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned, shaking his head at me with a\\r\\ndeliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most exasperating;\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI'm glad you've grow'd up, a game one! But don't catch hold of me.\\r\\nYou'd be sorry arterwards to have done it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI relinquished the intention he had detected, for I knew him! Even yet\\r\\nI could not recall a single feature, but I knew him! If the wind and\\r\\nthe rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all the\\r\\nintervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood\\r\\nface to face on such different levels, I could not have known my convict\\r\\nmore distinctly than I knew him now as he sat in the chair before the\\r\\nfire. No need to take a file from his pocket and show it to me; no need\\r\\nto take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round his head; no\\r\\nneed to hug himself with both his arms, and take a shivering turn across\\r\\nthe room, looking back at me for recognition. I knew him before he gave\\r\\nme one of those aids, though, a moment before, I had not been conscious\\r\\nof remotely suspecting his identity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came back to where I stood, and again held out both his hands.\\r\\nNot knowing what to do,--for, in my astonishment I had lost my\\r\\nself-possession,--I reluctantly gave him my hands. He grasped them\\r\\nheartily, raised them to his lips, kissed them, and still held them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou acted noble, my boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNoble, Pip! And I have never forgot\\r\\nit!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me, I laid\\r\\na hand upon his breast and put him away.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cStay!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cKeep off! If you are grateful to me for what I did when\\r\\nI was a little child, I hope you have shown your gratitude by mending\\r\\nyour way of life. If you have come here to thank me, it was not\\r\\nnecessary. Still, however you have found me out, there must be something\\r\\ngood in the feeling that has brought you here, and I will not repulse\\r\\nyou; but surely you must understand that--I--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at\\r\\nme, that the words died away on my tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou was a saying,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he observed, when we had confronted one another\\r\\nin silence, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat surely I must understand. What, surely must I\\r\\nunderstand?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat I cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long\\r\\nago, under these different circumstances. I am glad to believe you have\\r\\nrepented and recovered yourself. I am glad to tell you so. I am glad\\r\\nthat, thinking I deserve to be thanked, you have come to thank me. But\\r\\nour ways are different ways, none the less. You are wet, and you look\\r\\nweary. Will you drink something before you go?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had replaced his neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenly observant\\r\\nof me, biting a long end of it. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he answered, still with the\\r\\nend at his mouth and still observant of me, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat I will drink (I thank\\r\\nyou) afore I go.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a tray ready on a side-table. I brought it to the table\\r\\nnear the fire, and asked him what he would have? He touched one of the\\r\\nbottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made him some hot rum\\r\\nand water. I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but his look\\r\\nat me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his\\r\\nneckerchief between his teeth--evidently forgotten--made my hand very\\r\\ndifficult to master. When at last I put the glass to him, I saw with\\r\\namazement that his eyes were full of tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nUp to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I wished\\r\\nhim gone. But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man, and felt\\r\\na touch of reproach. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI hope,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, hurriedly putting something into\\r\\na glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat you will not\\r\\nthink I spoke harshly to you just now. I had no intention of doing it,\\r\\nand I am sorry for it if I did. I wish you well and happy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I put my glass to my lips, he glanced with surprise at the end of his\\r\\nneckerchief, dropping from his mouth when he opened it, and stretched\\r\\nout his hand. I gave him mine, and then he drank, and drew his sleeve\\r\\nacross his eyes and forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow are you living?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI've been a sheep-farmer, stock-breeder, other trades besides, away in\\r\\nthe new world,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmany a thousand mile of stormy water off from\\r\\nthis.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI hope you have done well?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI've done wonderfully well. There's others went out alonger me as has\\r\\ndone well too, but no man has done nigh as well as me. I'm famous for\\r\\nit.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am glad to hear it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI hope to hear you say so, my dear boy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which\\r\\nthey were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into my\\r\\nmind.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I inquired, Ã¢\\x80\\x9csince\\r\\nhe undertook that trust?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNever set eyes upon him. I warn't likely to it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe came faithfully, and he brought me the two one-pound notes. I was\\r\\na poor boy then, as you know, and to a poor boy they were a little\\r\\nfortune. But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let me pay\\r\\nthem back. You can put them to some other poor boy's use.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I took out my\\r\\npurse.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it, and he\\r\\nwatched me as I separated two one-pound notes from its contents. They\\r\\nwere clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to\\r\\nhim. Still watching me, he laid them one upon the other, folded them\\r\\nlong-wise, gave them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and dropped\\r\\nthe ashes into the tray.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMay I make so bold,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said then, with a smile that was like a frown,\\r\\nand with a frown that was like a smile, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas ask you how you have done\\r\\nwell, since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe emptied his glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with\\r\\nhis heavy brown hand on the mantel-shelf. He put a foot up to the bars,\\r\\nto dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam; but, he neither\\r\\nlooked at it, nor at the fire, but steadily looked at me. It was only\\r\\nnow that I began to tremble.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were\\r\\nwithout sound, I forced myself to tell him (though I could not do it\\r\\ndistinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMight a mere warmint ask what property?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nI faltered, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMight a mere warmint ask whose property?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nI faltered again, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCould I make a guess, I wonder,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Convict, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cat your income\\r\\nsince you come of age! As to the first figure now. Five?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I rose\\r\\nout of my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of it, looking\\r\\nwildly at him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cConcerning a guardian,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he went on. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere ought to have been some\\r\\nguardian, or such-like, whiles you was a minor. Some lawyer, maybe. As\\r\\nto the first letter of that lawyer's name now. Would it be J?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the truth of my position came flashing on me; and its\\r\\ndisappointments, dangers, disgraces, consequences of all kinds, rushed\\r\\nin in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to struggle\\r\\nfor every breath I drew.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPut it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he resumed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas the employer of that lawyer whose name begun\\r\\nwith a J, and might be Jaggers,--put it as he had come over sea to\\r\\nPortsmouth, and had landed there, and had wanted to come on to you.\\r\\n'However, you have found me out,' you says just now. Well! However, did\\r\\nI find you out? Why, I wrote from Portsmouth to a person in London, for\\r\\nparticulars of your address. That person's name? Why, Wemmick.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life.\\r\\nI stood, with a hand on the chair-back and a hand on my breast, where\\r\\nI seemed to be suffocating,--I stood so, looking wildly at him, until I\\r\\ngrasped at the chair, when the room began to surge and turn. He caught\\r\\nme, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions, and bent on one\\r\\nknee before me, bringing the face that I now well remembered, and that I\\r\\nshuddered at, very near to mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Pip, dear boy, I've made a gentleman on you! It's me wot has\\r\\ndone it! I swore that time, sure as ever I earned a guinea, that guinea\\r\\nshould go to you. I swore arterwards, sure as ever I spec'lated and got\\r\\nrich, you should get rich. I lived rough, that you should live smooth;\\r\\nI worked hard, that you should be above work. What odds, dear boy? Do I\\r\\ntell it, fur you to feel a obligation? Not a bit. I tell it, fur you to\\r\\nknow as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in, got his head\\r\\nso high that he could make a gentleman,--and, Pip, you're him!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him, the\\r\\nrepugnance with which I shrank from him, could not have been exceeded if\\r\\nhe had been some terrible beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLook'ee here, Pip. I'm your second father. You're my son,--more to me\\r\\nnor any son. I've put away money, only for you to spend. When I was a\\r\\nhired-out shepherd in a solitary hut, not seeing no faces but faces of\\r\\nsheep till I half forgot wot men's and women's faces wos like, I see\\r\\nyourn. I drops my knife many a time in that hut when I was a-eating my\\r\\ndinner or my supper, and I says, 'Here's the boy again, a looking at\\r\\nme whiles I eats and drinks!' I see you there a many times, as plain as\\r\\never I see you on them misty marshes. 'Lord strike me dead!' I says each\\r\\ntime,--and I goes out in the air to say it under the open heavens,--'but\\r\\nwot, if I gets liberty and money, I'll make that boy a gentleman!' And\\r\\nI done it. Why, look at you, dear boy! Look at these here lodgings\\r\\no'yourn, fit for a lord! A lord? Ah! You shall show money with lords for\\r\\nwagers, and beat 'em!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his heat and triumph, and in his knowledge that I had been nearly\\r\\nfainting, he did not remark on my reception of all this. It was the one\\r\\ngrain of relief I had.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLook'ee here!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he went on, taking my watch out of my pocket, and\\r\\nturning towards him a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from his\\r\\ntouch as if he had been a snake, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ca gold 'un and a beauty: that's a\\r\\ngentleman's, I hope! A diamond all set round with rubies; that's a\\r\\ngentleman's, I hope! Look at your linen; fine and beautiful! Look at\\r\\nyour clothes; better ain't to be got! And your books too,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d turning his\\r\\neyes round the room, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmounting up, on their shelves, by hundreds! And\\r\\nyou read 'em; don't you? I see you'd been a reading of 'em when I come\\r\\nin. Ha, ha, ha! You shall read 'em to me, dear boy! And if they're in\\r\\nforeign languages wot I don't understand, I shall be just as proud as if\\r\\nI did.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain he took both my hands and put them to his lips, while my blood ran\\r\\ncold within me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDon't you mind talking, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, after again drawing his sleeve\\r\\nover his eyes and forehead, as the click came in his throat which I well\\r\\nremembered,--and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much\\r\\nin earnest; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou can't do better nor keep quiet, dear boy. You ain't\\r\\nlooked slowly forward to this as I have; you wosn't prepared for this as\\r\\nI wos. But didn't you never think it might be me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO no, no, no,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I returned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNever, never!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, you see it wos me, and single-handed. Never a soul in it but my\\r\\nown self and Mr. Jaggers.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWas there no one else?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, with a glance of surprise: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwho else should there be?\\r\\nAnd, dear boy, how good looking you have growed! There's bright eyes\\r\\nsomewheres--eh? Isn't there bright eyes somewheres, wot you love the\\r\\nthoughts on?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nO Estella, Estella!\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey shall be yourn, dear boy, if money can buy 'em. Not that a\\r\\ngentleman like you, so well set up as you, can't win 'em off of his own\\r\\ngame; but money shall back you! Let me finish wot I was a telling you,\\r\\ndear boy. From that there hut and that there hiring-out, I got money\\r\\nleft me by my master (which died, and had been the same as me), and got\\r\\nmy liberty and went for myself. In every single thing I went for, I went\\r\\nfor you. 'Lord strike a blight upon it,' I says, wotever it was I went\\r\\nfor, 'if it ain't for him!' It all prospered wonderful. As I giv' you\\r\\nto understand just now, I'm famous for it. It was the money left me, and\\r\\nthe gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr. Jaggers--all for\\r\\nyou--when he first come arter you, agreeable to my letter.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nO that he had never come! That he had left me at the forge,--far from\\r\\ncontented, yet, by comparison happy!\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, look'ee here, to know in\\r\\nsecret that I was making a gentleman. The blood horses of them colonists\\r\\nmight fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I say? I says\\r\\nto myself, 'I'm making a better gentleman nor ever you'll be!' When\\r\\none of 'em says to another, 'He was a convict, a few year ago, and is a\\r\\nignorant common fellow now, for all he's lucky,' what do I say? I says\\r\\nto myself, 'If I ain't a gentleman, nor yet ain't got no learning, I'm\\r\\nthe owner of such. All on you owns stock and land; which on you owns a\\r\\nbrought-up London gentleman?' This way I kep myself a going. And this\\r\\nway I held steady afore my mind that I would for certain come one day\\r\\nand see my boy, and make myself known to him, on his own ground.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe laid his hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that for\\r\\nanything I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt warn't easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warn't\\r\\nsafe. But I held to it, and the harder it was, the stronger I held, for\\r\\nI was determined, and my mind firm made up. At last I done it. Dear boy,\\r\\nI done it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned. Throughout, I had\\r\\nseemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him;\\r\\neven now, I could not separate his voice from those voices, though those\\r\\nwere loud and his was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhere will you put me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked, presently. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI must be put somewheres,\\r\\ndear boy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTo sleep?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. And to sleep long and sound,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he answered; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor I've been\\r\\nsea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy friend and companion,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, rising from the sofa, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis absent; you\\r\\nmust have his room.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe won't come back to-morrow; will he?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost\\r\\nefforts; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnot to-morrow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause, look'ee here, dear boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, dropping his voice, and\\r\\nlaying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccaution is\\r\\nnecessary.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow do you mean? Caution?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBy G----, it's Death!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat's death?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI was sent for life. It's death to come back. There's been overmuch\\r\\ncoming back of late years, and I should of a certainty be hanged if\\r\\ntook.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing was needed but this; the wretched man, after loading wretched me\\r\\nwith his gold and silver chains for years, had risked his life to come\\r\\nto me, and I held it there in my keeping! If I had loved him instead\\r\\nof abhorring him; if I had been attracted to him by the strongest\\r\\nadmiration and affection, instead of shrinking from him with the\\r\\nstrongest repugnance; it could have been no worse. On the contrary, it\\r\\nwould have been better, for his preservation would then have naturally\\r\\nand tenderly addressed my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be seen\\r\\nfrom without, and then to close and make fast the doors. While I did so,\\r\\nhe stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and when I saw\\r\\nhim thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again. It\\r\\nalmost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently, to file at his\\r\\nleg.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had gone into Herbert's room, and had shut off any other\\r\\ncommunication between it and the staircase than through the room in\\r\\nwhich our conversation had been held, I asked him if he would go to bed?\\r\\nHe said yes, but asked me for some of my Ã¢\\x80\\x9cgentleman's linenÃ¢\\x80\\x9d to put\\r\\non in the morning. I brought it out, and laid it ready for him, and my\\r\\nblood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me good\\r\\nnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got away from him, without knowing how I did it, and mended the fire\\r\\nin the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid to go\\r\\nto bed. For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to think; and it\\r\\nwas not until I began to think, that I began fully to know how wrecked I\\r\\nwas, and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Havisham's intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Estella not\\r\\ndesigned for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, a\\r\\nsting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to\\r\\npractise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the first\\r\\nsmarts I had. But, sharpest and deepest pain of all,--it was for the\\r\\nconvict, guilty of I knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken out\\r\\nof those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Bailey door,\\r\\nthat I had deserted Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back to\\r\\nBiddy now, for any consideration; simply, I suppose, because my sense of\\r\\nmy own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration.\\r\\nNo wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have\\r\\nderived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I could never, never,\\r\\nundo what I had done.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers. Twice, I could\\r\\nhave sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door. With\\r\\nthese fears upon me, I began either to imagine or recall that I had had\\r\\nmysterious warnings of this man's approach. That, for weeks gone by, I\\r\\nhad passed faces in the streets which I had thought like his. That these\\r\\nlikenesses had grown more numerous, as he, coming over the sea, had\\r\\ndrawn nearer. That his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers\\r\\nto mine, and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word,\\r\\nand with me.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen\\r\\nhim with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man; that I had\\r\\nheard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him; that\\r\\nI had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild\\r\\nbeast. Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire a\\r\\nhalf-formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with\\r\\nhim in the dead of the wild solitary night. This dilated until it filled\\r\\nthe room, and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my\\r\\ndreadful burden.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had rolled a handkerchief round his head, and his face was set and\\r\\nlowering in his sleep. But he was asleep, and quietly too, though he had\\r\\na pistol lying on the pillow. Assured of this, I softly removed the key\\r\\nto the outside of his door, and turned it on him before I again sat down\\r\\nby the fire. Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the floor.\\r\\nWhen I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of\\r\\nmy wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches were striking five,\\r\\nthe candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and the wind and rain\\r\\nintensified the thick black darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIP'S EXPECTATIONS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XL\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure (so far\\r\\nas I could) the safety of my dreaded visitor; for, this thought pressing\\r\\non me when I awoke, held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a\\r\\ndistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was\\r\\nself-evident. It could not be done, and the attempt to do it would\\r\\ninevitably engender suspicion. True, I had no Avenger in my service now,\\r\\nbut I was looked after by an inflammatory old female, assisted by an\\r\\nanimated rag-bag whom she called her niece, and to keep a room secret\\r\\nfrom them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration. They both had\\r\\nweak eyes, which I had long attributed to their chronically looking in\\r\\nat keyholes, and they were always at hand when not wanted; indeed that\\r\\nwas their only reliable quality besides larceny. Not to get up a mystery\\r\\nwith these people, I resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle\\r\\nhad unexpectedly come from the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness\\r\\nfor the means of getting a light. Not stumbling on the means after all,\\r\\nI was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to\\r\\ncome with his lantern. Now, in groping my way down the black staircase I\\r\\nfell over something, and that something was a man crouching in a corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there, but eluded\\r\\nmy touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman to come\\r\\nquickly; telling him of the incident on the way back. The wind being as\\r\\nfierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by\\r\\nrekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but we examined the\\r\\nstaircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there. It then\\r\\noccurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my\\r\\nrooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchman's, and leaving him\\r\\nstanding at the door, I examined them carefully, including the room in\\r\\nwhich my dreaded guest lay asleep. All was quiet, and assuredly no other\\r\\nman was in those chambers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on\\r\\nthat night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on the\\r\\nchance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram\\r\\nat the door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had\\r\\nperceptibly been dining out? Yes, he said; at different times of the\\r\\nnight, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in\\r\\nthe Lane, and he had seen them all go home. Again, the only other man\\r\\nwho dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in\\r\\nthe country for some weeks, and he certainly had not returned in the\\r\\nnight, because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came\\r\\nupstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe night being so bad, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the watchman, as he gave me back\\r\\nmy glass, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cuncommon few have come in at my gate. Besides them three\\r\\ngentlemen that I have named, I don't call to mind another since about\\r\\neleven o'clock, when a stranger asked for you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy uncle,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I muttered. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou saw him, sir?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. Oh yes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLikewise the person with him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerson with him!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI judged the person to be with him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the watchman. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe person\\r\\nstopped, when he stopped to make inquiry of me, and the person took this\\r\\nway when he took this way.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of person?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe watchman had not particularly noticed; he should say a working\\r\\nperson; to the best of his belief, he had a dust-colored kind of clothes\\r\\non, under a dark coat. The watchman made more light of the matter than I\\r\\ndid, and naturally; not having my reason for attaching weight to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had got rid of him, which I thought it well to do without\\r\\nprolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two\\r\\ncircumstances taken together. Whereas they were easy of innocent\\r\\nsolution apart,--as, for instance, some diner out or diner at home,\\r\\nwho had not gone near this watchman's gate, might have strayed to my\\r\\nstaircase and dropped asleep there,--and my nameless visitor might have\\r\\nbrought some one with him to show him the way,--still, joined, they had\\r\\nan ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a\\r\\nfew hours had made me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the\\r\\nmorning, and fell into a doze before it. I seemed to have been dozing a\\r\\nwhole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full an hour and\\r\\na half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up uneasily,\\r\\nwith prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now, making thunder\\r\\nof the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into a profound sleep\\r\\nfrom which the daylight woke me with a start.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor\\r\\ncould I do so yet. I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatly\\r\\ndejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way.\\r\\nAs to forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an\\r\\nelephant. When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild\\r\\nmorning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room; when I\\r\\nsat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress to\\r\\nappear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long\\r\\nI had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or even\\r\\nwho I was that made it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, the old woman and the niece came in,--the latter with a head\\r\\nnot easily distinguishable from her dusty broom,--and testified surprise\\r\\nat sight of me and the fire. To whom I imparted how my uncle had come in\\r\\nthe night and was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparations were\\r\\nto be modified accordingly. Then I washed and dressed while they knocked\\r\\nthe furniture about and made a dust; and so, in a sort of dream\\r\\nor sleep-waking, I found myself sitting by the fire again, waiting\\r\\nfor--Him--to come to breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by, his door opened and he came out. I could not bring myself to\\r\\nbear the sight of him, and I thought he had a worse look by daylight.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI do not even know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, speaking low as he took his seat at the\\r\\ntable, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cby what name to call you. I have given out that you are my\\r\\nuncle.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's it, dear boy! Call me uncle.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou assumed some name, I suppose, on board ship?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, dear boy. I took the name of Provis.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you mean to keep that name?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, yes, dear boy, it's as good as another,--unless you'd like\\r\\nanother.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is your real name?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked him in a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMagwitch,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he answered, in the same tone; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cchrisen'd Abel.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat were you brought up to be?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA warmint, dear boy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted some\\r\\nprofession.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen you came into the Temple last night--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, pausing to wonder\\r\\nwhether that could really have been last night, which seemed so long\\r\\nago.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, dear boy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had\\r\\nyou any one with you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWith me? No, dear boy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut there was some one there?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI didn't take particular notice,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, dubiously, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnot knowing the\\r\\nways of the place. But I think there was a person, too, come in alonger\\r\\nme.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you known in London?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI hope not!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that\\r\\nmade me turn hot and sick.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWere you known in London, once?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot over and above, dear boy. I was in the provinces mostly.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWere you--tried--in London?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich time?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, with a sharp look.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe last time.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFirst knowed Mr. Jaggers that way. Jaggers was for me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for, but he took up\\r\\na knife, gave it a flourish, and with the words, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd what I done is\\r\\nworked out and paid for!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d fell to at his breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all his actions\\r\\nwere uncouth, noisy, and greedy. Some of his teeth had failed him since\\r\\nI saw him eat on the marshes, and as he turned his food in his mouth,\\r\\nand turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon\\r\\nit, he looked terribly like a hungry old dog. If I had begun with any\\r\\nappetite, he would have taken it away, and I should have sat much as\\r\\nI did,--repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion, and gloomily\\r\\nlooking at the cloth.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI'm a heavy grubber, dear boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, as a polite kind of apology\\r\\nwhen he made an end of his meal, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I always was. If it had been in\\r\\nmy constitution to be a lighter grubber, I might ha' got into lighter\\r\\ntrouble. Similarly, I must have my smoke. When I was first hired out as\\r\\nshepherd t'other side the world, it's my belief I should ha' turned into\\r\\na molloncolly-mad sheep myself, if I hadn't a had my smoke.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he said so, he got up from table, and putting his hand into the\\r\\nbreast of the pea-coat he wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a\\r\\nhandful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head. Having\\r\\nfilled his pipe, he put the surplus tobacco back again, as if his pocket\\r\\nwere a drawer. Then, he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs,\\r\\nand lighted his pipe at it, and then turned round on the hearth-rug with\\r\\nhis back to the fire, and went through his favorite action of holding\\r\\nout both his hands for mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd this,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, dandling my hands up and down in his, as he puffed\\r\\nat his pipe,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand this is the gentleman what I made! The real genuine\\r\\nOne! It does me good fur to look at you, Pip. All I stip'late, is, to\\r\\nstand by and look at you, dear boy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning\\r\\nslowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition. What I was\\r\\nchained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard his\\r\\nhoarse voice, and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron\\r\\ngray hair at the sides.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI mustn't see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets;\\r\\nthere mustn't be no mud on his boots. My gentleman must have horses,\\r\\nPip! Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his servant\\r\\nto ride and drive as well. Shall colonists have their horses (and blood\\r\\n'uns, if you please, good Lord!) and not my London gentleman? No, no.\\r\\nWe'll show 'em another pair of shoes than that, Pip; won't us?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took out of his pocket a great thick pocket-book, bursting with\\r\\npapers, and tossed it on the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere's something worth spending in that there book, dear boy. It's\\r\\nyourn. All I've got ain't mine; it's yourn. Don't you be afeerd on it.\\r\\nThere's more where that come from. I've come to the old country fur\\r\\nto see my gentleman spend his money like a gentleman. That'll be my\\r\\npleasure. My pleasure 'ull be fur to see him do it. And blast you all!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n he wound up, looking round the room and snapping his fingers once with\\r\\na loud snap, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cblast you every one, from the judge in his wig, to the\\r\\ncolonist a stirring up the dust, I'll show a better gentleman than the\\r\\nwhole kit on you put together!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cStop!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI want to speak\\r\\nto you. I want to know what is to be done. I want to know how you are to\\r\\nbe kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what projects you\\r\\nhave.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLook'ee here, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly\\r\\naltered and subdued manner; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfirst of all, look'ee here. I forgot myself\\r\\nhalf a minute ago. What I said was low; that's what it was; low. Look'ee\\r\\nhere, Pip. Look over it. I ain't a going to be low.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFirst,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I resumed, half groaning, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat precautions can be taken\\r\\nagainst your being recognized and seized?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, dear boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, in the same tone as before, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat don't\\r\\ngo first. Lowness goes first. I ain't took so many year to make a\\r\\ngentleman, not without knowing what's due to him. Look'ee here, Pip. I\\r\\nwas low; that's what I was; low. Look over it, dear boy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSome sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I\\r\\nreplied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have looked over it. In Heaven's name, don't harp upon it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, but look'ee here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he persisted. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDear boy, I ain't come so fur,\\r\\nnot fur to be low. Now, go on, dear boy. You was a saying--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, dear boy, the danger ain't so great. Without I was informed\\r\\nagen, the danger ain't so much to signify. There's Jaggers, and there's\\r\\nWemmick, and there's you. Who else is there to inform?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs there no chance person who might identify you in the street?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nI.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthere ain't many. Nor yet I don't intend to\\r\\nadvertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from\\r\\nBotany Bay; and years have rolled away, and who's to gain by it? Still,\\r\\nlook'ee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, I should\\r\\nha' come to see you, mind you, just the same.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd how long do you remain?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow long?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, taking his black pipe from his mouth, and dropping\\r\\nhis jaw as he stared at me. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'm not a going back. I've come for good.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhere are you to live?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is to be done with you? Where\\r\\nwill you be safe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthere's disguising wigs can be bought\\r\\nfor money, and there's hair powder, and spectacles, and black\\r\\nclothes,--shorts and what not. Others has done it safe afore, and what\\r\\nothers has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how of\\r\\nliving, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou take it smoothly now,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut you were very serious last\\r\\nnight, when you swore it was Death.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd so I swear it is Death,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, putting his pipe back in his\\r\\nmouth, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this, and\\r\\nit's serious that you should fully understand it to be so. What then,\\r\\nwhen that's once done? Here I am. To go back now 'ud be as bad as to\\r\\nstand ground--worse. Besides, Pip, I'm here, because I've meant it by\\r\\nyou, years and years. As to what I dare, I'm a old bird now, as has\\r\\ndared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and I'm not afeerd\\r\\nto perch upon a scarecrow. If there's Death hid inside of it, there is,\\r\\nand let him come out, and I'll face him, and then I'll believe in him\\r\\nand not afore. And now let me have a look at my gentleman agen.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of\\r\\nadmiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some\\r\\nquiet lodging hard by, of which he might take possession when Herbert\\r\\nreturned: whom I expected in two or three days. That the secret must\\r\\nbe confided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I\\r\\ncould have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with\\r\\nhim out of the question, was plain to me. But it was by no means so\\r\\nplain to Mr. Provis (I resolved to call him by that name), who reserved\\r\\nhis consent to Herbert's participation until he should have seen him\\r\\nand formed a favorable judgment of his physiognomy. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd even then, dear\\r\\nboy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out of\\r\\nhis pocket, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe'll have him on his oath.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTo state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about\\r\\nthe world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to\\r\\nstate what I never quite established; but this I can say, that I never\\r\\nknew him put it to any other use. The book itself had the appearance of\\r\\nhaving been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his knowledge\\r\\nof its antecedents, combined with his own experience in that wise, gave\\r\\nhim a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm. On this\\r\\nfirst occasion of his producing it, I recalled how he had made me swear\\r\\nfidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he had described himself\\r\\nlast night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he\\r\\nlooked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next\\r\\ndiscussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished an\\r\\nextraordinary belief in the virtues of Ã¢\\x80\\x9cshortsÃ¢\\x80\\x9d as a disguise, and had\\r\\nin his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made\\r\\nhim something between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable\\r\\ndifficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a\\r\\nprosperous farmer's; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close,\\r\\nand wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by the\\r\\nlaundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view until\\r\\nhis change of dress was made.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my\\r\\ndazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not\\r\\nget out to further them until two or three in the afternoon. He was to\\r\\nremain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account\\r\\nto open the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in Essex Street,\\r\\nthe back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost within hail of\\r\\nmy windows, I first of all repaired to that house, and was so fortunate\\r\\nas to secure the second floor for my uncle, Mr. Provis. I then went from\\r\\nshop to shop, making such purchases as were necessary to the change in\\r\\nhis appearance. This business transacted, I turned my face, on my own\\r\\naccount, to Little Britain. Mr. Jaggers was at his desk, but, seeing me\\r\\nenter, got up immediately and stood before his fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbe careful.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI will, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I returned. For, coming along I had thought well of what\\r\\nI was going to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDon't commit yourself,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand don't commit any one.\\r\\nYou understand--any one. Don't tell me anything: I don't want to know\\r\\nanything; I am not curious.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course I saw that he knew the man was come.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI merely want, Mr. Jaggers,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto assure myself that what I have\\r\\nbeen told is true. I have no hope of its being untrue, but at least I\\r\\nmay verify it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Jaggers nodded. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut did you say 'told' or 'informed'?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked\\r\\nme, with his head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in\\r\\na listening way at the floor. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTold would seem to imply verbal\\r\\ncommunication. You can't have verbal communication with a man in New\\r\\nSouth Wales, you know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he is the\\r\\nbenefactor so long unknown to me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat is the man,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cin New South Wales.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd only he?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd only he,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible for\\r\\nmy mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was Miss\\r\\nHavisham.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs you say, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his eyes upon\\r\\nme coolly, and taking a bite at his forefinger, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am not at all\\r\\nresponsible for that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd yet it looked so like it, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I pleaded with a downcast heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot a particle of evidence, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his head\\r\\nand gathering up his skirts. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTake nothing on its looks; take everything\\r\\non evidence. There's no better rule.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have no more to say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for\\r\\na little while. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have verified my information, and there's an end.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd Magwitch--in New South Wales--having at last disclosed himself,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Mr. Jaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout\\r\\nmy communication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line of\\r\\nfact. There has never been the least departure from the strict line of\\r\\nfact. You are quite aware of that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cQuite, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI communicated to Magwitch--in New South Wales--when he first wrote to\\r\\nme--from New South Wales--the caution that he must not expect me ever to\\r\\ndeviate from the strict line of fact. I also communicated to him another\\r\\ncaution. He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at\\r\\nsome distant idea he had of seeing you in England here. I cautioned\\r\\nhim that I must hear no more of that; that he was not at all likely to\\r\\nobtain a pardon; that he was expatriated for the term of his natural\\r\\nlife; and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of\\r\\nfelony, rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law. I gave\\r\\nMagwitch that caution,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at me; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wrote\\r\\nit to New South Wales. He guided himself by it, no doubt.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo doubt,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have been informed by Wemmick,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking\\r\\nhard at me, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat he has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from\\r\\na colonist of the name of Purvis, or--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOr Provis,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOr Provis--thank you, Pip. Perhaps it is Provis? Perhaps you know it's\\r\\nProvis?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know it's Provis. A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist\\r\\nof the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on\\r\\nbehalf of Magwitch. Wemmick sent him the particulars, I understand, by\\r\\nreturn of post. Probably it is through Provis that you have received the\\r\\nexplanation of Magwitch--in New South Wales?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt came through Provis,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood day, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cglad to have\\r\\nseen you. In writing by post to Magwitch--in New South Wales--or in\\r\\ncommunicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to mention that\\r\\nthe particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you,\\r\\ntogether with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining. Good\\r\\nday, Pip!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me. I\\r\\nturned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two\\r\\nvile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open,\\r\\nand to force out of their swollen throats, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cO, what a man he is!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWemmick was out, and though he had been at his desk he could have done\\r\\nnothing for me. I went straight back to the Temple, where I found\\r\\nthe terrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro-head, in\\r\\nsafety.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and he put them on.\\r\\nWhatever he put on, became him less (it dismally seemed to me) than what\\r\\nhe had worn before. To my thinking, there was something in him that made\\r\\nit hopeless to attempt to disguise him. The more I dressed him and the\\r\\nbetter I dressed him, the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on\\r\\nthe marshes. This effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable, no\\r\\ndoubt, to his old face and manner growing more familiar to me; but I\\r\\nbelieve too that he dragged one of his legs as if there were still a\\r\\nweight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there was Convict in\\r\\nthe very grain of the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe influences of his solitary hut-life were upon him besides, and\\r\\ngave him a savage air that no dress could tame; added to these were the\\r\\ninfluences of his subsequent branded life among men, and, crowning all,\\r\\nhis consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now. In all his ways of\\r\\nsitting and standing, and eating and drinking,--of brooding about in a\\r\\nhigh-shouldered reluctant style,--of taking out his great horn-handled\\r\\njackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food,--of\\r\\nlifting light glasses and cups to his lips, as if they were clumsy\\r\\npannikins,--of chopping a wedge off his bread, and soaking up with it\\r\\nthe last fragments of gravy round and round his plate, as if to make the\\r\\nmost of an allowance, and then drying his finger-ends on it, and then\\r\\nswallowing it,--in these ways and a thousand other small nameless\\r\\ninstances arising every minute in the day, there was Prisoner, Felon,\\r\\nBondsman, plain as plain could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I had\\r\\nconceded the powder after overcoming the shorts. But I can compare the\\r\\neffect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon\\r\\nthe dead; so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it was\\r\\nmost desirable to repress, started through that thin layer of pretence,\\r\\nand seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head. It was\\r\\nabandoned as soon as tried, and he wore his grizzled hair cut short.\\r\\n\\r\\nWords cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadful\\r\\nmystery that he was to me. When he fell asleep of an evening, with his\\r\\nknotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and his bald head\\r\\ntattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast, I would sit\\r\\nand look at him, wondering what he had done, and loading him with all\\r\\nthe crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me to\\r\\nstart up and fly from him. Every hour so increased my abhorrence of\\r\\nhim, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the first\\r\\nagonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he had done for me and\\r\\nthe risk he ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon come back.\\r\\nOnce, I actually did start out of bed in the night, and begin to dress\\r\\nmyself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave him there with\\r\\neverything else I possessed, and enlist for India as a private soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\nI doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those\\r\\nlonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and the\\r\\nrain always rushing by. A ghost could not have been taken and hanged on\\r\\nmy account, and the consideration that he could be, and the dread that\\r\\nhe would be, were no small addition to my horrors. When he was not\\r\\nasleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a ragged pack of\\r\\ncards of his own,--a game that I never saw before or since, and in which\\r\\nhe recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the table,--when\\r\\nhe was not engaged in either of these pursuits, he would ask me to\\r\\nread to him,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cForeign language, dear boy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d While I complied, he, not\\r\\ncomprehending a single word, would stand before the fire surveying me\\r\\nwith the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him, between the fingers\\r\\nof the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb show to\\r\\nthe furniture to take notice of my proficiency. The imaginary student\\r\\npursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made, was not more\\r\\nwretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, and recoiling\\r\\nfrom him with a stronger repulsion, the more he admired me and the\\r\\nfonder he was of me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year. It lasted\\r\\nabout five days. Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not go out,\\r\\nexcept when I took Provis for an airing after dark. At length, one\\r\\nevening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite\\r\\nworn out,--for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful\\r\\ndreams,--I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase. Provis,\\r\\nwho had been asleep too, staggered up at the noise I made, and in an\\r\\ninstant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cQuiet! It's Herbert!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I said; and Herbert came bursting in, with the\\r\\nairy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHandel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and again\\r\\nhow are you? I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth! Why, so I must have\\r\\nbeen, for you have grown quite thin and pale! Handel, my--Halloa! I beg\\r\\nyour pardon.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me, by\\r\\nseeing Provis. Provis, regarding him with a fixed attention, was slowly\\r\\nputting up his jackknife, and groping in another pocket for something\\r\\nelse.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHerbert, my dear friend,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, shutting the double doors, while\\r\\nHerbert stood staring and wondering, Ã¢\\x80\\x9csomething very strange has\\r\\nhappened. This is--a visitor of mine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's all right, dear boy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Provis coming forward, with his little\\r\\nclasped black book, and then addressing himself to Herbert. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTake it in\\r\\nyour right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in\\r\\nany way sumever! Kiss it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo so, as he wishes it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I said to Herbert. So, Herbert, looking at\\r\\nme with a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis\\r\\nimmediately shaking hands with him, said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow you're on your oath, you\\r\\nknow. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan't make a gentleman on\\r\\nyou!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLI\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet\\r\\nof Herbert, when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I\\r\\nrecounted the whole of the secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelings\\r\\nreflected in Herbert's face, and not least among them, my repugnance\\r\\ntowards the man who had done so much for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there\\r\\nhad been no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in my story.\\r\\nSaving his troublesome sense of having been Ã¢\\x80\\x9clowÃ¢\\x80\\x9d on one occasion since\\r\\nhis return,--on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert, the\\r\\nmoment my revelation was finished,--he had no perception of the\\r\\npossibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune. His boast that\\r\\nhe had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to see me support the\\r\\ncharacter on his ample resources, was made for me quite as much as for\\r\\nhimself. And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us,\\r\\nand that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quite\\r\\nestablished in his own mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThough, look'ee here, Pip's comrade,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said to Herbert, after having\\r\\ndiscoursed for some time, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI know very well that once since I come\\r\\nback--for half a minute--I've been low. I said to Pip, I knowed as I had\\r\\nbeen low. But don't you fret yourself on that score. I ain't made Pip a\\r\\ngentleman, and Pip ain't a going to make you a gentleman, not fur me not\\r\\nto know what's due to ye both. Dear boy, and Pip's comrade, you two may\\r\\ncount upon me always having a gen-teel muzzle on. Muzzled I have been\\r\\nsince that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness, muzzled I am\\r\\nat the present time, muzzled I ever will be.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCertainly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but looked as if there were no specific\\r\\nconsolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed. We were\\r\\nanxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us\\r\\ntogether, but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and sat\\r\\nlate. It was midnight before I took him round to Essex Street, and\\r\\nsaw him safely in at his own dark door. When it closed upon him, I\\r\\nexperienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of\\r\\nhis arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs,\\r\\nI had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark, and in\\r\\nbringing him back; and I looked about me now. Difficult as it is in a\\r\\nlarge city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is\\r\\nconscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself that any\\r\\nof the people within sight cared about my movements. The few who were\\r\\npassing passed on their several ways, and the street was empty when I\\r\\nturned back into the Temple. Nobody had come out at the gate with us,\\r\\nnobody went in at the gate with me. As I crossed by the fountain, I saw\\r\\nhis lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and, when I stood for\\r\\na few moments in the doorway of the building where I lived, before going\\r\\nup the stairs, Garden Court was as still and lifeless as the staircase\\r\\nwas when I ascended it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so\\r\\nblessedly what it is to have a friend. When he had spoken some sound\\r\\nwords of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the\\r\\nquestion, What was to be done?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had\\r\\nstood,--for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot, in\\r\\none unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with\\r\\nhis pipe and his negro-head and his jackknife and his pack of cards,\\r\\nand what not, as if it were all put down for him on a slate,--I say his\\r\\nchair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, but\\r\\nnext moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another. He had\\r\\nno occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my\\r\\npatron, neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged that\\r\\nconfidence without shaping a syllable.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat is\\r\\nto be done?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy poor dear Handel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied, holding his head, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am too stunned\\r\\nto think.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell. Still, something must be\\r\\ndone. He is intent upon various new expenses,--horses, and carriages,\\r\\nand lavish appearances of all kinds. He must be stopped somehow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou mean that you can't accept--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow can I?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I interposed, as Herbert paused. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThink of him! Look at\\r\\nhim!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAn involuntary shudder passed over both of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached to\\r\\nme, strongly attached to me. Was there ever such a fate!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy poor dear Handel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Herbert repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cafter all, stopping short here, never taking another\\r\\npenny from him, think what I owe him already! Then again: I am heavily\\r\\nin debt,--very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,--and I have\\r\\nbeen bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, well, well!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Herbert remonstrated. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDon't say fit for nothing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that\\r\\nis, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but for\\r\\nthe prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a\\r\\nwarm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnyhow, my dear Handel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he presently, Ã¢\\x80\\x9csoldiering won't do. If\\r\\nyou were to renounce this patronage and these favors, I suppose you\\r\\nwould do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have\\r\\nalready had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!\\r\\nBesides, it's absurd. You would be infinitely better in Clarriker's\\r\\nhouse, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor fellow! He little suspected with whose money.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut there is another question,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThis is an ignorant,\\r\\ndetermined man, who has long had one fixed idea. More than that, he\\r\\nseems to me (I may misjudge him) to be a man of a desperate and fierce\\r\\ncharacter.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI know he is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I returned. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet me tell you what evidence I have seen\\r\\nof it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative, of that\\r\\nencounter with the other convict.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSee, then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthink of this! He comes here at the peril\\r\\nof his life, for the realization of his fixed idea. In the moment of\\r\\nrealization, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground from\\r\\nunder his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him.\\r\\nDo you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night\\r\\nof his arrival. Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his\\r\\nputting himself in the way of being taken.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen you may rely upon it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat there would be great\\r\\ndanger of his doing it. That is his power over you as long as he remains\\r\\nin England, and that would be his reckless course if you forsook him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon\\r\\nme from the first, and the working out of which would make me regard\\r\\nmyself, in some sort, as his murderer, that I could not rest in my\\r\\nchair, but began pacing to and fro. I said to Herbert, meanwhile, that\\r\\neven if Provis were recognized and taken, in spite of himself, I should\\r\\nbe wretched as the cause, however innocently. Yes; even though I was so\\r\\nwretched in having him at large and near me, and even though I would\\r\\nfar rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I would\\r\\never have come to this!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe first and the main thing to be done,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis to get him\\r\\nout of England. You will have to go with him, and then he may be induced\\r\\nto go.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut get him where I will, could I prevent his coming back?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next street,\\r\\nthere must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him and\\r\\nmaking him reckless, here, than elsewhere? If a pretext to get him away\\r\\ncould be made out of that other convict, or out of anything else in his\\r\\nlife, now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere, again!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open hands held\\r\\nout, as if they contained the desperation of the case. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI know nothing\\r\\nof his life. It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see\\r\\nhim before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes, and yet so\\r\\nunknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days\\r\\nin my childhood!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert got up, and linked his arm in mine, and we slowly walked to and\\r\\nfro together, studying the carpet.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHandel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, stopping, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou feel convinced that you can take\\r\\nno further benefits from him; do you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFully. Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd you feel convinced that you must break with him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHerbert, can you ask me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life he\\r\\nhas risked on your account, that you must save him, if possible, from\\r\\nthrowing it away. Then you must get him out of England before you stir a\\r\\nfinger to extricate yourself. That done, extricate yourself, in Heaven's\\r\\nname, and we'll see it out together, dear old boy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again,\\r\\nwith only that done.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Herbert,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwith reference to gaining some knowledge of\\r\\nhis history. There is but one way that I know of. I must ask him point\\r\\nblank.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. Ask him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhen we sit at breakfast in the morning.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n For he had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he would come to\\r\\nbreakfast with us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this project formed, we went to bed. I had the wildest dreams\\r\\nconcerning him, and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fear\\r\\nwhich I had lost in the night, of his being found out as a returned\\r\\ntransport. Waking, I never lost that fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came round at the appointed time, took out his jackknife, and sat\\r\\ndown to his meal. He was full of plans Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor his gentleman's coming out\\r\\nstrong, and like a gentleman,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and urged me to begin speedily upon\\r\\nthe pocket-book which he had left in my possession. He considered the\\r\\nchambers and his own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me to\\r\\nlook out at once for a Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfashionable cribÃ¢\\x80\\x9d near Hyde Park, in which he\\r\\ncould have Ã¢\\x80\\x9ca shake-down.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d When he had made an end of his breakfast,\\r\\nand was wiping his knife on his leg, I said to him, without a word of\\r\\npreface,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAfter you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle that\\r\\nthe soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up. You\\r\\nremember?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRemember!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think so!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe want to know something about that man--and about you. It is strange\\r\\nto know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able to\\r\\ntell last night. Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing\\r\\nmore?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, after consideration. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou're on your oath, you know,\\r\\nPip's comrade?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAssuredly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied Herbert.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs to anything I say, you know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he insisted. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe oath applies to\\r\\nall.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI understand it to do so.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd look'ee here! Wotever I done is worked out and paid for,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ninsisted again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo be it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro-head,\\r\\nwhen, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand, he seemed to think\\r\\nit might perplex the thread of his narrative. He put it back again,\\r\\nstuck his pipe in a button-hole of his coat, spread a hand on each knee,\\r\\nand after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments,\\r\\nlooked round at us and said what follows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLII\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear boy and Pip's comrade. I am not a going fur to tell you my life\\r\\nlike a song, or a story-book. But to give it you short and handy, I'll\\r\\nput it at once into a mouthful of English. In jail and out of jail, in\\r\\njail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail. There, you've got it.\\r\\nThat's my life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off,\\r\\narter Pip stood my friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI've been done everything to, pretty well--except hanged. I've been\\r\\nlocked up as much as a silver tea-kittle. I've been carted here and\\r\\ncarted there, and put out of this town, and put out of that town, and\\r\\nstuck in the stocks, and whipped and worried and drove. I've no more\\r\\nnotion where I was born than you have--if so much. I first become aware\\r\\nof myself down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my living. Summun had\\r\\nrun away from me--a man--a tinker--and he'd took the fire with him, and\\r\\nleft me wery cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI know'd my name to be Magwitch, chrisen'd Abel. How did I know\\r\\nit? Much as I know'd the birds' names in the hedges to be chaffinch,\\r\\nsparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies together, only as\\r\\nthe birds' names come out true, I supposed mine did.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo fur as I could find, there warn't a soul that see young Abel\\r\\nMagwitch, with us little on him as in him, but wot caught fright at him,\\r\\nand either drove him off, or took him up. I was took up, took up, took\\r\\nup, to that extent that I reg'larly grow'd up took up.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as much\\r\\nto be pitied as ever I see (not that I looked in the glass, for there\\r\\nwarn't many insides of furnished houses known to me), I got the name of\\r\\nbeing hardened. 'This is a terrible hardened one,' they says to prison\\r\\nwisitors, picking out me. 'May be said to live in jails, this boy.' Then\\r\\nthey looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured my head, some\\r\\non 'em,--they had better a measured my stomach,--and others on 'em giv\\r\\nme tracts what I couldn't read, and made me speeches what I couldn't\\r\\nunderstand. They always went on agen me about the Devil. But what\\r\\nthe Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach, mustn't\\r\\nI?--Howsomever, I'm a getting low, and I know what's due. Dear boy and\\r\\nPip's comrade, don't you be afeerd of me being low.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could,--though\\r\\nthat warn't as often as you may think, till you put the question whether\\r\\nyou would ha' been over-ready to give me work yourselves,--a bit of a\\r\\npoacher, a bit of a laborer, a bit of a wagoner, a bit of a haymaker,\\r\\na bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that don't pay and lead to\\r\\ntrouble, I got to be a man. A deserting soldier in a Traveller's Rest,\\r\\nwhat lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs, learnt me to read;\\r\\nand a travelling Giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me\\r\\nto write. I warn't locked up as often now as formerly, but I wore out my\\r\\ngood share of key-metal still.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted wi'\\r\\na man whose skull I'd crack wi' this poker, like the claw of a lobster,\\r\\nif I'd got it on this hob. His right name was Compeyson; and that's the\\r\\nman, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch, according to\\r\\nwhat you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last night.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he'd been to a public\\r\\nboarding-school and had learning. He was a smooth one to talk, and was\\r\\na dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He was good-looking too. It was the\\r\\nnight afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booth\\r\\nthat I know'd on. Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when\\r\\nI went in, and the landlord (which had a knowledge of me, and was a\\r\\nsporting one) called him out, and said, 'I think this is a man that\\r\\nmight suit you,'--meaning I was.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCompeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He has a\\r\\nwatch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of\\r\\nclothes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c'To judge from appearances, you're out of luck,' says Compeyson to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c'Yes, master, and I've never been in it much.' (I had come out of\\r\\nKingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have\\r\\nbeen for something else; but it warn't.)\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c'Luck changes,' says Compeyson; 'perhaps yours is going to change.'\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI says, 'I hope it may be so. There's room.'\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c'What can you do?' says Compeyson.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c'Eat and drink,' I says; 'if you'll find the materials.'\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCompeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five\\r\\nshillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on\\r\\nto be his man and pardner. And what was Compeyson's business in which we\\r\\nwas to go pardners? Compeyson's business was the swindling, handwriting\\r\\nforging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like. All sorts of traps as\\r\\nCompeyson could set with his head, and keep his own legs out of and get\\r\\nthe profits from and let another man in for, was Compeyson's business.\\r\\nHe'd no more heart than a iron file, he was as cold as death, and he had\\r\\nthe head of the Devil afore mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,--not as\\r\\nbeing so chrisen'd, but as a surname. He was in a Decline, and was a\\r\\nshadow to look at. Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a\\r\\nrich lady some years afore, and they'd made a pot of money by it; but\\r\\nCompeyson betted and gamed, and he'd have run through the king's taxes.\\r\\nSo, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him,\\r\\nand Compeyson's wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pity\\r\\non him when she could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and\\r\\nnobody.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn't; and I won't pretend I\\r\\nwas partick'ler--for where 'ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?\\r\\nSo I begun wi' Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands. Arthur\\r\\nlived at the top of Compeyson's house (over nigh Brentford it was), and\\r\\nCompeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging, in case\\r\\nhe should ever get better to work it out. But Arthur soon settled the\\r\\naccount. The second or third time as ever I see him, he come a tearing\\r\\ndown into Compeyson's parlor late at night, in only a flannel gown, with\\r\\nhis hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeyson's wife, 'Sally, she\\r\\nreally is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can't get rid of her. She's\\r\\nall in white,' he says, 'wi' white flowers in her hair, and she's awful\\r\\nmad, and she's got a shroud hanging over her arm, and she says she'll\\r\\nput it on me at five in the morning.'\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSays Compeyson: 'Why, you fool, don't you know she's got a living body?\\r\\nAnd how should she be up there, without coming through the door, or in\\r\\nat the window, and up the stairs?'\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c'I don't know how she's there,' says Arthur, shivering dreadful with\\r\\nthe horrors, 'but she's standing in the corner at the foot of the bed,\\r\\nawful mad. And over where her heart's broke--you broke it!--there's\\r\\ndrops of blood.'\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCompeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward. 'Go up alonger this\\r\\ndrivelling sick man,' he says to his wife, 'and Magwitch, lend her a\\r\\nhand, will you?' But he never come nigh himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCompeyson's wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved most\\r\\ndreadful. 'Why look at her!' he cries out. 'She's a shaking the shroud\\r\\nat me! Don't you see her? Look at her eyes! Ain't it awful to see her so\\r\\nmad?' Next he cries, 'She'll put it on me, and then I'm done for! Take\\r\\nit away from her, take it away!' And then he catched hold of us, and kep\\r\\non a talking to her, and answering of her, till I half believed I see\\r\\nher myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCompeyson's wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get the\\r\\nhorrors off, and by and by he quieted. 'O, she's gone! Has her keeper\\r\\nbeen for her?' he says. 'Yes,' says Compeyson's wife. 'Did you tell him\\r\\nto lock her and bar her in?' 'Yes.' 'And to take that ugly thing away\\r\\nfrom her?' 'Yes, yes, all right.' 'You're a good creetur,' he says,\\r\\n'don't leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!'\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and\\r\\nthen he starts up with a scream, and screams out, 'Here she is! She's\\r\\ngot the shroud again. She's unfolding it. She's coming out of the\\r\\ncorner. She's coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you--one of each\\r\\nside--don't let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that time.\\r\\nDon't let her throw it over my shoulders. Don't let her lift me up to\\r\\nget it round me. She's lifting me up. Keep me down!' Then he lifted\\r\\nhimself up hard, and was dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCompeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him and\\r\\nme was soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my own\\r\\nbook,--this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade\\r\\non.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done--which 'ud\\r\\ntake a week--I'll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip's comrade, that\\r\\nthat man got me into such nets as made me his black slave. I was always\\r\\nin debt to him, always under his thumb, always a working, always a\\r\\ngetting into danger. He was younger than me, but he'd got craft, and\\r\\nhe'd got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and\\r\\nno mercy. My Missis as I had the hard time wi'--Stop though! I ain't\\r\\nbrought her in--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked about him in a confused way, as if he had lost his place in\\r\\nthe book of his remembrance; and he turned his face to the fire, and\\r\\nspread his hands broader on his knees, and lifted them off and put them\\r\\non again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere ain't no need to go into it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, looking round once more.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe time wi' Compeyson was a'most as hard a time as ever I had; that\\r\\nsaid, all's said. Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for misdemeanor,\\r\\nwhile with Compeyson?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI answered, No.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI was, and got convicted. As to took up on suspicion,\\r\\nthat was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted;\\r\\nbut evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was both committed\\r\\nfor felony,--on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation,--and\\r\\nthere was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me, 'Separate\\r\\ndefences, no communication,' and that was all. And I was so miserable\\r\\npoor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on my back,\\r\\nafore I could get Jaggers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman\\r\\nCompeyson looked, wi' his curly hair and his black clothes and his white\\r\\npocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked. When\\r\\nthe prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand, I\\r\\nnoticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him. When the\\r\\nevidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had\\r\\ncome for'ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the money\\r\\nhad been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing\\r\\nand get the profit. But when the defence come on, then I see the plan\\r\\nplainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, 'My lord and gentlemen,\\r\\nhere you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your eyes can\\r\\nseparate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be spoke to\\r\\nas such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to as such;\\r\\none, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here transactions, and\\r\\nonly suspected; t'other, the elder, always seen in 'em and always wi' his\\r\\nguilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is but one in it, which is\\r\\nthe one, and, if there is two in it, which is much the worst one?' And\\r\\nsuch-like. And when it come to character, warn't it Compeyson as had\\r\\nbeen to the school, and warn't it his schoolfellows as was in this\\r\\nposition and in that, and warn't it him as had been know'd by witnesses\\r\\nin such clubs and societies, and nowt to his disadvantage? And warn't it\\r\\nme as had been tried afore, and as had been know'd up hill and down dale\\r\\nin Bridewells and Lock-Ups! And when it come to speech-making, warn't it\\r\\nCompeyson as could speak to 'em wi' his face dropping every now and then\\r\\ninto his white pocket-handkercher,--ah! and wi' verses in his speech,\\r\\ntoo,--and warn't it me as could only say, 'Gentlemen, this man at my\\r\\nside is a most precious rascal'? And when the verdict come, warn't it\\r\\nCompeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and\\r\\nbad company, and giving up all the information he could agen me,\\r\\nand warn't it me as got never a word but Guilty? And when I says to\\r\\nCompeyson, 'Once out of this court, I'll smash that face of yourn!'\\r\\nain't it Compeyson as prays the Judge to be protected, and gets two\\r\\nturnkeys stood betwixt us? And when we're sentenced, ain't it him as\\r\\ngets seven year, and me fourteen, and ain't it him as the Judge is\\r\\nsorry for, because he might a done so well, and ain't it me as the Judge\\r\\nperceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion, likely to come to\\r\\nworse?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he checked\\r\\nit, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching\\r\\nout his hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI ain't a going\\r\\nto be low, dear boy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his\\r\\nface and head and neck and hands, before he could go on.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI had said to Compeyson that I'd smash that face of his, and I swore\\r\\nLord smash mine! to do it. We was in the same prison-ship, but I\\r\\ncouldn't get at him for long, though I tried. At last I come behind him\\r\\nand hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at\\r\\nhim, when I was seen and seized. The black-hole of that ship warn't\\r\\na strong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive. I\\r\\nescaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there, envying\\r\\nthem as was in 'em and all over, when I first see my boy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent\\r\\nto me again, though I had felt great pity for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBy my boy, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them marshes\\r\\ntoo. Upon my soul, I half believe he escaped in his terror, to get quit\\r\\nof me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore. I hunted him down. I\\r\\nsmashed his face. 'And now,' says I 'as the worst thing I can do, caring\\r\\nnothing for myself, I'll drag you back.' And I'd have swum off, towing\\r\\nhim by the hair, if it had come to that, and I'd a got him aboard\\r\\nwithout the soldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf course he'd much the best of it to the last,--his character was so\\r\\ngood. He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous\\r\\nintentions; and his punishment was light. I was put in irons, brought\\r\\nto trial again, and sent for life. I didn't stop for life, dear boy and\\r\\nPip's comrade, being here.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wiped himself again, as he had done before, and then slowly took\\r\\nhis tangle of tobacco from his pocket, and plucked his pipe from his\\r\\nbutton-hole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs he dead?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked, after a silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs who dead, dear boy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCompeyson.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe hopes I am, if he's alive, you may be sure,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d with a fierce look. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nnever heerd no more of him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book. He\\r\\nsoftly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with his eyes\\r\\non the fire, and I read in it:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYoung Havisham's name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed to\\r\\nbe Miss Havisham's lover.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book by; but\\r\\nwe neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as he stood\\r\\nsmoking by the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLIII\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be\\r\\ntraced to Estella? Why should I loiter on my road, to compare the state\\r\\nof mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison\\r\\nbefore meeting her at the coach-office, with the state of mind in which\\r\\nI now reflected on the abyss between Estella in her pride and beauty,\\r\\nand the returned transport whom I harbored? The road would be none the\\r\\nsmoother for it, the end would be none the better for it, he would not\\r\\nbe helped, nor I extenuated.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative; or rather,\\r\\nhis narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already\\r\\nthere. If Compeyson were alive and should discover his return, I could\\r\\nhardly doubt the consequence. That Compeyson stood in mortal fear of\\r\\nhim, neither of the two could know much better than I; and that any\\r\\nsuch man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release\\r\\nhimself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an\\r\\ninformer was scarcely to be imagined.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever had I breathed, and never would I breathe--or so I resolved--a\\r\\nword of Estella to Provis. But, I said to Herbert that, before I could\\r\\ngo abroad, I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham. This was when we\\r\\nwere left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his story. I\\r\\nresolved to go out to Richmond next day, and I went.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn my presenting myself at Mrs. Brandley's, Estella's maid was called to\\r\\ntell that Estella had gone into the country. Where? To Satis House, as\\r\\nusual. Not as usual, I said, for she had never yet gone there without\\r\\nme; when was she coming back? There was an air of reservation in the\\r\\nanswer which increased my perplexity, and the answer was, that her maid\\r\\nbelieved she was only coming back at all for a little while. I could\\r\\nmake nothing of this, except that it was meant that I should make\\r\\nnothing of it, and I went home again in complete discomfiture.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother night consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home (I\\r\\nalways took him home, and always looked well about me), led us to the\\r\\nconclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came\\r\\nback from Miss Havisham's. In the mean time, Herbert and I were to\\r\\nconsider separately what it would be best to say; whether we should\\r\\ndevise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious\\r\\nobservation; or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, should propose\\r\\nan expedition. We both knew that I had but to propose anything, and he\\r\\nwould consent. We agreed that his remaining many days in his present\\r\\nhazard was not to be thought of.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise\\r\\nto go down to Joe; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe\\r\\nor his name. Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone, and\\r\\nHerbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken. I was to be\\r\\nabsent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his\\r\\nimpatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to\\r\\nbe begun. It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to\\r\\nHerbert also, that he might be best got away across the water, on that\\r\\npretence,--as, to make purchases, or the like.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham's, I set\\r\\noff by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out\\r\\non the open country road when the day came creeping on, halting and\\r\\nwhimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of\\r\\nmist, like a beggar. When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly\\r\\nride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand,\\r\\nto look at the coach, but Bentley Drummle!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him. It was a very\\r\\nlame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went into the\\r\\ncoffee-room, where he had just finished his breakfast, and where I\\r\\nordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see him in the town, for I very\\r\\nwell knew why he had come there.\\r\\n\\r\\nPretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had\\r\\nnothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of\\r\\ncoffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which\\r\\nit was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly\\r\\nirregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire. By\\r\\ndegrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the\\r\\nfire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my\\r\\nhand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to\\r\\nstir the fire, but still pretended not to know him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs this a cut?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Drummle.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, poker in hand; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit's you, is it? How do you do? I was\\r\\nwondering who it was, who kept the fire off.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself side\\r\\nby side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou have just come down?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away\\r\\nwith his shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, edging him a little away with my shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBeastly place,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Drummle. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYour part of the country, I think?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I assented. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am told it's very like your Shropshire.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot in the least like it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Drummle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr.\\r\\nDrummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you been here long?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked, determined not to yield an inch of\\r\\nthe fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLong enough to be tired of it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Drummle, pretending to yawn,\\r\\nbut equally determined.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you stay here long?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCan't say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d answered Mr. Drummle. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCan't say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle's\\r\\nshoulder had claimed another hair's breadth of room, I should have\\r\\njerked him into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urged a\\r\\nsimilar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box. He\\r\\nwhistled a little. So did I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLarge tract of marshes about here, I believe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Drummle.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. What of that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and\\r\\nlaughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you amused, Mr. Drummle?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnot particularly. I am going out for a ride in the\\r\\nsaddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Out-of-the-way\\r\\nvillages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses--and\\r\\nsmithies--and that. Waiter!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs that horse of mine ready?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBrought round to the door, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI say. Look here, you sir. The lady won't ride to-day; the weather\\r\\nwon't do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery good, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd I don't dine, because I'm going to dine at the lady's.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery good, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his\\r\\ngreat-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and so\\r\\nexasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as the\\r\\nrobber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady) and seat\\r\\nhim on the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief\\r\\ncame, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, well\\r\\nsquared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our\\r\\nhands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible outside in\\r\\nthe drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle's\\r\\nwas cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both\\r\\nstood our ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you been to the Grove since?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Drummle.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was\\r\\nthere.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWas that when we had a difference of opinion?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I replied, very shortly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCome, come! They let you off easily enough,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d sneered Drummle. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\nshouldn't have lost your temper.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Drummle,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou are not competent to give advice on that\\r\\nsubject. When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so on that\\r\\noccasion), I don't throw glasses.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Drummle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state of\\r\\nsmouldering ferocity, I said,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don't think it an\\r\\nagreeable one.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am sure it's not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, superciliously over his shoulder; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\ndon't think anything about it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd therefore,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I went on, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwith your leave, I will suggest that we\\r\\nhold no kind of communication in future.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cQuite my opinion,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Drummle, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand what I should have suggested\\r\\nmyself, or done--more likely--without suggesting. But don't lose your\\r\\ntemper. Haven't you lost enough without that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean, sir?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWaiter!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Drummle, by way of answering me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe waiter reappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLook here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady don't ride\\r\\nto-day, and that I dine at the young lady's?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cQuite so, sir!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his\\r\\nhand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle,\\r\\ncareful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocket\\r\\nand bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring. Choking and\\r\\nboiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without\\r\\nintroducing Estella's name, which I could not endure to hear him utter;\\r\\nand therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were\\r\\nno one present, and forced myself to silence. How long we might have\\r\\nremained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but\\r\\nfor the incursion of three thriving farmers--laid on by the waiter, I\\r\\nthink--who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and\\r\\nrubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we\\r\\nwere obliged to give way.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw him through the window, seizing his horse's mane, and mounting in\\r\\nhis blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thought\\r\\nhe was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar in his\\r\\nmouth, which he had forgotten. A man in a dust-colored dress appeared\\r\\nwith what was wanted,--I could not have said from where: whether from\\r\\nthe inn yard, or the street, or where not,--and as Drummle leaned down\\r\\nfrom the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with a jerk of his\\r\\nhead towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching shoulders and ragged\\r\\nhair of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of Orlick.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or\\r\\nno, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the\\r\\njourney from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house\\r\\nthat it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered,\\r\\nnever to have seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLIV\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax-candles\\r\\nburnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss Havisham\\r\\nseated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her feet.\\r\\nEstella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on. They both raised\\r\\ntheir eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me. I derived\\r\\nthat, from the look they interchanged.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd what wind,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cblows you here, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThough she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.\\r\\nEstella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, and\\r\\nthen going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, as\\r\\nplainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceived I\\r\\nhad discovered my real benefactor.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss Havisham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to\\r\\nEstella; and finding that some wind had blown her here, I followed.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,\\r\\nI took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her\\r\\noccupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural\\r\\nplace for me, that day.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you,\\r\\npresently--in a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will not\\r\\ndisplease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in the\\r\\naction of Estella's fingers as they worked that she attended to what I\\r\\nsaid; but she did not look up.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery,\\r\\nand is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune,\\r\\nanything. There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is not my\\r\\nsecret, but another's.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how to\\r\\ngo on, Miss Havisham repeated, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt is not your secret, but another's.\\r\\nWell?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when I\\r\\nbelonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left,\\r\\nI suppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might have\\r\\ncome,--as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid\\r\\nfor it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAy, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou did.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd that Mr. Jaggers--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Jaggers,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chad\\r\\nnothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. His being my lawyer, and\\r\\nhis being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. He holds the same\\r\\nrelation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise. Be that\\r\\nas it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAny one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no\\r\\nsuppression or evasion so far.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least\\r\\nyou led me on?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she returned, again nodding steadily, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI let you go on.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWas that kind?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWho am I,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor\\r\\nand flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in\\r\\nsurprise,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwho am I, for God's sake, that I should be kind?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it. I\\r\\ntold her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, well, well!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat else?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI was liberally paid for my old attendance here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I said, to soothe\\r\\nher, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cin being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for\\r\\nmy own information. What follows has another (and I hope more\\r\\ndisinterested) purpose. In humoring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you\\r\\npunished--practised on--perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses\\r\\nyour intention, without offence--your self-seeking relations?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been my\\r\\nhistory, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you\\r\\nnot to have it so! You made your own snares. I never made them.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWaiting until she was quiet again,--for this, too, flashed out of her in\\r\\na wild and sudden way,--I went on.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham,\\r\\nand have been constantly among them since I went to London. I know them\\r\\nto have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. And I should be\\r\\nfalse and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you or\\r\\nno, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that you\\r\\ndeeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if you suppose\\r\\nthem to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and incapable of\\r\\nanything designing or mean.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey are your friends,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Havisham.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey made themselves my friends,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhen they supposed me\\r\\nto have superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, and\\r\\nMistress Camilla were not my friends, I think.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do\\r\\nthem good with her. She looked at me keenly for a little while, and then\\r\\nsaid quietly,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you want for them?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOnly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat you would not confound them with the others. They\\r\\nmay be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same\\r\\nnature.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nStill looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you want for them?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am not so cunning, you see,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I said, in answer, conscious that I\\r\\nreddened a little, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas that I could hide from you, even if I desired,\\r\\nthat I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the money\\r\\nto do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from the\\r\\nnature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I could show you\\r\\nhow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy must it be done without his knowledge?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked, settling her\\r\\nhands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more attentively.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI began the service myself, more than two years ago,\\r\\nwithout his knowledge, and I don't want to be betrayed. Why I fail in my\\r\\nability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of the secret which\\r\\nis another person's and not mine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.\\r\\nAfter watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light\\r\\nof the slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by\\r\\nthe collapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again--at\\r\\nfirst, vacantly--then, with a gradually concentrating attention. All\\r\\nthis time Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham had fixed her\\r\\nattention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in our\\r\\ndialogue,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat else?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEstella,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my\\r\\ntrembling voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou know I love you. You know that I have loved you\\r\\nlong and dearly.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her fingers\\r\\nplied their work, and she looked at me with an unmoved countenance. I\\r\\nsaw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and from her to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced me\\r\\nto hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another. While I thought you\\r\\ncould not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it. But I\\r\\nmust say it now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPreserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still going,\\r\\nEstella shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, in answer to that action,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI know. I have no hope\\r\\nthat I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may become\\r\\nof me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I love\\r\\nyou. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shook her\\r\\nhead again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise\\r\\non the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all these\\r\\nyears with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflected on the\\r\\ngravity of what she did. But I think she did not. I think that, in the\\r\\nendurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as she\\r\\nsat looking by turns at Estella and at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt seems,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, very calmly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat there are sentiments,\\r\\nfancies,--I don't know how to call them,--which I am not able to\\r\\ncomprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form\\r\\nof words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touch\\r\\nnothing there. I don't care for what you say at all. I have tried to\\r\\nwarn you of this; now, have I not?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI said in a miserable manner, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.\\r\\nNow, did you not think so?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, and\\r\\nbeautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt is in my nature,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she returned. And then she added, with a stress\\r\\nupon the words, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt is in the nature formed within me. I make a great\\r\\ndifference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can do\\r\\nno more.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs it not true,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat Bentley Drummle is in town here, and\\r\\npursuing you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt is quite true,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied, referring to him with the indifference\\r\\nof utter contempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines with\\r\\nyou this very day?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cQuite true.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou cannot love him, Estella!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do not\\r\\nmean what I say?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou would never marry him, Estella?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her\\r\\nwork in her hands. Then she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy not tell you the truth? I am\\r\\ngoing to be married to him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better\\r\\nthan I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear\\r\\nher say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a\\r\\nghastly look upon Miss Havisham's, that it impressed me, even in my\\r\\npassionate hurry and grief.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEstella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this\\r\\nfatal step. Put me aside for ever,--you have done so, I well know,--but\\r\\nbestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham\\r\\ngives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done\\r\\nto the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly\\r\\nlove you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly,\\r\\nthough he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can bear it\\r\\nbetter, for your sake!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have\\r\\nbeen touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all\\r\\nintelligible to her own mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am going,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said again, in a gentler voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto be married to\\r\\nhim. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be\\r\\nmarried soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by\\r\\nadoption? It is my own act.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYour own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOn whom should I fling myself away?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she retorted, with a smile.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShould I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel (if\\r\\npeople do feel such things) that I took nothing to him? There! It is\\r\\ndone. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband. As to leading\\r\\nme into what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me\\r\\nwait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which\\r\\nhas very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Say no\\r\\nmore. We shall never understand each other.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSuch a mean brute, such a stupid brute!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I urged, in despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDon't be afraid of my being a blessing to him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI shall\\r\\nnot be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionary\\r\\nboy--or man?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO Estella!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, do\\r\\nwhat I would to restrain them; Ã¢\\x80\\x9ceven if I remained in England and could\\r\\nhold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle's wife?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNonsense,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she returned,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnonsense. This will pass in no time.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNever, Estella!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou will get me out of your thoughts in a week.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOut of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You\\r\\nhave been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the\\r\\nrough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been\\r\\nin every prospect I have ever seen since,--on the river, on the sails of\\r\\nthe ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the darkness,\\r\\nin the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You have been\\r\\nthe embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become\\r\\nacquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London buildings\\r\\nare made are not more real, or more impossible to be displaced by your\\r\\nhands, than your presence and influence have been to me, there and\\r\\neverywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my life, you\\r\\ncannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the little good\\r\\nin me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, I associate you only\\r\\nwith the good; and I will faithfully hold you to that always, for you\\r\\nmust have done me far more good than harm, let me feel now what sharp\\r\\ndistress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself, I\\r\\ndon't know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from an\\r\\ninward wound, and gushed out. I held her hand to my lips some lingering\\r\\nmoments, and so I left her. But ever afterwards, I remembered,--and soon\\r\\nafterwards with stronger reason,--that while Estella looked at me merely\\r\\nwith incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand\\r\\nstill covering her heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of\\r\\npity and remorse.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll done, all gone! So much was done and gone, that when I went out at\\r\\nthe gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker color than when I went\\r\\nin. For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and by-paths, and then\\r\\nstruck off to walk all the way to London. For, I had by that time come\\r\\nto myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the inn and\\r\\nsee Drummle there; that I could not bear to sit upon the coach and\\r\\nbe spoken to; that I could do nothing half so good for myself as tire\\r\\nmyself out.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge. Pursuing the narrow\\r\\nintricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the\\r\\nMiddlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to the Temple was\\r\\nclose by the river-side, through Whitefriars. I was not expected till\\r\\nto-morrow; but I had my keys, and, if Herbert were gone to bed, could\\r\\nget to bed myself without disturbing him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the\\r\\nTemple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not take it\\r\\nill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as he held the\\r\\ngate a little way open for me to pass in. To help his memory I mentioned\\r\\nmy name.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so. Here's a note, sir. The\\r\\nmessenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my\\r\\nlantern?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch surprised by the request, I took the note. It was directed to\\r\\nPhilip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the\\r\\nwords, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPLEASE READ THIS, HERE.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I opened it, the watchman holding up\\r\\nhis light, and read inside, in Wemmick's writing,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDON'T GO HOME.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLV\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made\\r\\nthe best of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackney chariot\\r\\nand drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden. In those times a bed was\\r\\nalways to be got there at any hour of the night, and the chamberlain,\\r\\nletting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle next in order on\\r\\nhis shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his\\r\\nlist. It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back, with a\\r\\ndespotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddling over the\\r\\nwhole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into the fireplace\\r\\nand another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched little\\r\\nwashing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in,\\r\\nbefore he left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those\\r\\nvirtuous days--an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which\\r\\ninstantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever be\\r\\nlighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom\\r\\nof a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a staringly\\r\\nwide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, and lay there\\r\\nfootsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more close my own\\r\\neyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus. And thus, in the\\r\\ngloom and death of the night, we stared at one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an\\r\\ninhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I\\r\\nlooked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what\\r\\na number of blue-bottle flies from the butchers', and earwigs from the\\r\\nmarket, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying\\r\\nby for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever\\r\\ntumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,--a\\r\\ndisagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable\\r\\napproaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those\\r\\nextraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves\\r\\naudible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little\\r\\nwashing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the\\r\\nchest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired\\r\\na new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw\\r\\nwritten, DON'T GO HOME.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never warded\\r\\noff this DON'T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I thought of,\\r\\nas a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had read in the\\r\\nnewspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums in the\\r\\nnight, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had been\\r\\nfound in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that he\\r\\nmust have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to\\r\\nassure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door\\r\\nto look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship\\r\\nof a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But\\r\\nall this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,\\r\\nand when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were\\r\\nquestions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed\\r\\nthere could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I\\r\\nthought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when\\r\\nI recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and\\r\\ntones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,--even then I\\r\\nwas pursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don't go home.\\r\\nWhen at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became\\r\\na vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present\\r\\ntense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do\\r\\nnot ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I may not\\r\\nand I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and should\\r\\nnot go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and rolled over\\r\\non the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was plain\\r\\nthat I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally plain\\r\\nthat this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments only could be\\r\\ntaken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been\\r\\nso miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door to startle me\\r\\nfrom my uneasy bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o'clock. The little\\r\\nservant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls, I\\r\\npassed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company,\\r\\nand so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he was\\r\\nmaking tea for himself and the Aged. An open door afforded a perspective\\r\\nview of the Aged in bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHalloa, Mr. Pip!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou did come home, then?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I returned; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I didn't go home.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's all right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, rubbing his hands. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI left a note for you\\r\\nat each of the Temple gates, on the chance. Which gate did you come to?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI told him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI'll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the\\r\\nnotes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit's a good rule never to leave documentary\\r\\nevidence if you can help it, because you don't know when it may be put\\r\\nin. I'm going to take a liberty with you. Would you mind toasting this\\r\\nsausage for the Aged P.?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI said I should be delighted to do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen you can go about your work, Mary Anne,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick to the little\\r\\nservant; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhich leaves us to ourselves, don't you see, Mr. Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nadded, winking, as she disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourse\\r\\nproceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged's sausage and he\\r\\nbuttered the crumb of the Aged's roll.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Mr. Pip, you know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou and I understand one\\r\\nanother. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have been\\r\\nengaged in a confidential transaction before to-day. Official sentiments\\r\\nare one thing. We are extra official.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted\\r\\nthe Aged's sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI accidentally heard, yesterday morning,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbeing in a\\r\\ncertain place where I once took you,--even between you and me, it's as\\r\\nwell not to mention names when avoidable--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMuch better not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI understand you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI heard there by chance, yesterday morning,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat\\r\\na certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not\\r\\nunpossessed of portable property,--I don't know who it may really\\r\\nbe,--we won't name this person--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot necessary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c--Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good\\r\\nmany people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations,\\r\\nand not quite irrespective of the government expense--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Aged's sausage,\\r\\nand greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick's; for which I\\r\\napologized.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c--By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of\\r\\nthereabouts. From which,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cconjectures had been raised and\\r\\ntheories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden Court,\\r\\nTemple, had been watched, and might be watched again.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBy whom?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wouldn't go into that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, evasively, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit might clash with\\r\\nofficial responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heard other\\r\\ncurious things in the same place. I don't tell it you on information\\r\\nreceived. I heard it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke, and set forth\\r\\nthe Aged's breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to placing it\\r\\nbefore him, he went into the Aged's room with a clean white cloth, and\\r\\ntied the same under the old gentleman's chin, and propped him up, and\\r\\nput his nightcap on one side, and gave him quite a rakish air. Then he\\r\\nplaced his breakfast before him with great care, and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAll right,\\r\\nain't you, Aged P.?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d To which the cheerful Aged replied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAll right,\\r\\nJohn, my boy, all right!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d As there seemed to be a tacit understanding\\r\\nthat the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was therefore to be\\r\\nconsidered invisible, I made a pretence of being in complete ignorance\\r\\nof these proceedings.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had reason to\\r\\nsuspect),Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I said to Wemmick when he came back, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis inseparable from the\\r\\nperson to whom you have adverted; is it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWemmick looked very serious. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI couldn't undertake to say that, of my\\r\\nown knowledge. I mean, I couldn't undertake to say it was at first. But\\r\\nit either is, or it will be, or it's in great danger of being.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying\\r\\nas much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out\\r\\nof his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him. But I told\\r\\nhim, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to ask\\r\\nhim a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he\\r\\ndeemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in his\\r\\nbreakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (his\\r\\nnotion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to me\\r\\nonce, to put my question.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is\\r\\nCompeyson?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe answered with one other nod.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs he living?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOne other nod.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs he in London?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave\\r\\nme one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cquestioning being over,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d which he emphasized and\\r\\nrepeated for my guidance, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI come to what I did, after hearing what I\\r\\nheard. I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to\\r\\nClarriker's to find Mr. Herbert.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd him you found?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, with great anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd him I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any\\r\\ndetails, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody--Tom,\\r\\nJack, or Richard--being about the chambers, or about the immediate\\r\\nneighborhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way\\r\\nwhile you were out of the way.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe would be greatly puzzled what to do?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe was puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him my opinion\\r\\nthat it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too far out\\r\\nof the way at present. Mr. Pip, I'll tell you something. Under existing\\r\\ncircumstances, there is no place like a great city when you are once\\r\\nin it. Don't break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things slacken,\\r\\nbefore you try the open, even for foreign air.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert had\\r\\ndone?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Herbert,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cafter being all of a heap for half an\\r\\nhour, struck out a plan. He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is\\r\\ncourting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden\\r\\nPa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a\\r\\nbow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river. You\\r\\nare acquainted with the young lady, most probably?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot personally,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion\\r\\nwho did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to\\r\\npresent me to her, she had received the proposal with such very moderate\\r\\nwarmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of\\r\\nthe case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time before I made\\r\\nher acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Herbert's prospects by\\r\\nstealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy: he and\\r\\nhis affianced, for their part, had naturally not been very anxious to\\r\\nintroduce a third person into their interviews; and thus, although I was\\r\\nassured that I had risen in Clara's esteem, and although the young\\r\\nlady and I had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by\\r\\nHerbert, I had never seen her. However, I did not trouble Wemmick with\\r\\nthese particulars.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe house with the bow-window,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbeing by the river-side,\\r\\ndown the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and being kept, it\\r\\nseems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to\\r\\nlet, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that as a temporary\\r\\ntenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard? Now, I thought very well of it, for\\r\\nthree reasons I'll give you. That is to say: Firstly. It's altogether\\r\\nout of all your beats, and is well away from the usual heap of streets\\r\\ngreat and small. Secondly. Without going near it yourself, you could\\r\\nalways hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard, through Mr. Herbert.\\r\\nThirdly. After a while and when it might be prudent, if you should want\\r\\nto slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a foreign packet-boat, there he\\r\\nis--ready.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and\\r\\nagain, and begged him to proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will, and\\r\\nby nine o'clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or Richard,--whichever\\r\\nit may be,--you and I don't want to know,--quite successfully. At the\\r\\nold lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to Dover, and, in\\r\\nfact, he was taken down the Dover road and cornered out of it. Now,\\r\\nanother great advantage of all this is, that it was done without you,\\r\\nand when, if any one was concerning himself about your movements, you\\r\\nmust be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged.\\r\\nThis diverts suspicion and confuses it; and for the same reason I\\r\\nrecommended that, even if you came back last night, you should not go\\r\\nhome. It brings in more confusion, and you want confusion.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWemmick, having finished his breakfast, here looked at his watch, and\\r\\nbegan to get his coat on.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd now, Mr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, with his hands still in the sleeves, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nhave probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more,--from\\r\\na Walworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personal\\r\\ncapacity,--I shall be glad to do it. Here's the address. There can be\\r\\nno harm in your going here to-night, and seeing for yourself that all is\\r\\nwell with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home,--which is another\\r\\nreason for your not going home last night. But, after you have gone\\r\\nhome, don't go back here. You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr. PipÃ¢\\x80\\x9d; his\\r\\nhands were now out of his sleeves, and I was shaking them; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand let me\\r\\nfinally impress one important point upon you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He laid his hands upon\\r\\nmy shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAvail yourself of this\\r\\nevening to lay hold of his portable property. You don't know what may\\r\\nhappen to him. Don't let anything happen to the portable property.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nQuite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, I\\r\\nforbore to try.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTime's up,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I must be off. If you had nothing more\\r\\npressing to do than to keep here till dark, that's what I should advise.\\r\\nYou look very much worried, and it would do you good to have a perfectly\\r\\nquiet day with the Aged,--he'll be up presently,--and a little bit\\r\\nof--you remember the pig?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf course,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell; and a little bit of him. That sausage you toasted was his, and\\r\\nhe was in all respects a first-rater. Do try him, if it is only for old\\r\\nacquaintance sake. Good-bye, Aged Parent!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d in a cheery shout.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAll right, John; all right, my boy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d piped the old man from within.\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon fell asleep before Wemmick's fire, and the Aged and I enjoyed one\\r\\nanother's society by falling asleep before it more or less all day.\\r\\nWe had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate; and\\r\\nI nodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do it\\r\\ndrowsily. When it was quite dark, I left the Aged preparing the fire for\\r\\ntoast; and I inferred from the number of teacups, as well as from his\\r\\nglances at the two little doors in the wall, that Miss Skiffins was\\r\\nexpected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLVI\\r\\n\\r\\nEight o'clock had struck before I got into the air, that was scented,\\r\\nnot disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the long-shore\\r\\nboat-builders, and mast, oar, and block makers. All that water-side\\r\\nregion of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge was unknown ground to\\r\\nme; and when I struck down by the river, I found that the spot I wanted\\r\\nwas not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything but easy to\\r\\nfind. It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks's Basin; and I had no other\\r\\nguide to Chinks's Basin than the Old Green Copper Rope-walk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myself\\r\\namong, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces,\\r\\nwhat ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards of ship-builders\\r\\nand ship-breakers, what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground,\\r\\nthough for years off duty, what mountainous country of accumulated casks\\r\\nand timber, how many rope-walks that were not the Old Green Copper. After\\r\\nseveral times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting\\r\\nit, I came unexpectedly round a corner, upon Mill Pond Bank. It was a\\r\\nfresh kind of place, all circumstances considered, where the wind from\\r\\nthe river had room to turn itself round; and there were two or three\\r\\ntrees in it, and there was the stump of a ruined windmill, and there\\r\\nwas the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,--whose long and narrow vista I could\\r\\ntrace in the moonlight, along a series of wooden frames set in the\\r\\nground, that looked like superannuated haymaking-rakes which had grown\\r\\nold and lost most of their teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with a\\r\\nwooden front and three stories of bow-window (not bay-window, which is\\r\\nanother thing), I looked at the plate upon the door, and read there,\\r\\nMrs. Whimple. That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderly\\r\\nwoman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded. She was\\r\\nimmediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into\\r\\nthe parlor and shut the door. It was an odd sensation to see his very\\r\\nfamiliar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room\\r\\nand region; and I found myself looking at him, much as I looked at\\r\\nthe corner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon the\\r\\nchimney-piece, and the colored engravings on the wall, representing the\\r\\ndeath of Captain Cook, a ship-launch, and his Majesty King George the\\r\\nThird in a state coachman's wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots, on the\\r\\nterrace at Windsor.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAll is well, Handel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand he is quite satisfied, though\\r\\neager to see you. My dear girl is with her father; and if you'll wait\\r\\ntill she comes down, I'll make you known to her, and then we'll go upstairs.\\r\\nThat's her father.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probably\\r\\nexpressed the fact in my countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am afraid he is a sad old rascal,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, smiling, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I have\\r\\nnever seen him. Don't you smell rum? He is always at it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt rum?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand you may suppose how mild it makes his\\r\\ngout. He persists, too, in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his\\r\\nroom, and serving them out. He keeps them on shelves over his head, and\\r\\nwill weigh them all. His room must be like a chandler's shop.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and\\r\\nthen died away.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat else can be the consequence,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, in explanation, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif\\r\\nhe will cut the cheese? A man with the gout in his right hand--and\\r\\neverywhere else--can't expect to get through a Double Gloucester without\\r\\nhurting himself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he gave another furious\\r\\nroar.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTo have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs. Whimple,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor of course people in general won't stand that noise. A\\r\\ncurious place, Handel; isn't it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMrs. Whimple,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, when I told him so, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis the best of\\r\\nhousewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do without\\r\\nher motherly help. For, Clara has no mother of her own, Handel, and no\\r\\nrelation in the world but old Gruffandgrim.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSurely that's not his name, Herbert?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat's my name for him. His name is Mr. Barley.\\r\\nBut what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a\\r\\ngirl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself or anybody\\r\\nelse about her family!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that he\\r\\nfirst knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education at\\r\\nan establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her being recalled home\\r\\nto nurse her father, he and she had confided their affection to the\\r\\nmotherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated\\r\\nwith equal kindness and discretion, ever since. It was understood that\\r\\nnothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by\\r\\nreason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject\\r\\nmore psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser's stores.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley's sustained\\r\\ngrowl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room door\\r\\nopened, and a very pretty, slight, dark-eyed girl of twenty or so came\\r\\nin with a basket in her hand: whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the\\r\\nbasket, and presented, blushing, as Ã¢\\x80\\x9cClara.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She really was a most\\r\\ncharming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom that\\r\\ntruculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his service.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLook here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate\\r\\nand tender smile, after we had talked a little; Ã¢\\x80\\x9chere's poor Clara's\\r\\nsupper, served out every night. Here's her allowance of bread, and\\r\\nhere's her slice of cheese, and here's her rum,--which I drink. This\\r\\nis Mr. Barley's breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be cooked. Two\\r\\nmutton-chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two\\r\\nounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper. It's\\r\\nstewed up together, and taken hot, and it's a nice thing for the gout, I\\r\\nshould think!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was something so natural and winning in Clara's resigned way of\\r\\nlooking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; and\\r\\nsomething so confiding, loving, and innocent in her modest manner of\\r\\nyielding herself to Herbert's embracing arm; and something so gentle in\\r\\nher, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks's Basin,\\r\\nand the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, with Old Barley growling in the\\r\\nbeam,--that I would not have undone the engagement between her and\\r\\nHerbert for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly the\\r\\ngrowl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise was heard\\r\\nabove, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through\\r\\nthe ceiling to come at us. Upon this Clara said to Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPapa wants\\r\\nme, darling!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and ran away.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere is an unconscionable old shark for you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do\\r\\nyou suppose he wants now, Handel?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSomething to drink?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's it!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary\\r\\nmerit. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table.\\r\\nWait a moment, and you'll hear Clara lift him up to take some. There\\r\\nhe goes!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nHerbert, as it was succeeded by silence, Ã¢\\x80\\x9che's drinking. Now,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nHerbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, Ã¢\\x80\\x9che's down again\\r\\non his back!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nClara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me upstairs to\\r\\nsee our charge. As we passed Mr. Barley's door, he was heard hoarsely\\r\\nmuttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the\\r\\nfollowing Refrain, in which I substitute good wishes for something quite\\r\\nthe reverse:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAhoy! Bless your eyes, here's old Bill Barley. Here's old Bill Barley,\\r\\nbless your eyes. Here's old Bill Barley on the flat of his back, by the\\r\\nLord. Lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder,\\r\\nhere's your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy! Bless you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barley\\r\\nwould commune with himself by the day and night together; Often, while\\r\\nit was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which was\\r\\nfitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and\\r\\nairy, and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below, I found\\r\\nProvis comfortably settled. He expressed no alarm, and seemed to\\r\\nfeel none that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that he was\\r\\nsoftened,--indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could never\\r\\nafterwards recall how when I tried, but certainly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opportunity that the day's rest had given me for reflection had\\r\\nresulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting\\r\\nCompeyson. For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man\\r\\nmight otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own\\r\\ndestruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by his\\r\\nfire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick's judgment\\r\\nand sources of information?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAy, ay, dear boy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he answered, with a grave nod, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cJaggers knows.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen, I have talked with Wemmick,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand have come to tell you\\r\\nwhat caution he gave me and what advice.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told\\r\\nhim how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers or\\r\\nprisoners I could not say), that he was under some suspicion, and that\\r\\nmy chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his keeping\\r\\nclose for a time, and my keeping away from him; and what Wemmick had\\r\\nsaid about getting him abroad. I added, that of course, when the time\\r\\ncame, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might\\r\\nbe safest in Wemmick's judgment. What was to follow that I did not touch\\r\\nupon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about it in my\\r\\nown mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and in declared\\r\\nperil for my sake. As to altering my way of living by enlarging my\\r\\nexpenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult\\r\\ncircumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it were no worse?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His\\r\\ncoming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a\\r\\nventure. He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he had\\r\\nvery little fear of his safety with such good help.\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said\\r\\nthat something had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick's\\r\\nsuggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe are both good\\r\\nwatermen, Handel, and could take him down the river ourselves when the\\r\\nright time comes. No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no\\r\\nboatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance\\r\\nis worth saving. Never mind the season; don't you think it might be a\\r\\ngood thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs, and\\r\\nwere in the habit of rowing up and down the river? You fall into that\\r\\nhabit, and then who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty times,\\r\\nand there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or\\r\\nfifty-first.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. We agreed\\r\\nthat it should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never\\r\\nrecognize us if we came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank. But\\r\\nwe further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his\\r\\nwindow which gave upon the east, whenever he saw us and all was right.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go;\\r\\nremarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home together, and\\r\\nthat I would take half an hour's start of him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't like to leave\\r\\nyou here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I said to Provis, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthough I cannot doubt your being safer\\r\\nhere than near me. Good-bye!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he answered, clasping my hands, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't know when we may\\r\\nmeet again, and I don't like good-bye. Say good night!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood night! Herbert will go regularly between us, and when the time\\r\\ncomes you may be certain I shall be ready. Good night, good night!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms; and we left him\\r\\non the landing outside his door, holding a light over the stair-rail to\\r\\nlight us downstairs. Looking back at him, I thought of the first night\\r\\nof his return, when our positions were reversed, and when I little\\r\\nsupposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him\\r\\nas it was now.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door, with no\\r\\nappearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. When we got to the\\r\\nfoot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the name of\\r\\nProvis. He replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr. Campbell.\\r\\nHe also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there was,\\r\\nthat he (Herbert) had Mr. Campbell consigned to him, and felt a strong\\r\\npersonal interest in his being well cared for, and living a secluded\\r\\nlife. So, when we went into the parlor where Mrs. Whimple and Clara were\\r\\nseated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr. Campbell, but\\r\\nkept it to myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, dark-eyed girl, and of the\\r\\nmotherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little\\r\\naffair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope-walk had\\r\\ngrown quite a different place. Old Barley might be as old as the hills,\\r\\nand might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there were redeeming\\r\\nyouth and trust and hope enough in Chinks's Basin to fill it to\\r\\noverflowing. And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, and went\\r\\nhome very sadly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them. The\\r\\nwindows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark\\r\\nand still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past the\\r\\nfountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between\\r\\nme and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert, coming to my\\r\\nbedside when he came in,--for I went straight to bed, dispirited and\\r\\nfatigued,--made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that,\\r\\nhe looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was as\\r\\nsolemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boat\\r\\nwas brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach\\r\\nher within a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and\\r\\npractice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in\\r\\ncold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been\\r\\nout a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the\\r\\nhours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old\\r\\nLondon Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there\\r\\nwas a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But I\\r\\nknew well enough how to 'shoot' the bridge after seeing it done, and so\\r\\nbegan to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to Erith.\\r\\nThe first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were pulling a\\r\\npair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the blind towards\\r\\nthe east come down. Herbert was rarely there less frequently than three\\r\\ntimes in a week, and he never brought me a single word of intelligence\\r\\nthat was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there was cause for alarm,\\r\\nand I could not get rid of the notion of being watched. Once received,\\r\\nit is a haunting idea; how many undesigning persons I suspected of\\r\\nwatching me, it would be hard to calculate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding.\\r\\nHerbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at\\r\\none of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down, and to\\r\\nthink that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards Clara. But\\r\\nI thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch, and that\\r\\nany black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going swiftly,\\r\\nsilently, and surely, to take him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLVII\\r\\n\\r\\nSome weeks passed without bringing any change. We waited for Wemmick,\\r\\nand he made no sign. If I had never known him out of Little Britain, and\\r\\nhad never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the\\r\\nCastle, I might have doubted him; not so for a moment, knowing him as I\\r\\ndid.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed\\r\\nfor money by more than one creditor. Even I myself began to know the\\r\\nwant of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket), and to relieve\\r\\nit by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash. But\\r\\nI had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more\\r\\nmoney from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and\\r\\nplans. Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocket-book by Herbert, to\\r\\nhold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction--whether it\\r\\nwas a false kind or a true, I hardly know--in not having profited by his\\r\\ngenerosity since his revelation of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella\\r\\nwas married. Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but a\\r\\nconviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert (to whom I had\\r\\nconfided the circumstances of our last interview) never to speak of her\\r\\nto me. Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of\\r\\nhope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know? Why did you\\r\\nwho read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last\\r\\nyear, last month, last week?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an unhappy life that I lived; and its one dominant anxiety,\\r\\ntowering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above a\\r\\nrange of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new cause\\r\\nfor fear arose. Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror\\r\\nfresh upon me that he was discovered; let me sit listening, as I would\\r\\nwith dread, for Herbert's returning step at night, lest it should be\\r\\nfleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,--for all that, and\\r\\nmuch more to like purpose, the round of things went on. Condemned to\\r\\ninaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed\\r\\nabout in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I could\\r\\nnot get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings of old London\\r\\nBridge; then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House, to be\\r\\nbrought up afterwards to the Temple stairs. I was not averse to doing\\r\\nthis, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the\\r\\nwater-side people there. From this slight occasion sprang two meetings\\r\\nthat I have now to tell of.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the wharf\\r\\nat dusk. I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide, and\\r\\nhad turned with the tide. It had been a fine bright day, but had become\\r\\nfoggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way back among the\\r\\nshipping, pretty carefully. Both in going and returning, I had seen the\\r\\nsignal in his window, All well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfort\\r\\nmyself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and solitude\\r\\nbefore me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would afterwards go\\r\\nto the play. The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved his questionable\\r\\ntriumph was in that water-side neighborhood (it is nowhere now), and\\r\\nto that theatre I resolved to go. I was aware that Mr. Wopsle had\\r\\nnot succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the contrary, had rather\\r\\npartaken of its decline. He had been ominously heard of, through the\\r\\nplay-bills, as a faithful Black, in connection with a little girl of\\r\\nnoble birth, and a monkey. And Herbert had seen him as a predatory\\r\\nTartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red brick, and an\\r\\noutrageous hat all over bells.\\r\\n\\r\\nI dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house,\\r\\nwhere there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every half-yard\\r\\nof the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the knives,--to\\r\\nthis day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the Lord Mayor's\\r\\ndominions which is not geographical,--and wore out the time in dozing\\r\\nover crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of dinners. By\\r\\nand by, I roused myself, and went to the play.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere, I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majesty's service,--a most\\r\\nexcellent man, though I could have wished his trousers not quite so\\r\\ntight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,--who knocked all\\r\\nthe little men's hats over their eyes, though he was very generous and\\r\\nbrave, and who wouldn't hear of anybody's paying taxes, though he was\\r\\nvery patriotic. He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding in\\r\\nthe cloth, and on that property married a young person in bed-furniture,\\r\\nwith great rejoicings; the whole population of Portsmouth (nine in\\r\\nnumber at the last census) turning out on the beach to rub their own\\r\\nhands and shake everybody else's, and sing Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFill, fill!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d A certain\\r\\ndark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn't fill, or do anything else\\r\\nthat was proposed to him, and whose heart was openly stated (by the\\r\\nboatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposed to two other\\r\\nSwabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was so effectually\\r\\ndone (the Swab family having considerable political influence) that it\\r\\ntook half the evening to set things right, and then it was only brought\\r\\nabout through an honest little grocer with a white hat, black gaiters,\\r\\nand red nose, getting into a clock, with a gridiron, and listening, and\\r\\ncoming out, and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron\\r\\nwhom he couldn't confute with what he had overheard. This led to Mr.\\r\\nWopsle's (who had never been heard of before) coming in with a star\\r\\nand garter on, as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the\\r\\nAdmiralty, to say that the Swabs were all to go to prison on the spot,\\r\\nand that he had brought the boatswain down the Union Jack, as a slight\\r\\nacknowledgment of his public services. The boatswain, unmanned for the\\r\\nfirst time, respectfully dried his eyes on the Jack, and then cheering\\r\\nup, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your Honor, solicited permission to\\r\\ntake him by the fin. Mr. Wopsle, conceding his fin with a gracious\\r\\ndignity, was immediately shoved into a dusty corner, while everybody\\r\\ndanced a hornpipe; and from that corner, surveying the public with a\\r\\ndiscontented eye, became aware of me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in\\r\\nthe first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected\\r\\nMr. Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric\\r\\ncountenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged\\r\\nin the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great\\r\\ncowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner.\\r\\nBut he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for,\\r\\nthe Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,--on account of\\r\\nthe parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice\\r\\nof his daughter's heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a\\r\\nflour-sack, out of the first-floor window,--summoned a sententious\\r\\nEnchanter; and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily, after\\r\\nan apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a high-crowned\\r\\nhat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm. The business\\r\\nof this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked at, sung at,\\r\\nbutted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various colors,\\r\\nhe had a good deal of time on his hands. And I observed, with great\\r\\nsurprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were\\r\\nlost in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.\\r\\nWopsle's eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his\\r\\nmind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out. I sat\\r\\nthinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large\\r\\nwatch-case, and still I could not make it out. I was still thinking\\r\\nof it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him\\r\\nwaiting for me near the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow do you do?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, shaking hands with him as we turned down the\\r\\nstreet together. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI saw that you saw me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSaw you, Mr. Pip!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes, of course I saw you. But who else\\r\\nwas there?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWho else?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt is the strangest thing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lost\\r\\nlook again; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand yet I could swear to him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBecoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI can't be positive;\\r\\nyet I think I should.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInvoluntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round me\\r\\nwhen I went home; for these mysterious words gave me a chill.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh! He can't be in sight,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wopsle. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe went out before I went\\r\\noff. I saw him go.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving the reason that I had for being suspicious, I even suspected\\r\\nthis poor actor. I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission.\\r\\nTherefore I glanced at him as we walked on together, but said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I saw\\r\\nthat you were quite unconscious of him, sitting behind you there like a\\r\\nghost.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speak\\r\\nyet, for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on\\r\\nto induce me to connect these references with Provis. Of course, I was\\r\\nperfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip; indeed, I see you do. But it is\\r\\nso very strange! You'll hardly believe what I am going to tell you. I\\r\\ncould hardly believe it myself, if you told me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIndeed?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed. Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain Christmas Day,\\r\\nwhen you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery's, and some soldiers\\r\\ncame to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI remember it very well.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and that we\\r\\njoined in it, and that Gargery took you on his back, and that I took the\\r\\nlead, and you kept up with me as well as you could?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI remember it all very well.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Better than he thought,--except the last\\r\\nclause.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that\\r\\nthere was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been severely\\r\\nhandled and much mauled about the face by the other?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI see it all before me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre,\\r\\nand that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes,\\r\\nwith the torchlight shining on their faces,--I am particular about\\r\\nthat,--with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an\\r\\nouter ring of dark night all about us?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI remember all that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight. I saw\\r\\nhim over your shoulder.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSteady!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I thought. I asked him then, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhich of the two do you suppose\\r\\nyou saw?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe one who had been mauled,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he answered readily, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I'll swear I\\r\\nsaw him! The more I think of him, the more certain I am of him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is very curious!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, with the best assumption I could put on\\r\\nof its being nothing more to me. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cVery curious indeed!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation\\r\\nthrew me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson's\\r\\nhaving been behind me Ã¢\\x80\\x9clike a ghost.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d For if he had ever been out of my\\r\\nthoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it was\\r\\nin those very moments when he was closest to me; and to think that I\\r\\nshould be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if\\r\\nI had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out, and then had\\r\\nfound him at my elbow. I could not doubt, either, that he was there,\\r\\nbecause I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of danger\\r\\nthere might be about us, danger was always near and active.\\r\\n\\r\\nI put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in? He\\r\\ncould not tell me that; he saw me, and over my shoulder he saw the man.\\r\\nIt was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify\\r\\nhim; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me, and\\r\\nknown him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time. How was\\r\\nhe dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought, in\\r\\nblack. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not. I believed\\r\\nnot too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no especial\\r\\nnotice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a face at all\\r\\ndisfigured would have attracted my attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or I\\r\\nextract, and when I had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment,\\r\\nafter the fatigues of the evening, we parted. It was between twelve and\\r\\none o'clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates were shut. No one\\r\\nwas near me when I went in and went home.\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire. But\\r\\nthere was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick what I\\r\\nhad that night found out, and to remind him that we waited for his hint.\\r\\nAs I thought that I might compromise him if I went too often to the\\r\\nCastle, I made this communication by letter. I wrote it before I went to\\r\\nbed, and went out and posted it; and again no one was near me. Herbert\\r\\nand I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious. And\\r\\nwe were very cautious indeed,--more cautious than before, if that were\\r\\npossible,--and I for my part never went near Chinks's Basin, except\\r\\nwhen I rowed by, and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank as I looked at\\r\\nanything else.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred\\r\\nabout a week after the first. I had again left my boat at the wharf\\r\\nbelow Bridge; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and,\\r\\nundecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and was\\r\\nstrolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busy\\r\\nconcourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one\\r\\novertaking me. It was Mr. Jaggers's hand, and he passed it through my\\r\\narm.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together. Where\\r\\nare you bound for?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFor the Temple, I think,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDon't you know?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I returned, glad for once to get the better of him in\\r\\ncross-examination, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI do not know, for I have not made up my mind.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are going to dine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou don't mind admitting\\r\\nthat, I suppose?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I returned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't mind admitting that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd are not engaged?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't mind admitting also that I am not engaged.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccome and dine with me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was going to excuse myself, when he added, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWemmick's coming.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d So\\r\\nI changed my excuse into an acceptance,--the few words I had uttered,\\r\\nserving for the beginning of either,--and we went along Cheapside\\r\\nand slanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up\\r\\nbrilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely\\r\\nfinding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the\\r\\nafternoon's bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out,\\r\\nopening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at\\r\\nthe Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing,\\r\\nhand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed the\\r\\nbusiness of the day. As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers's fire, its rising\\r\\nand falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were\\r\\nplaying a diabolical game at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse,\\r\\nfat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in a\\r\\ncorner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as if in remembrance of\\r\\na host of hanged clients.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackney-coach: And,\\r\\nas soon as we got there, dinner was served. Although I should not have\\r\\nthought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much\\r\\nas a look to Wemmick's Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no\\r\\nobjection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way. But it\\r\\nwas not to be done. He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he raised\\r\\nthem from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as if there were\\r\\ntwin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid you send that note of Miss Havisham's to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr.\\r\\nJaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Wemmick; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit was going by post, when you brought Mr.\\r\\nPip into the office. Here it is.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He handed it to his principal instead\\r\\nof to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's a note of two lines, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, Ã¢\\x80\\x9csent\\r\\nup to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of your\\r\\naddress. She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of\\r\\nbusiness you mentioned to her. You'll go down?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in those\\r\\nterms.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen do you think of going down?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have an impending engagement,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was\\r\\nputting fish into the post-office, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat renders me rather uncertain of\\r\\nmy time. At once, I think.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick to Mr.\\r\\nJaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9che needn't write an answer, you know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nReceiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I settled\\r\\nthat I would go to-morrow, and said so. Wemmick drank a glass of wine,\\r\\nand looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but not at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo, Pip! Our friend the Spider,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chas played his\\r\\ncards. He has won the pool.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was as much as I could do to assent.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHah! He is a promising fellow--in his way--but he may not have it all\\r\\nhis own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to\\r\\nbe found out first. If he should turn to, and beat her--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSurely,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou do not\\r\\nseriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI didn't say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If he should turn to and\\r\\nbeat her, he may possibly get the strength on his side; if it should be\\r\\na question of intellect, he certainly will not. It would be chance\\r\\nwork to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such\\r\\ncircumstances, because it's a toss-up between two results.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMay I ask what they are?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA fellow like our friend the Spider,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d answered Mr. Jaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ceither\\r\\nbeats or cringes. He may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; but\\r\\nhe either beats or cringes. Ask Wemmick his opinion.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEither beats or cringes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, not at all addressing himself\\r\\nto me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo here's to Mrs. Bentley Drummle,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, taking a decanter\\r\\nof choicer wine from his dumb-waiter, and filling for each of us and\\r\\nfor himself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand may the question of supremacy be settled to the lady's\\r\\nsatisfaction! To the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman,\\r\\nit never will be. Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow you are\\r\\nto-day!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was at his elbow when he addressed her, putting a dish upon the\\r\\ntable. As she withdrew her hands from it, she fell back a step or two,\\r\\nnervously muttering some excuse. And a certain action of her fingers, as\\r\\nshe spoke, arrested my attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat's the matter?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNothing. Only the subject we were speaking of,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwas rather\\r\\npainful to me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe action of her fingers was like the action of knitting. She stood\\r\\nlooking at her master, not understanding whether she was free to go, or\\r\\nwhether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go.\\r\\nHer look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and such\\r\\nhands on a memorable occasion very lately!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dismissed her, and she glided out of the room. But she remained\\r\\nbefore me as plainly as if she were still there. I looked at those\\r\\nhands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I\\r\\ncompared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of,\\r\\nand with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband\\r\\nand a stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of the\\r\\nhousekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over\\r\\nme when I last walked--not alone--in the ruined garden, and through the\\r\\ndeserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when I\\r\\nsaw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach\\r\\nwindow; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like\\r\\nlightning, when I had passed in a carriage--not alone--through a sudden\\r\\nglare of light in a dark street. I thought how one link of association\\r\\nhad helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,\\r\\nwanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a\\r\\nchance swift from Estella's name to the fingers with their knitting\\r\\naction, and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that this\\r\\nwoman was Estella's mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed\\r\\nthe sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He nodded when I said\\r\\nthe subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the\\r\\nwine again, and went on with his dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay in the\\r\\nroom was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her. But her hands\\r\\nwere Estella's hands, and her eyes were Estella's eyes, and if she had\\r\\nreappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less\\r\\nsure that my conviction was the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his wine, when it came round,\\r\\nquite as a matter of business,--just as he might have drawn his salary\\r\\nwhen that came round,--and with his eyes on his chief, sat in a state of\\r\\nperpetual readiness for cross-examination. As to the quantity of wine,\\r\\nhis post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-office\\r\\nfor its quantity of letters. From my point of view, he was the wrong\\r\\ntwin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were groping\\r\\namong Mr. Jaggers's stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right\\r\\ntwin was on his way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down\\r\\nGerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I was\\r\\nwalking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had\\r\\nevaporated into the evening air.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat's over! He's a wonderful man, without his\\r\\nliving likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine\\r\\nwith him,--and I dine more comfortably unscrewed.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWouldn't say it to anybody but yourself,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he answered. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI know that\\r\\nwhat is said between you and me goes no further.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham's adopted daughter, Mrs.\\r\\nBentley Drummle. He said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke\\r\\nof the Aged and of Miss Skiffins. He looked rather sly when I mentioned\\r\\nMiss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his nose, with a roll\\r\\nof the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWemmick,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdo you remember telling me, before I first went to\\r\\nMr. Jaggers's private house, to notice that housekeeper?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid I?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAh, I dare say I did. Deuce take me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added,\\r\\nsuddenly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA wild beast tamed, you called her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd what do you call her?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's his secret. She has been with him many a long year.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wish you would tell me her story. I feel a particular interest in\\r\\nbeing acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me\\r\\ngoes no further.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Wemmick replied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't know her story,--that is, I don't know\\r\\nall of it. But what I do know I'll tell you. We are in our private and\\r\\npersonal capacities, of course.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf course.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for\\r\\nmurder, and was acquitted. She was a very handsome young woman, and I\\r\\nbelieve had some gypsy blood in her. Anyhow, it was hot enough when it\\r\\nwas up, as you may suppose.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut she was acquitted.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Jaggers was for her,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pursued Wemmick, with a look full of meaning,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cand worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a desperate\\r\\ncase, and it was comparatively early days with him then, and he worked\\r\\nit to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to have made\\r\\nhim. He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day for many\\r\\ndays, contending against even a committal; and at the trial where he\\r\\ncouldn't work it himself, sat under counsel, and--every one knew--put\\r\\nin all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,--a woman a\\r\\ngood ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger. It was\\r\\na case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman in\\r\\nGerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick (as\\r\\nwe say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy.\\r\\nThe murdered woman,--more a match for the man, certainly, in point of\\r\\nyears--was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had been a\\r\\nviolent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched and\\r\\ntorn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now, there\\r\\nwas no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman, and\\r\\non the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr. Jaggers\\r\\nprincipally rested his case. You may be sure,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, touching me\\r\\non the sleeve, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then,\\r\\nthough he sometimes does now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner\\r\\nparty.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, sir!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Wemmick went on; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit happened--happened, don't you\\r\\nsee?--that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of\\r\\nher apprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in\\r\\nparticular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully\\r\\ncontrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a bruise\\r\\nor two about her,--nothing for a tramp,--but the backs of her hands\\r\\nwere lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails? Now, Mr.\\r\\nJaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles\\r\\nwhich were not as high as her face; but which she could not have got\\r\\nthrough and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles were\\r\\nactually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the fact that\\r\\nthe brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken\\r\\nthrough, and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of\\r\\nblood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made was this:\\r\\nit was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that she was\\r\\nunder strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the murder,\\r\\nfrantically destroyed her child by this man--some three years old--to\\r\\nrevenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe say\\r\\nthese are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and we show\\r\\nyou the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and you set\\r\\nup the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept all\\r\\nconsequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have\\r\\ndestroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have scratched\\r\\nher hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder of her\\r\\nchild; why don't you? As to this case, if you will have scratches,\\r\\nwe say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted for them,\\r\\nassuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTo\\r\\nsum up, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Jaggers was altogether too many for the\\r\\njury, and they gave in.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHas she been in his service ever since?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes; but not only that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cshe went into his service\\r\\nimmediately after her acquittal, tamed as she is now. She has since been\\r\\ntaught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but she was tamed\\r\\nfrom the beginning.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you remember the sex of the child?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSaid to have been a girl.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou have nothing more to say to me to-night?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter for\\r\\nmy thoughts, though with no relief from the old.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLIX\\r\\n\\r\\nPutting Miss Havisham's note in my pocket, that it might serve as\\r\\nmy credentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case her\\r\\nwaywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me, I went\\r\\ndown again by the coach next day. But I alighted at the Halfway House,\\r\\nand breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for I sought\\r\\nto get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to leave it\\r\\nin the same manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet echoing\\r\\ncourts behind the High Street. The nooks of ruin where the old monks had\\r\\nonce had their refectories and gardens, and where the strong walls were\\r\\nnow pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables, were almost\\r\\nas silent as the old monks in their graves. The cathedral chimes had at\\r\\nonce a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried on avoiding\\r\\nobservation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell of the old\\r\\norgan was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the rooks, as they\\r\\nhovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high trees of the\\r\\npriory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was changed, and that\\r\\nEstella was gone out of it for ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who\\r\\nlived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the\\r\\ngate. The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old,\\r\\nand I took it up and ascended the staircase alone. Miss Havisham was not\\r\\nin her own room, but was in the larger room across the landing. Looking\\r\\nin at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her sitting on the hearth\\r\\nin a ragged chair, close before, and lost in the contemplation of, the\\r\\nashy fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old\\r\\nchimney-piece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes. There\\r\\nwas an air of utter loneliness upon her, that would have moved me to\\r\\npity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could charge\\r\\nher with. As I stood compassionating her, and thinking how, in the\\r\\nprogress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of\\r\\nthat house, her eyes rested on me. She stared, and said in a low voice,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs it real?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost\\r\\nno time.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThank you. Thank you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I\\r\\nremarked a new expression on her face, as if she were afraid of me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI want,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you\\r\\nwere last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. But perhaps you\\r\\ncan never believe, now, that there is anything human in my heart?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I said some reassuring words, she stretched out her tremulous right\\r\\nhand, as though she was going to touch me; but she recalled it again\\r\\nbefore I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do\\r\\nsomething useful and good. Something that you would like done, is it\\r\\nnot?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSomething that I would like done very much.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership. I had\\r\\nnot got far into it, when I judged from her looks that she was thinking\\r\\nin a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It seemed to be\\r\\nso; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she showed\\r\\nthat she was conscious of the fact.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you break off,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked then, with her former air of being afraid\\r\\nof me, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbecause you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I answered, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stopped\\r\\nbecause I thought you were not following what I said.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I was not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she answered, putting a hand to her head. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBegin\\r\\nagain, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was\\r\\nhabitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of\\r\\nforcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told her\\r\\nhow I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how\\r\\nin this I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I reminded her)\\r\\ninvolved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they\\r\\nwere the weighty secrets of another.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said she, assenting with her head, but not looking at me. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd how\\r\\nmuch money is wanting to complete the purchase?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNine\\r\\nhundred pounds.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as\\r\\nyou have kept your own?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cQuite as faithfully.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd your mind will be more at rest?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMuch more at rest.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you very unhappy now?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an unwonted\\r\\ntone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my voice failed\\r\\nme. She put her left arm across the head of her stick, and softly laid\\r\\nher forehead on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of disquiet\\r\\nthan any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a little while, she raised her head, and looked at the fire again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of\\r\\nunhappiness. Is it true?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cToo true.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCan I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that as\\r\\ndone, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for the\\r\\ntone of the question. But there is nothing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted room\\r\\nfor the means of writing. There were none there, and she took from her\\r\\npocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and\\r\\nwrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from\\r\\nher neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cQuite. I dined with him yesterday.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is an authority to him to pay you that money, to lay out at your\\r\\nirresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here; but if\\r\\nyou would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send it\\r\\nto you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receiving\\r\\nit from him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe read me what she had written; and it was direct and clear, and\\r\\nevidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the\\r\\nreceipt of the money. I took the tablets from her hand, and it trembled\\r\\nagain, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the\\r\\npencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she did without\\r\\nlooking at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my name, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nforgive her,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do\\r\\nit!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO Miss Havisham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI can do it now. There have been sore\\r\\nmistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want\\r\\nforgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it,\\r\\nand, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her knees\\r\\nat my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which,\\r\\nwhen her poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have\\r\\nbeen raised to heaven from her mother's side.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet\\r\\ngave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her to rise, and got\\r\\nmy arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that hand of mine\\r\\nwhich was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it and wept. I\\r\\nhad never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope that the\\r\\nrelief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking. She was not\\r\\nkneeling now, but was down upon the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she cried, despairingly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat have I done! What have I done!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me\\r\\nanswer. Very little. I should have loved her under any circumstances. Is\\r\\nshe married?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house\\r\\nhad told me so.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat have I done! What have I done!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She wrung her hands, and crushed\\r\\nher white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat have\\r\\nI done!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her. That she had done a\\r\\ngrievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form\\r\\nthat her wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found\\r\\nvengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in shutting out the light\\r\\nof day, she had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she had\\r\\nsecluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that,\\r\\nher mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and\\r\\nmust and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew\\r\\nequally well. And could I look upon her without compassion, seeing her\\r\\npunishment in the ruin she was, in her profound unfitness for this earth\\r\\non which she was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become a\\r\\nmaster mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse, the\\r\\nvanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been\\r\\ncurses in this world?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUntil you spoke to her the other day, and until I saw in you a\\r\\nlooking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know\\r\\nwhat I had done. What have I done! What have I done!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And so again,\\r\\ntwenty, fifty times over, What had she done!\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss Havisham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I said, when her cry had died away, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou may dismiss me\\r\\nfrom your mind and conscience. But Estella is a different case, and if\\r\\nyou can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a\\r\\npart of her right nature away from her, it will be better to do that\\r\\nthan to bemoan the past through a hundred years.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, I know it. But, Pip--my dear!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d There was an earnest womanly\\r\\ncompassion for me in her new affection. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear! Believe this: when she\\r\\nfirst came to me, I meant to save her from misery like my own. At first,\\r\\nI meant no more.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, well!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI hope so.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did\\r\\nworse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings,\\r\\nand with this figure of myself always before her, a warning to back and\\r\\npoint my lessons, I stole her heart away, and put ice in its place.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBetter,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I could not help saying, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto have left her a natural heart,\\r\\neven to be bruised or broken.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, and then\\r\\nburst out again, What had she done!\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you knew all my story,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she pleaded, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou would have some compassion\\r\\nfor me and a better understanding of me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss Havisham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I answered, as delicately as I could, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI believe I may\\r\\nsay that I do know your story, and have known it ever since I first left\\r\\nthis neighborhood. It has inspired me with great commiseration, and I\\r\\nhope I understand it and its influences. Does what has passed between us\\r\\ngive me any excuse for asking you a question relative to Estella? Not as\\r\\nshe is, but as she was when she first came here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was seated on the ground, with her arms on the ragged chair, and\\r\\nher head leaning on them. She looked full at me when I said this, and\\r\\nreplied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGo on.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhose child was Estella?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou don't know?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut Mr. Jaggers brought her here, or sent her here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBrought her here.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWill you tell me how that came about?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe answered in a low whisper and with caution: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI had been shut up in\\r\\nthese rooms a long time (I don't know how long; you know what time the\\r\\nclocks keep here), when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rear\\r\\nand love, and save from my fate. I had first seen him when I sent\\r\\nfor him to lay this place waste for me; having read of him in the\\r\\nnewspapers, before I and the world parted. He told me that he would\\r\\nlook about him for such an orphan child. One night he brought her here\\r\\nasleep, and I called her Estella.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMight I ask her age then?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTwo or three. She herself knows nothing, but that she was left an\\r\\norphan and I adopted her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo convinced I was of that woman's being her mother, that I wanted\\r\\nno evidence to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any mind, I\\r\\nthought, the connection here was clear and straight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I had\\r\\nsucceeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she knew\\r\\nof Estella, I had said and done what I could to ease her mind. No matter\\r\\nwith what other words we parted; we parted.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air. I\\r\\ncalled to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that I would\\r\\nnot trouble her just yet, but would walk round the place before leaving.\\r\\nFor I had a presentiment that I should never be there again, and I felt\\r\\nthat the dying light was suited to my last view of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on which\\r\\nthe rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, and\\r\\nleaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on\\r\\nend, I made my way to the ruined garden. I went all round it; round by\\r\\nthe corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by the paths\\r\\nwhere Estella and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so dreary all!\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little\\r\\ndoor at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out at the\\r\\nopposite door,--not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started and\\r\\nswelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was encumbered\\r\\nwith a growth of fungus,--when I turned my head to look back. A childish\\r\\nassociation revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight\\r\\naction, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to the beam. So\\r\\nstrong was the impression, that I stood under the beam shuddering from\\r\\nhead to foot before I knew it was a fancy,--though to be sure I was\\r\\nthere in an instant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of\\r\\nthis illusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an\\r\\nindescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I\\r\\nhad once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart. Passing on into\\r\\nthe front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out\\r\\nat the locked gate of which she had the key, or first to go upstairs\\r\\nand assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I had left\\r\\nher. I took the latter course and went up.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated in the\\r\\nragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her back towards\\r\\nme. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly away,\\r\\nI saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I saw her\\r\\nrunning at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about her,\\r\\nand soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat.\\r\\nThat I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them over\\r\\nher; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose,\\r\\nand with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst, and\\r\\nall the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the ground\\r\\nstruggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered her,\\r\\nthe more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,--that this\\r\\noccurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or\\r\\nthought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the\\r\\nfloor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were\\r\\nfloating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded\\r\\nbridal dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running\\r\\naway over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries\\r\\nat the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, like\\r\\na prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or\\r\\nwhy we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that the flames\\r\\nwere out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments\\r\\nno longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was insensible, and I was afraid to have her moved, or even\\r\\ntouched. Assistance was sent for, and I held her until it came, as if\\r\\nI unreasonably fancied (I think I did) that, if I let her go, the fire\\r\\nwould break out again and consume her. When I got up, on the surgeon's\\r\\ncoming to her with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my hands\\r\\nwere burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts,\\r\\nbut that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay\\r\\nmainly in the nervous shock. By the surgeon's directions, her bed was\\r\\ncarried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened to\\r\\nbe well suited to the dressing of her injuries. When I saw her again, an\\r\\nhour afterwards, she lay, indeed, where I had seen her strike her stick,\\r\\nand had heard her say that she would lie one day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough every vestige of her dress was burnt, as they told me, she\\r\\nstill had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they had\\r\\ncovered her to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she lay with\\r\\na white sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that\\r\\nhad been and was changed was still upon her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and I\\r\\ngot a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the\\r\\nnext post. Miss Havisham's family I took upon myself; intending to\\r\\ncommunicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him to do as he\\r\\nliked about informing the rest. This I did next day, through Herbert, as\\r\\nsoon as I returned to town.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of what had\\r\\nhappened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight she\\r\\nbegan to wander in her speech; and after that it gradually set in that\\r\\nshe said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat have I done!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n And then, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhen she first came, I meant to save her from misery like\\r\\nmine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And then, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTake the pencil and write under my name, 'I forgive\\r\\nher!'Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She never changed the order of these three sentences, but she\\r\\nsometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting in\\r\\nanother word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that pressing\\r\\nreason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could not drive\\r\\nout of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that I would\\r\\nreturn by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, and being\\r\\ntaken up clear of the town. At about six o'clock of the morning,\\r\\ntherefore, I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine, just as\\r\\nthey said, not stopping for being touched, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTake the pencil and write\\r\\nunder my name, 'I forgive her.'Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter L\\r\\n\\r\\nMy hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again in\\r\\nthe morning. My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less\\r\\nseverely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flames\\r\\nhad set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse. My right\\r\\nhand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers. It was\\r\\nbandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand and\\r\\narm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like a\\r\\ncloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck. My hair had\\r\\nbeen caught by the fire, but not my head or face.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his father, he came\\r\\nback to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to attending on me. He\\r\\nwas the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages,\\r\\nand steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready, and put them\\r\\non again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful for.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, I\\r\\nmight say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of the\\r\\nflames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell. If I\\r\\ndozed for a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havisham's cries, and by her\\r\\nrunning at me with all that height of fire above her head. This pain\\r\\nof the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I\\r\\nsuffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did his utmost to hold my attention\\r\\nengaged.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it. That\\r\\nwas made apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and by our\\r\\nagreeing--without agreement--to make my recovery of the use of my hands\\r\\na question of so many hours, not of so many weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy first question when I saw Herbert had been of course, whether all\\r\\nwas well down the river? As he replied in the affirmative, with perfect\\r\\nconfidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject until the day\\r\\nwas wearing away. But then, as Herbert changed the bandages, more by\\r\\nthe light of the fire than by the outer light, he went back to it\\r\\nspontaneously.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhere was Clara?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear little thing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe was up and down with\\r\\nGruffandgrim all the evening. He was perpetually pegging at the floor\\r\\nthe moment she left his sight. I doubt if he can hold out long, though.\\r\\nWhat with rum and pepper,--and pepper and rum,--I should think his\\r\\npegging must be nearly over.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd then you will be married, Herbert?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow can I take care of the dear child otherwise?--Lay your arm out upon\\r\\nthe back of the sofa, my dear boy, and I'll sit down here, and get the\\r\\nbandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes. I was\\r\\nspeaking of Provis. Do you know, Handel, he improves?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo you did. And so he is. He was very communicative last night, and\\r\\ntold me more of his life. You remember his breaking off here about some\\r\\nwoman that he had had great trouble with.--Did I hurt you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had started, but not under his touch. His words had given me a start.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI had forgotten that, Herbert, but I remember it now you speak of it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell! He went into that part of his life, and a dark wild part it is.\\r\\nShall I tell you? Or would it worry you just now?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTell me by all means. Every word.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert bent forward to look at me more nearly, as if my reply had been\\r\\nrather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYour\\r\\nhead is cool?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, touching it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cQuite,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTell me what Provis said, my dear Herbert.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt seems,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9c--there's a bandage off most charmingly, and\\r\\nnow comes the cool one,--makes you shrink at first, my poor dear fellow,\\r\\ndon't it? but it will be comfortable presently,--it seems that the\\r\\nwoman was a young woman, and a jealous woman, and a revengeful woman;\\r\\nrevengeful, Handel, to the last degree.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTo what last degree?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMurder.--Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't feel it. How did she murder? Whom did she murder?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut, she was tried for it, and Mr. Jaggers defended\\r\\nher, and the reputation of that defence first made his name known\\r\\nto Provis. It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim,\\r\\nand there had been a struggle--in a barn. Who began it, or how fair\\r\\nit was, or how unfair, may be doubtful; but how it ended is\\r\\ncertainly not doubtful, for the victim was found throttled.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWas the woman brought in guilty?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo; she was acquitted.--My poor Handel, I hurt you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt is impossible to be gentler, Herbert. Yes? What else?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child; a little\\r\\nchild of whom Provis was exceedingly fond. On the evening of the very\\r\\nnight when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the\\r\\nyoung woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and swore\\r\\nthat she would destroy the child (which was in her possession), and he\\r\\nshould never see it again; then she vanished.--There's the worst arm\\r\\ncomfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the right\\r\\nhand, which is a far easier job. I can do it better by this light\\r\\nthan by a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I don't see the poor\\r\\nblistered patches too distinctly.--You don't think your breathing is\\r\\naffected, my dear boy? You seem to breathe quickly.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I do, Herbert. Did the woman keep her oath?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere comes the darkest part of Provis's life. She did.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat is, he says she did.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, of course, my dear boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise,\\r\\nand again bending forward to get a nearer look at me. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe says it all. I\\r\\nhave no other information.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, to be sure.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, whether,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pursued Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9che had used the child's mother ill, or\\r\\nwhether he had used the child's mother well, Provis doesn't say; but she\\r\\nhad shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described\\r\\nto us at this fireside, and he seems to have felt pity for her, and\\r\\nforbearance towards her. Therefore, fearing he should be called upon to\\r\\ndepose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause of her death, he\\r\\nhid himself (much as he grieved for the child), kept himself dark, as he\\r\\nsays, out of the way and out of the trial, and was only vaguely talked\\r\\nof as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the jealousy arose. After\\r\\nthe acquittal she disappeared, and thus he lost the child and the\\r\\nchild's mother.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI want to ask--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA moment, my dear boy, and I have done. That evil genius, Compeyson,\\r\\nthe worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels, knowing of his keeping\\r\\nout of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so, of course\\r\\nafterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him\\r\\npoorer and working him harder. It was clear last night that this barbed\\r\\nthe point of Provis's animosity.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI want to know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand particularly, Herbert, whether he told\\r\\nyou when this happened?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cParticularly? Let me remember, then, what he said as to that. His\\r\\nexpression was, 'a round score o' year ago, and a'most directly after I\\r\\ntook up wi' Compeyson.' How old were you when you came upon him in the\\r\\nlittle churchyard?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think in my seventh year.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAy. It had happened some three or four years then, he said, and you\\r\\nbrought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost, who would have\\r\\nbeen about your age.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHerbert,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccan you see\\r\\nme best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBy the firelight,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d answered Herbert, coming close again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLook at me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI do look at you, my dear boy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTouch me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI do touch you, my dear boy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are not afraid that I am in any fever, or that my head is much\\r\\ndisordered by the accident of last night?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cN-no, my dear boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, after taking time to examine me. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\nare rather excited, but you are quite yourself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI know I am quite myself. And the man we have in hiding down the river,\\r\\nis Estella's Father.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LI\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving\\r\\nEstella's parentage, I cannot say. It will presently be seen that the\\r\\nquestion was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before\\r\\nme by a wiser head than my own.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I was seized\\r\\nwith a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter down,--that I\\r\\nought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr. Jaggers, and come\\r\\nat the bare truth. I really do not know whether I felt that I did this\\r\\nfor Estella's sake, or whether I was glad to transfer to the man in\\r\\nwhose preservation I was so much concerned some rays of the romantic\\r\\ninterest that had so long surrounded me. Perhaps the latter possibility\\r\\nmay be the nearer to the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street\\r\\nthat night. Herbert's representations that, if I did, I should probably\\r\\nbe laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive's safety would depend\\r\\nupon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the understanding, again\\r\\nand again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr. Jaggers\\r\\nto-morrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my hurts\\r\\nlooked after, and to stay at home. Early next morning we went out\\r\\ntogether, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I left\\r\\nHerbert to go his way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went over\\r\\nthe office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things\\r\\nstraight. On these occasions, Wemmick took his books and papers into Mr.\\r\\nJaggers's room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer\\r\\noffice. Finding such clerk on Wemmick's post that morning, I knew\\r\\nwhat was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick\\r\\ntogether, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to\\r\\ncompromise him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders,\\r\\nfavored my object. Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a brief account of\\r\\nthe accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to give him all\\r\\nthe details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk\\r\\nto be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the rules of\\r\\nevidence, than it had been before. While I described the disaster, Mr.\\r\\nJaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire. Wemmick leaned\\r\\nback in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in the pockets of his\\r\\ntrousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post. The two brutal\\r\\ncasts, always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings,\\r\\nseemed to be congestively considering whether they didn't smell fire at\\r\\nthe present moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced\\r\\nMiss Havisham's authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for\\r\\nHerbert. Mr. Jaggers's eyes retired a little deeper into his head when\\r\\nI handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick,\\r\\nwith instructions to draw the check for his signature. While that was\\r\\nin course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr.\\r\\nJaggers, poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots, looked\\r\\non at me. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am sorry, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, as I put the check in my pocket,\\r\\nwhen he had signed it, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat we do nothing for you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss Havisham was good enough to ask me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I returned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhether she\\r\\ncould do nothing for me, and I told her No.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEverybody should know his own business,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. And I saw\\r\\nWemmick's lips form the words Ã¢\\x80\\x9cportable property.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should not have told her No, if I had been you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr Jaggers;\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cbut every man ought to know his own business best.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEvery man's business,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cis portable property.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at\\r\\nheart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked her to give\\r\\nme some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gave me\\r\\nall she possessed.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid she?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots and\\r\\nthen straightening himself. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHah! I don't think I should have done so,\\r\\nif I had been Miss Havisham. But she ought to know her own business\\r\\nbest.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI know more of the history of Miss Havisham's adopted child than Miss\\r\\nHavisham herself does, sir. I know her mother.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMother?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have seen her mother within these three days.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd so have you, sir. And you have seen her still more recently.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I know more of Estella's history than even you do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nknow her father too.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his manner--he was too\\r\\nself-possessed to change his manner, but he could not help its being\\r\\nbrought to an indefinably attentive stop--assured me that he did not\\r\\nknow who her father was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis's\\r\\naccount (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark;\\r\\nwhich I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers's\\r\\nclient until some four years later, and when he could have no reason for\\r\\nclaiming his identity. But, I could not be sure of this unconsciousness\\r\\non Mr. Jaggers's part before, though I was quite sure of it now.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo! You know the young lady's father, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I replied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand his name is Provis--from New South Wales.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEven Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest\\r\\nstart that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the\\r\\nsooner checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the\\r\\naction of taking out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the\\r\\nannouncement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him just\\r\\nthen, lest Mr. Jaggers's sharpness should detect that there had been\\r\\nsome communication unknown to him between us.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd on what evidence, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he\\r\\npaused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdoes Provis make\\r\\nthis claim?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe does not make it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand has never made it, and has no\\r\\nknowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so\\r\\nunexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket\\r\\nwithout completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked\\r\\nwith stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation\\r\\nthat I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact\\r\\nknew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look\\r\\ntowards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been for\\r\\nsome time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers's look. When I did at last turn\\r\\nmy eyes in Wemmick's direction, I found that he had unposted his pen,\\r\\nand was intent upon the table before him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHah!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on the\\r\\ntable. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a\\r\\npassionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank and\\r\\nmanly with me. I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had\\r\\nlapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had\\r\\nmade: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I\\r\\nrepresented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from\\r\\nhim, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said that\\r\\nI did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted\\r\\nassurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,\\r\\nand why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he\\r\\ncared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,\\r\\nand that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,\\r\\nwhatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything\\r\\nelse in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and\\r\\nsilent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to\\r\\nWemmick, and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle\\r\\nheart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the\\r\\ninnocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business\\r\\nlife. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to\\r\\nrepresent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to be more\\r\\nopen with me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr.\\r\\nJaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving\\r\\ncrossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his\\r\\nemployment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something like\\r\\na smile, and Wemmick become bolder.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat's all this?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou with an old father, and you\\r\\nwith pleasant and playful ways?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf I don't bring 'em here, what does it\\r\\nmatter?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling\\r\\nopenly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthis man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot a bit of it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think\\r\\nyou're another.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still\\r\\ndistrustful that the other was taking him in.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou with a pleasant home?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSince it don't interfere with business,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9clet it be\\r\\nso. Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn't wonder if you might be planning\\r\\nand contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days,\\r\\nwhen you're tired of all this work.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and\\r\\nactually drew a sigh. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe won't talk about 'poor\\r\\ndreams;' you know more about such things than I, having much fresher\\r\\nexperience of that kind. But now about this other matter. I'll put a\\r\\ncase to you. Mind! I admit nothing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly\\r\\nsaid that he admitted nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cput this case. Put the case that a\\r\\nwoman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child\\r\\nconcealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser,\\r\\non his representing to her that he must know, with an eye to the\\r\\nlatitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child. Put the\\r\\ncase that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an\\r\\neccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI follow you, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPut the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he\\r\\nsaw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain\\r\\ndestruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at\\r\\na criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that\\r\\nhe habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported,\\r\\nneglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing\\r\\nup to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw\\r\\nin his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much\\r\\nspawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to his net,--to be\\r\\nprosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI follow you, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPut the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the\\r\\nheap who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make\\r\\nno stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this\\r\\npower: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so, you\\r\\ndid such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you through\\r\\nit all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it should\\r\\nbe necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be produced.\\r\\nGive the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring you off. If\\r\\nyou are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost, your child is\\r\\nstill saved.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Put the case that this was done, and that the woman was\\r\\ncleared.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI understand you perfectly.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut that I make no admissions?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat you make no admissions.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And Wemmick repeated, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo admissions.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPut the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little\\r\\nshaken the woman's intellects, and that when she was set at liberty,\\r\\nshe was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to him to be\\r\\nsheltered. Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the\\r\\nold, wild, violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking\\r\\nout, by asserting his power over her in the old way. Do you comprehend\\r\\nthe imaginary case?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cQuite.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPut the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That\\r\\nthe mother was still living. That the father was still living. That the\\r\\nmother and father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many\\r\\nmiles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was\\r\\nstill a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case\\r\\nto yourself very carefully.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI ask Wemmick to put it to himself very carefully.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Wemmick said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFor whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father's? I think\\r\\nhe would not be much the better for the mother. For the mother's? I\\r\\nthink if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was.\\r\\nFor the daughter's? I think it would hardly serve her to establish her\\r\\nparentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back to\\r\\ndisgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for\\r\\nlife. But add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made her the\\r\\nsubject of those 'poor dreams' which have, at one time or another, been\\r\\nin the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you that you\\r\\nhad better--and would much sooner when you had thought well of it--chop\\r\\noff that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand, and\\r\\nthen pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut that off too.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely touched his\\r\\nlips with his forefinger. I did the same. Mr. Jaggers did the same.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Wemmick,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat\\r\\nitem was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nStanding by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the\\r\\nodd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times: with\\r\\nthis difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to say\\r\\nconscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to\\r\\nthe other. For this reason, I suppose, they were now inflexible with one\\r\\nanother; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and Wemmick obstinately\\r\\njustifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for\\r\\na moment. I had never seen them on such ill terms; for generally they\\r\\ngot on very well indeed together.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of Mike,\\r\\nthe client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his\\r\\nsleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance within\\r\\nthose walls. This individual, who, either in his own person or in that\\r\\nof some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble (which in\\r\\nthat place meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldest daughter\\r\\nwas taken up on suspicion of shoplifting. As he imparted this melancholy\\r\\ncircumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially before the\\r\\nfire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike's eye happened to\\r\\ntwinkle with a tear.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat are you about?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you come snivelling here for?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI didn't go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou did,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow dare you? You're not in a fit state to\\r\\ncome here, if you can't come here without spluttering like a bad pen.\\r\\nWhat do you mean by it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA man can't help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pleaded Mike.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHis what?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSay that again!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow look here my man,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, and pointing\\r\\nto the door. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGet out of this office. I'll have no feelings here. Get\\r\\nout.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt serves you right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGet out.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and\\r\\nWemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and\\r\\nwent to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had\\r\\njust had lunch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Little Britain I went, with my check in my pocket, to Miss\\r\\nSkiffins's brother, the accountant; and Miss Skiffins's brother, the\\r\\naccountant, going straight to Clarriker's and bringing Clarriker to me,\\r\\nI had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement. It was the\\r\\nonly good thing I had done, and the only completed thing I had done,\\r\\nsince I was first apprised of my great expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nClarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the House\\r\\nwere steadily progressing, that he would now be able to establish a\\r\\nsmall branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the extension\\r\\nof the business, and that Herbert in his new partnership capacity would\\r\\ngo out and take charge of it, I found that I must have prepared for\\r\\na separation from my friend, even though my own affairs had been more\\r\\nsettled. And now, indeed, I felt as if my last anchor were loosening its\\r\\nhold, and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come home\\r\\nof a night and tell me of these changes, little imagining that he told\\r\\nme no news, and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting Clara\\r\\nBarley to the land of the Arabian Nights, and of me going out to join\\r\\nthem (with a caravan of camels, I believe), and of our all going up the\\r\\nNile and seeing wonders. Without being sanguine as to my own part in\\r\\nthose bright plans, I felt that Herbert's way was clearing fast, and\\r\\nthat old Bill Barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum, and his\\r\\ndaughter would soon be happily provided for.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had now got into the month of March. My left arm, though it presented\\r\\nno bad symptoms, took, in the natural course, so long to heal that I\\r\\nwas still unable to get a coat on. My right arm was tolerably restored;\\r\\ndisfigured, but fairly serviceable.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a Monday morning, when Herbert and I were at breakfast, I received\\r\\nthe following letter from Wemmick by the post.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWalworth. Burn this as soon as read. Early in the week, or say\\r\\nWednesday, you might do what you know of, if you felt disposed to try\\r\\nit. Now burn.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire--but not\\r\\nbefore we had both got it by heart--we considered what to do. For, of\\r\\ncourse my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have thought it over again and again,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I think I\\r\\nknow a better course than taking a Thames waterman. Take Startop. A good\\r\\nfellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic and honorable.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had thought of him more than once.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut how much would you tell him, Herbert?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt is necessary to tell him very little. Let him suppose it a mere\\r\\nfreak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him know that\\r\\nthere is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away. You go\\r\\nwith him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo doubt.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhere?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the\\r\\npoint, almost indifferent what port we made for,--Hamburg, Rotterdam,\\r\\nAntwerp,--the place signified little, so that he was out of England. Any\\r\\nforeign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do.\\r\\nI had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the\\r\\nboat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for\\r\\nsearch or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers would\\r\\nleave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get\\r\\ndown the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot\\r\\nuntil we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where we\\r\\nlay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we\\r\\nmade inquiries beforehand.\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after\\r\\nbreakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer for\\r\\nHamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our\\r\\nthoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign\\r\\nsteamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied\\r\\nourselves that we knew the build and color of each. We then separated\\r\\nfor a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary;\\r\\nHerbert, to see Startop at his lodgings. We both did what we had to do\\r\\nwithout any hindrance, and when we met again at one o'clock reported\\r\\nit done. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen\\r\\nStartop, and he was more than ready to join.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer; our\\r\\ncharge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our object, we\\r\\nshould make way enough. We arranged that Herbert should not come home to\\r\\ndinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that he should\\r\\nnot go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he should prepare\\r\\nProvis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on Wednesday, when\\r\\nhe saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the arrangements with\\r\\nhim should be concluded that Monday night; and that he should be\\r\\ncommunicated with no more in any way, until we took him on board.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese precautions well understood by both of us, I went home.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn opening the outer door of our chambers with my key, I found a letter\\r\\nin the box, directed to me; a very dirty letter, though not ill-written.\\r\\nIt had been delivered by hand (of course, since I left home), and its\\r\\ncontents were these:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to-night or to-morrow\\r\\nnight at nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln,\\r\\nyou had better come. If you want information regarding your uncle\\r\\nProvis, you had much better come and tell no one, and lose no time. You\\r\\nmust come alone. Bring this with you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange\\r\\nletter. What to do now, I could not tell. And the worst was, that I must\\r\\ndecide quickly, or I should miss the afternoon coach, which would take\\r\\nme down in time for to-night. To-morrow night I could not think of\\r\\ngoing, for it would be too close upon the time of the flight. And again,\\r\\nfor anything I knew, the proffered information might have some important\\r\\nbearing on the flight itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should still have\\r\\ngone. Having hardly any time for consideration,--my watch showing me\\r\\nthat the coach started within half an hour,--I resolved to go. I should\\r\\ncertainly not have gone, but for the reference to my Uncle Provis. That,\\r\\ncoming on Wemmick's letter and the morning's busy preparation, turned\\r\\nthe scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost\\r\\nany letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read this mysterious\\r\\nepistle again twice, before its injunction to me to be secret got\\r\\nmechanically into my mind. Yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of\\r\\nway, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling him that as I should\\r\\nbe so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I had decided to hurry\\r\\ndown and back, to ascertain for myself how Miss Havisham was faring.\\r\\nI had then barely time to get my great-coat, lock up the chambers,\\r\\nand make for the coach-office by the short by-ways. If I had taken a\\r\\nhackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should have missed my aim;\\r\\ngoing as I did, I caught the coach just as it came out of the yard. I\\r\\nwas the only inside passenger, jolting away knee-deep in straw, when I\\r\\ncame to myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; it had\\r\\nso bewildered me, ensuing on the hurry of the morning. The morning hurry\\r\\nand flutter had been great; for, long and anxiously as I had waited for\\r\\nWemmick, his hint had come like a surprise at last. And now I began\\r\\nto wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubt whether I had\\r\\nsufficient reason for being there, and to consider whether I should\\r\\nget out presently and go back, and to argue against ever heeding an\\r\\nanonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through all those phases\\r\\nof contradiction and indecision to which I suppose very few hurried\\r\\npeople are strangers. Still, the reference to Provis by name mastered\\r\\neverything. I reasoned as I had reasoned already without knowing it,--if\\r\\nthat be reasoning,--in case any harm should befall him through my not\\r\\ngoing, how could I ever forgive myself!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and dreary\\r\\nto me, who could see little of it inside, and who could not go outside\\r\\nin my disabled state. Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an inn of\\r\\nminor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner. While it was\\r\\npreparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham; she was\\r\\nstill very ill, though considered something better.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I\\r\\ndined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font. As I was not able\\r\\nto cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for\\r\\nme. This bringing us into conversation, he was so good as to entertain\\r\\nme with my own story,--of course with the popular feature that\\r\\nPumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you know the young man?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKnow him!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d repeated the landlord. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cEver since he was--no height at\\r\\nall.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDoes he ever come back to this neighborhood?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAy, he comes back,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the landlord, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto his great friends, now and\\r\\nagain, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat man is that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHim that I speak of,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the landlord. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Pumblechook.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs he ungrateful to no one else?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo doubt he would be, if he could,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the landlord, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut he\\r\\ncan't. And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDoes Pumblechook say so?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSay so!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d replied the landlord. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe han't no call to say so.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut does he say so?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt would turn a man's blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of\\r\\nit, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the landlord.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYet Joe, dear Joe, you never tell of it. Long-suffering and\\r\\nloving Joe, you never complain. Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYour appetite's been touched like by your accident,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the landlord,\\r\\nglancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTry a tenderer bit.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, thank you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I replied, turning from the table to brood over the\\r\\nfire. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI can eat no more. Please take it away.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe, as\\r\\nthrough the brazen impostor Pumblechook. The falser he, the truer Joe;\\r\\nthe meaner he, the nobler Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the fire\\r\\nfor an hour or more. The striking of the clock aroused me, but not from\\r\\nmy dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastened round\\r\\nmy neck, and went out. I had previously sought in my pockets for the\\r\\nletter, that I might refer to it again; but I could not find it, and\\r\\nwas uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of\\r\\nthe coach. I knew very well, however, that the appointed place was the\\r\\nlittle sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes, and the hour nine.\\r\\nTowards the marshes I now went straight, having no time to spare.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LIII\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed\\r\\nlands, and passed out upon the marshes. Beyond their dark line there was\\r\\na ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon.\\r\\nIn a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field, in among the\\r\\npiled mountains of cloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal. A\\r\\nstranger would have found them insupportable, and even to me they were\\r\\nso oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back. But I knew\\r\\nthem well, and could have found my way on a far darker night, and had\\r\\nno excuse for returning, being there. So, having come there against my\\r\\ninclination, I went on against it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, nor\\r\\nthat in which we had pursued the convicts. My back was turned towards\\r\\nthe distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the old lights\\r\\naway on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder. I knew the\\r\\nlimekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were miles apart;\\r\\nso that, if a light had been burning at each point that night, there\\r\\nwould have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright\\r\\nspecks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to stand\\r\\nstill while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose\\r\\nand blundered down among the grass and reeds. But after a little while I\\r\\nseemed to have the whole flats to myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln. The lime was\\r\\nburning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up and\\r\\nleft, and no workmen were visible. Hard by was a small stone-quarry. It\\r\\nlay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the\\r\\ntools and barrows that were lying about.\\r\\n\\r\\nComing up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,--for the rude\\r\\npath lay through it,--I saw a light in the old sluice-house. I quickened\\r\\nmy pace, and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting for some reply,\\r\\nI looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken, and\\r\\nhow the house--of wood with a tiled roof--would not be proof against the\\r\\nweather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and ooze\\r\\nwere coated with lime, and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a\\r\\nghostly way towards me. Still there was no answer, and I knocked again.\\r\\nNo answer still, and I tried the latch.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt rose under my hand, and the door yielded. Looking in, I saw a lighted\\r\\ncandle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle bedstead. As\\r\\nthere was a loft above, I called, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIs there any one here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but no voice\\r\\nanswered. Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that it was past nine,\\r\\ncalled again, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIs there any one here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d There being still no answer, I\\r\\nwent out at the door, irresolute what to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was beginning to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seen\\r\\nalready, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the shelter\\r\\nof the doorway, looking out into the night. While I was considering that\\r\\nsome one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back, or\\r\\nthe candle would not be burning, it came into my head to look if the\\r\\nwick were long. I turned round to do so, and had taken up the candle in\\r\\nmy hand, when it was extinguished by some violent shock; and the next\\r\\nthing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in a strong running\\r\\nnoose, thrown over my head from behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said a suppressed voice with an oath, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI've got you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is this?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I cried, struggling. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWho is it? Help, help, help!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on\\r\\nmy bad arm caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong man's hand,\\r\\nsometimes a strong man's breast, was set against my mouth to deaden\\r\\nmy cries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled\\r\\nineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd\\r\\nnow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the suppressed voice with another oath, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccall out again, and\\r\\nI'll make short work of you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFaint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the\\r\\nsurprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in\\r\\nexecution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little.\\r\\nBut, it was bound too tight for that. I felt as if, having been burnt\\r\\nbefore, it were now being boiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black\\r\\ndarkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.\\r\\nAfter groping about for a little, he found the flint and steel he\\r\\nwanted, and began to strike a light. I strained my sight upon the sparks\\r\\nthat fell among the tinder, and upon which he breathed and breathed,\\r\\nmatch in hand, but I could only see his lips, and the blue point of\\r\\nthe match; even those but fitfully. The tinder was damp,--no wonder\\r\\nthere,--and one after another the sparks died out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel. As\\r\\nthe sparks fell thick and bright about him, I could see his hands, and\\r\\ntouches of his face, and could make out that he was seated and bending\\r\\nover the table; but nothing more. Presently I saw his blue lips again,\\r\\nbreathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and\\r\\nshowed me Orlick.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhom I had looked for, I don't know. I had not looked for him. Seeing\\r\\nhim, I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes\\r\\nupon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation,\\r\\nand dropped the match, and trod it out. Then he put the candle away from\\r\\nhim on the table, so that he could see me, and sat with his arms folded\\r\\non the table and looked at me. I made out that I was fastened to a stout\\r\\nperpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall,--a fixture there,--the\\r\\nmeans of ascent to the loft above.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, when we had surveyed one another for some time, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI've\\r\\ngot you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUnbind me. Let me go!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'll let you go. I'll let you go to the moon, I'll\\r\\nlet you go to the stars. All in good time.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy have you lured me here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDon't you know?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, with a deadly look.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy have you set upon me in the dark?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better than two.\\r\\nO you enemy, you enemy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he sat with his arms\\r\\nfolded on the table, shaking his head at me and hugging himself, had a\\r\\nmalignity in it that made me tremble. As I watched him in silence,\\r\\nhe put his hand into the corner at his side, and took up a gun with a\\r\\nbrass-bound stock.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you know this?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, making as if he would take aim at me. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo\\r\\nyou know where you saw it afore? Speak, wolf!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou cost me that place. You did. Speak!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat else could I do?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou did that, and that would be enough, without more. How dared you to\\r\\ncome betwixt me and a young woman I liked?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen did I?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen didn't you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to\\r\\nher.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself. I could have done\\r\\nyou no harm, if you had done yourself none.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou're a liar. And you'll take any pains, and spend any money, to drive\\r\\nme out of this country, will you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, repeating my words to Biddy\\r\\nin the last interview I had with her. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow, I'll tell you a piece of\\r\\ninformation. It was never so well worth your while to get me out of this\\r\\ncountry as it is to-night. Ah! If it was all your money twenty times\\r\\ntold, to the last brass farden!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d As he shook his heavy hand at me, with\\r\\nhis mouth snarling like a tiger's, I felt that it was true.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat are you going to do to me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI'm a going,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with a\\r\\nheavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'm\\r\\na going to have your life!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his hand and drew it\\r\\nacross his mouth as if his mouth watered for me, and sat down again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou was always in Old Orlick's way since ever you was a child. You goes\\r\\nout of his way this present night. He'll have no more on you. You're\\r\\ndead.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I looked\\r\\nwildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMore than that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, folding his arms on the table again, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI won't\\r\\nhave a rag of you, I won't have a bone of you, left on earth. I'll put\\r\\nyour body in the kiln,--I'd carry two such to it, on my Shoulders,--and,\\r\\nlet people suppose what they may of you, they shall never know nothing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mind, with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences\\r\\nof such a death. Estella's father would believe I had deserted him,\\r\\nwould be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me,\\r\\nwhen he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had\\r\\ncalled at Miss Havisham's gate for only a moment; Joe and Biddy would\\r\\nnever know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what\\r\\nI had suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed\\r\\nthrough. The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible\\r\\nthan death was the dread of being misremembered after death. And\\r\\nso quick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn\\r\\ngenerations,--Estella's children, and their children,--while the\\r\\nwretch's words were yet on his lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, wolf,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cafore I kill you like any other beast,--which is\\r\\nwot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,--I'll have a good look\\r\\nat you and a good goad at you. O you enemy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though\\r\\nfew could know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and the\\r\\nhopelessness of aid. But as he sat gloating over me, I was supported by\\r\\na scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips. Above all things, I\\r\\nresolved that I would not entreat him, and that I would die making some\\r\\nlast poor resistance to him. Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of\\r\\nmen were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of\\r\\nHeaven; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no\\r\\nfarewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to\\r\\nme, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my\\r\\nmiserable errors,--still, if I could have killed him, even in dying, I\\r\\nwould have done it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been drinking, and his eyes were red and bloodshot. Around his\\r\\nneck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen his meat and drink\\r\\nslung about him in other days. He brought the bottle to his lips, and\\r\\ntook a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw\\r\\nflash into his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWolf!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, folding his arms again, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOld Orlick's a going to tell\\r\\nyou somethink. It was you as did for your shrew sister.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted the\\r\\nwhole subject of the attack upon my sister, her illness, and her death,\\r\\nbefore his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt was you, villain,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI tell you it was your doing,--I tell you it was done through you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nretorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the\\r\\nvacant air between us. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI come upon her from behind, as I come upon you\\r\\nto-night. I giv' it her! I left her for dead, and if there had been a\\r\\nlimekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you, she shouldn't have come\\r\\nto life again. But it warn't Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You was\\r\\nfavored, and he was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?\\r\\nNow you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by his tilting of\\r\\nthe bottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly\\r\\nunderstood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an\\r\\nend of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knew\\r\\nthat when I was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards\\r\\nme but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, he would do\\r\\nas he had done in my sister's case,--make all haste to the town, and\\r\\nbe seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses. My rapid mind\\r\\npursued him to the town, made a picture of the street with him in it,\\r\\nand contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white\\r\\nvapor creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years\\r\\nwhile he said a dozen words, but that what he did say presented pictures\\r\\nto me, and not mere words. In the excited and exalted state of my brain,\\r\\nI could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons without\\r\\nseeing them. It is impossible to overstate the vividness of these\\r\\nimages, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon him himself,--who\\r\\nwould not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring!--that I knew of\\r\\nthe slightest action of his fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had drunk this second time, he rose from the bench on which\\r\\nhe sat, and pushed the table aside. Then, he took up the candle, and,\\r\\nshading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me, stood\\r\\nbefore me, looking at me and enjoying the sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWolf, I'll tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you tumbled\\r\\nover on your stairs that night.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows of\\r\\nthe heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchman's lantern on the wall.\\r\\nI saw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open;\\r\\nthere, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd why was Old Orlick there? I'll tell you something more, wolf.\\r\\nYou and her have pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as\\r\\ngetting a easy living in it goes, and I've took up with new companions,\\r\\nand new masters. Some of 'em writes my letters when I wants 'em\\r\\nwrote,--do you mind?--writes my letters, wolf! They writes fifty hands;\\r\\nthey're not like sneaking you, as writes but one. I've had a firm mind\\r\\nand a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at your\\r\\nsister's burying. I han't seen a way to get you safe, and I've looked\\r\\narter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old Orlick to himself,\\r\\n'Somehow or another I'll have him!' What! When I looks for you, I finds\\r\\nyour uncle Provis, eh?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMill Pond Bank, and Chinks's Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,\\r\\nall so clear and plain! Provis in his rooms, the signal whose use was\\r\\nover, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on his\\r\\nback, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast running\\r\\nout to sea!\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou with a uncle too! Why, I know'd you at Gargery's when you was so\\r\\nsmall a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and\\r\\nthumb and chucked you away dead (as I'd thoughts o' doing, odd times,\\r\\nwhen I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you\\r\\nhadn't found no uncles then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come for\\r\\nto hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old\\r\\nOrlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year\\r\\nago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like\\r\\na bullock, as he means to drop you--hey?--when he come for to hear\\r\\nthat--hey?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his savage taunting, he flared the candle so close at me that I\\r\\nturned my face aside to save it from the flame.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he cried, laughing, after doing it again, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe burnt child dreads\\r\\nthe fire! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was\\r\\nsmuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlick's a match for you and\\r\\nknow'd you'd come to-night! Now I'll tell you something more, wolf, and\\r\\nthis ends it. There's them that's as good a match for your uncle Provis\\r\\nas Old Orlick has been for you. Let him 'ware them, when he's lost his\\r\\nnevvy! Let him 'ware them, when no man can't find a rag of his dear\\r\\nrelation's clothes, nor yet a bone of his body. There's them that can't\\r\\nand that won't have Magwitch,--yes, I know the name!--alive in the same\\r\\nland with them, and that's had such sure information of him when he\\r\\nwas alive in another land, as that he couldn't and shouldn't leave it\\r\\nunbeknown and put them in danger. P'raps it's them that writes fifty\\r\\nhands, and that's not like sneaking you as writes but one. 'Ware\\r\\nCompeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an\\r\\ninstant blinding me, and turned his powerful back as he replaced the\\r\\nlight on the table. I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and\\r\\nBiddy and Herbert, before he turned towards me again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite\\r\\nwall. Within this space, he now slouched backwards and forwards. His\\r\\ngreat strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever before, as he\\r\\ndid this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his sides, and with\\r\\nhis eyes scowling at me. I had no grain of hope left. Wild as my inward\\r\\nhurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me\\r\\ninstead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand that, unless he had\\r\\nresolved that I was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all\\r\\nhuman knowledge, he would never have told me what he had told.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf a sudden, he stopped, took the cork out of his bottle, and tossed\\r\\nit away. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He swallowed\\r\\nslowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he looked at\\r\\nme no more. The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of his\\r\\nhand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing\\r\\nhorribly, he threw the bottle from him, and stooped; and I saw in his\\r\\nhand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering\\r\\none vain word of appeal to him, I shouted out with all my might, and\\r\\nstruggled with all my might. It was only my head and my legs that I\\r\\ncould move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until\\r\\nthen unknown, that was within me. In the same instant I heard responsive\\r\\nshouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door, heard\\r\\nvoices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of men, as if\\r\\nit were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly out into the\\r\\nnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the\\r\\nsame place, with my head on some one's knee. My eyes were fixed on the\\r\\nladder against the wall, when I came to myself,--had opened on it before\\r\\nmy mind saw it,--and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I\\r\\nwas in the place where I had lost it.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who supported\\r\\nme, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came between me and it\\r\\na face. The face of Trabb's boy!\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think he's all right!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Trabb's boy, in a sober voice; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut ain't\\r\\nhe just pale though!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine,\\r\\nand I saw my supporter to be--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHerbert! Great Heaven!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSoftly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGently, Handel. Don't be too eager.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd our old comrade, Startop!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I cried, as he too bent over me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRemember what he is going to assist us in,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand be\\r\\ncalm.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain\\r\\nin my arm. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night is\\r\\nto-night? How long have I been here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d For, I had a strange and\\r\\nstrong misgiving that I had been lying there a long time--a day and a\\r\\nnight,--two days and nights,--more.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe time has not gone by. It is still Monday night.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThank God!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut\\r\\nyou can't help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can you\\r\\nstand?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, yes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing\\r\\narm.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen and\\r\\ninflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, they tore\\r\\nup their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully replaced\\r\\nit in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling\\r\\nlotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the door of the\\r\\ndark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the quarry on our\\r\\nway back. Trabb's boy--Trabb's overgrown young man now--went before us\\r\\nwith a lantern, which was the light I had seen come in at the door. But,\\r\\nthe moon was a good two hours higher than when I had last seen the sky,\\r\\nand the night, though rainy, was much lighter. The white vapor of the\\r\\nkiln was passing from us as we went by, and as I had thought a prayer\\r\\nbefore, I thought a thanksgiving now.\\r\\n\\r\\nEntreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,--which at\\r\\nfirst he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining\\r\\nquiet,--I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our\\r\\nchambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had\\r\\nmet in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I\\r\\nwas gone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the\\r\\ninconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His\\r\\nuneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an\\r\\nhour's consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who\\r\\nvolunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went\\r\\ndown. Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his\\r\\nuneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he\\r\\nresolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the\\r\\nBlue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,\\r\\nfinding neither, went on to Miss Havisham's, where they lost me.\\r\\nHereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when\\r\\nI was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh\\r\\nthemselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes. Among\\r\\nthe loungers under the Boar's archway happened to be Trabb's Boy,--true\\r\\nto his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no\\r\\nbusiness,--and Trabb's boy had seen me passing from Miss Havisham's in\\r\\nthe direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb's boy became their guide,\\r\\nand with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by the town way\\r\\nto the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went along, Herbert\\r\\nreflected, that I might, after all, have been brought there on some\\r\\ngenuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis's safety, and,\\r\\nbethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous,\\r\\nleft his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and went on by\\r\\nhimself, and stole round the house two or three times, endeavouring to\\r\\nascertain whether all was right within. As he could hear nothing but\\r\\nindistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was while my mind was so\\r\\nbusy), he even at last began to doubt whether I was there, when suddenly\\r\\nI cried out loudly, and he answered the cries, and rushed in, closely\\r\\nfollowed by the other two.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for our\\r\\nimmediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it\\r\\nwas, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such\\r\\na course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might\\r\\nbe fatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we\\r\\nrelinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the\\r\\npresent, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather\\r\\nlight of the matter to Trabb's boy; who, I am convinced, would have been\\r\\nmuch affected by disappointment, if he had known that his intervention\\r\\nsaved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb's boy was of a malignant\\r\\nnature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it was in his\\r\\nconstitution to want variety and excitement at anybody's expense. When\\r\\nwe parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemed to meet his\\r\\nviews), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of\\r\\nhim (which made no impression on him at all).\\r\\n\\r\\nWednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London\\r\\nthat night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then be\\r\\nclear away before the night's adventure began to be talked of. Herbert\\r\\ngot a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this stuff\\r\\ndropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear its pain\\r\\non the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple, and I went\\r\\nat once to bed, and lay in bed all day.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for\\r\\nto-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of\\r\\nitself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the\\r\\nmental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon\\r\\nme that to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged with such\\r\\nconsequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining\\r\\nfrom communication with him that day; yet this again increased my\\r\\nrestlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing\\r\\nthat he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell\\r\\nme so. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was\\r\\nsomething more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the fact\\r\\nhad occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days wore\\r\\non, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,\\r\\nmy overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow\\r\\nmorning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning\\r\\nhead throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to\\r\\nhigh numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew\\r\\nin prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a\\r\\nfatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to\\r\\nmyself with a start, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow it has come, and I am turning delirious!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed, and\\r\\ngave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the notion\\r\\nI had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and the\\r\\nopportunity to save him was gone. About midnight I got out of bed\\r\\nand went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for\\r\\nfour-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past. It was the last\\r\\nself-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept\\r\\nsoundly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking\\r\\nlights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a\\r\\nmarsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was\\r\\nspanned by bridges that were turning coldly gray, with here and there\\r\\nat top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along\\r\\nthe clustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the\\r\\nunusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn from\\r\\nthe river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters. From me\\r\\ntoo, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on\\r\\nthe sofa. I could not dress myself without help; but I made up the fire,\\r\\nwhich was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In good\\r\\ntime they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the sharp\\r\\nmorning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was still\\r\\nflowing towards us.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen it turns at nine o'clock,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, cheerfully, Ã¢\\x80\\x9clook out for\\r\\nus, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LIV\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind\\r\\nblows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.\\r\\nWe had our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag. Of all my worldly\\r\\npossessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the\\r\\nbag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were\\r\\nquestions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, for\\r\\nit was wholly set on Provis's safety. I only wondered for the passing\\r\\nmoment, as I stopped at the door and looked back, under what altered\\r\\ncircumstances I should next see those rooms, if ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as if\\r\\nwe were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. Of course, I had\\r\\ntaken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After\\r\\na little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two\\r\\nor three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went\\r\\non board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering. It was then about\\r\\nhigh-water,--half-past eight.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being\\r\\nwith us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,\\r\\nand row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long\\r\\nreaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is\\r\\nbroad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and\\r\\nwhere lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we could\\r\\nchoose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all night.\\r\\nThe steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would start from\\r\\nLondon at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at what time\\r\\nto expect them, according to where we were, and would hail the first;\\r\\nso that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we should have\\r\\nanother chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose\\r\\nwas so great to me that I felt it difficult to realize the condition in\\r\\nwhich I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the\\r\\nmovement on the river, and the moving river itself,--the road that ran\\r\\nwith us, seeming to sympathize with us, animate us, and encourage us\\r\\non,--freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little use\\r\\nin the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends, and\\r\\nthey rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present\\r\\nextent, and watermen's boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailing\\r\\ncolliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now;\\r\\nbut of steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part\\r\\nso many. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and\\r\\nthere that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide;\\r\\nthe navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a much\\r\\neasier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and we\\r\\nwent ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with its\\r\\noyster-boats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitor's Gate, and\\r\\nwe were in among the tiers of shipping. Here were the Leith, Aberdeen,\\r\\nand Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and looking immensely\\r\\nhigh out of the water as we passed alongside; here, were colliers by the\\r\\nscore and score, with the coal-whippers plunging off stages on deck, as\\r\\ncounterweights to measures of coal swinging up, which were then rattled\\r\\nover the side into barges; here, at her moorings was to-morrow's steamer\\r\\nfor Rotterdam, of which we took good notice; and here to-morrow's for\\r\\nHamburg, under whose bowsprit we crossed. And now I, sitting in the\\r\\nstern, could see, with a faster beating heart, Mill Pond Bank and Mill\\r\\nPond stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs he there?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot yet.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRight! He was not to come down till he saw us. Can you see his signal?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot well from here; but I think I see it.--Now I see him! Pull both.\\r\\nEasy, Herbert. Oars!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he was on board,\\r\\nand we were off again. He had a boat-cloak with him, and a black canvas\\r\\nbag; and he looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear boy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, putting his arm on my shoulder, as he took his\\r\\nseat. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFaithful dear boy, well done. Thankye, thankye!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rusty\\r\\nchain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for the\\r\\nmoment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood\\r\\nand shaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under the\\r\\nfigure-head of the John of Sunderland making a speech to the winds (as\\r\\nis done by many Johns), and the Betsy of Yarmouth with a firm formality\\r\\nof bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her head; in\\r\\nand out, hammers going in ship-builders' yards, saws going at timber,\\r\\nclashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leaky ships,\\r\\ncapstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligible sea-creatures\\r\\nroaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen, in and\\r\\nout,--out at last upon the clearer river, where the ships' boys might\\r\\ntake their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubled waters with them\\r\\nover the side, and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the stairs where we had taken him abroad, and ever since, I had\\r\\nlooked warily for any token of our being suspected. I had seen none. We\\r\\ncertainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were not either\\r\\nattended or followed by any boat. If we had been waited on by any boat,\\r\\nI should have run in to shore, and have obliged her to go on, or to\\r\\nmake her purpose evident. But we held our own without any appearance of\\r\\nmolestation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had his boat-cloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a natural part\\r\\nof the scene. It was remarkable (but perhaps the wretched life he had\\r\\nled accounted for it) that he was the least anxious of any of us. He\\r\\nwas not indifferent, for he told me that he hoped to live to see his\\r\\ngentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he was not\\r\\ndisposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he had no\\r\\nnotion of meeting danger half way. When it came upon him, he confronted\\r\\nit, but it must come before he troubled himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you knowed, dear boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said to me, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat it is to sit here\\r\\nalonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by day\\r\\nbetwixt four walls, you'd envy me. But you don't know what it is.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think I know the delights of freedom,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, shaking his head gravely. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut you don't know it equal to\\r\\nme. You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know it equal to\\r\\nme,--but I ain't a going to be low.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, he\\r\\nshould have endangered his freedom, and even his life. But I reflected\\r\\nthat perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the\\r\\nhabit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man. I\\r\\nwas not far out, since he said, after smoking a little:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t'other side the world, I\\r\\nwas always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for\\r\\nall I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could\\r\\ncome, and Magwitch could go, and nobody's head would be troubled about\\r\\nhim. They ain't so easy concerning me here, dear boy,--wouldn't be,\\r\\nleastwise, if they knowed where I was.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf all goes well,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou will be perfectly free and safe again\\r\\nwithin a few hours.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned, drawing a long breath, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI hope so.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd think so?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dipped his hand in the water over the boat's gunwale, and said,\\r\\nsmiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAy, I s'pose I think so, dear boy. We'd be puzzled to be more quiet\\r\\nand easy-going than we are at present. But--it's a flowing so soft\\r\\nand pleasant through the water, p'raps, as makes me think it--I was\\r\\na thinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the\\r\\nbottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river\\r\\nwhat I catches hold of. Nor yet we can't no more hold their tide than\\r\\nI can hold this. And it's run through my fingers and gone, you see!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n holding up his dripping hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut for your face I should think you were a little despondent,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot a bit on it, dear boy! It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of that\\r\\nthere rippling at the boat's head making a sort of a Sunday tune. Maybe\\r\\nI'm a growing a trifle old besides.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of\\r\\nface, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of\\r\\nEngland. Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been\\r\\nin constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer\\r\\ninto the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I thought he would\\r\\nbe safest where he was, and he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo you, dear boy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and quietly sat\\r\\ndown again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the\\r\\nsunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose\\r\\nnone of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By\\r\\nimperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of the\\r\\nnearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the muddy\\r\\nbanks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend. As our\\r\\ncharge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed within a boat or\\r\\ntwo's length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch the\\r\\nstream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a large\\r\\ntransport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us. And soon\\r\\nthe tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing,\\r\\nand presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were taking\\r\\nadvantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us\\r\\nin a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength of\\r\\nthe tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows and\\r\\nmudbanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her drive\\r\\nwith the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour's rest\\r\\nproved full as much as they wanted. We got ashore among some slippery\\r\\nstones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about.\\r\\nIt was like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a\\r\\ndim horizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the great\\r\\nfloating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed\\r\\nstranded and still. For now the last of the fleet of ships was round\\r\\nthe last low point we had headed; and the last green barge, straw-laden,\\r\\nwith a brown sail, had followed; and some ballast-lighters, shaped like\\r\\na child's first rude imitation of a boat, lay low in the mud; and a\\r\\nlittle squat shoal-lighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud\\r\\non stilts and crutches; and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud, and slimy\\r\\nstones stuck out of the mud, and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck\\r\\nout of the mud, and an old landing-stage and an old roofless building\\r\\nslipped into the mud, and all about us was stagnation and mud.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe pushed off again, and made what way we could. It was much harder work\\r\\nnow, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed and rowed\\r\\nuntil the sun went down. By that time the river had lifted us a little,\\r\\nso that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on the low\\r\\nlevel of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into black; and\\r\\nthere was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were the rising\\r\\ngrounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life, save here and\\r\\nthere in the foreground a melancholy gull.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,\\r\\nwould not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for clearly\\r\\nour course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find. So,\\r\\nthey plied their oars once more, and I looked out for anything like a\\r\\nhouse. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or five dull miles. It\\r\\nwas very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with her galley-fire smoking\\r\\nand flaring, looked like a comfortable home. The night was as dark by\\r\\nthis time as it would be until morning; and what light we had, seemed\\r\\nto come more from the river than the sky, as the oars in their dipping\\r\\nstruck at a few reflected stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that\\r\\nwe were followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular\\r\\nintervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or\\r\\nother of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and\\r\\nthere, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little\\r\\ncreek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them\\r\\nnervously. Sometimes, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat was that ripple?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d one of us would say in a\\r\\nlow voice. Or another, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIs that a boat yonder?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And afterwards we would\\r\\nfall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with what\\r\\nan unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran\\r\\nalongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard\\r\\nby. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light\\r\\nto be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and I\\r\\ndare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good\\r\\nfire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various\\r\\nliquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9csuch as\\r\\nthey were,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the landlord said. No other company was in the house than\\r\\nthe landlord, his wife, and a grizzled male creature, the Ã¢\\x80\\x9cJackÃ¢\\x80\\x9d of the\\r\\nlittle causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been low-water\\r\\nmark too.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came\\r\\nashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and all\\r\\nelse, and hauled her up for the night. We made a very good meal by the\\r\\nkitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startop\\r\\nwere to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found the air as\\r\\ncarefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and there\\r\\nwere more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have\\r\\nthought the family possessed. But we considered ourselves well off,\\r\\nnotwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the\\r\\nJack--who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes\\r\\non, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as\\r\\ninteresting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of\\r\\na drowned seaman washed ashore--asked me if we had seen a four-oared\\r\\ngalley going up with the tide? When I told him No, he said she must have\\r\\ngone down then, and yet she Ã¢\\x80\\x9ctook up too,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d when she left there.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey must ha' thought better on't for some reason or another,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nJack, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand gone down.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA four-oared galley, did you say?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA four,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Jack, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand two sitters.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid they come ashore here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey put in with a stone two-gallon jar for some beer. I'd ha' been\\r\\nglad to pison the beer myself,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Jack, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cor put some rattling\\r\\nphysic in it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI know why,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Jack. He spoke in a slushy voice, as if much mud\\r\\nhad washed into his throat.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe thinks,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the landlord, a weakly meditative man with a pale eye,\\r\\nwho seemed to rely greatly on his Jack,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9che thinks they was, what they\\r\\nwasn't.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI knows what I thinks,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d observed the Jack.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou thinks Custum 'Us, Jack?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the landlord.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Jack.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen you're wrong, Jack.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAM I!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in\\r\\nhis views, the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off, looked into\\r\\nit, knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it on\\r\\nagain. He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he could\\r\\nafford to do anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, what do you make out that they done with their buttons then,\\r\\nJack?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked the landlord, vacillating weakly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDone with their buttons?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned the Jack. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cChucked 'em overboard.\\r\\nSwallered 'em. Sowed 'em, to come up small salad. Done with their\\r\\nbuttons!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDon't be cheeky, Jack,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d remonstrated the landlord, in a melancholy and\\r\\npathetic way.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA Custum 'Us officer knows what to do with his Buttons,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Jack,\\r\\nrepeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhen they\\r\\ncomes betwixt him and his own light. A four and two sitters don't go\\r\\nhanging and hovering, up with one tide and down with another, and both\\r\\nwith and against another, without there being Custum 'Us at the bottom\\r\\nof it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Saying which he went out in disdain; and the landlord, having no\\r\\none to reply upon, found it impracticable to pursue the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal wind\\r\\nwas muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and\\r\\nI had a feeling that we were caged and threatened. A four-oared galley\\r\\nhovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly\\r\\ncircumstance that I could not get rid of. When I had induced Provis to\\r\\ngo up to bed, I went outside with my two companions (Startop by this\\r\\ntime knew the state of the case), and held another council. Whether we\\r\\nshould remain at the house until near the steamer's time, which would\\r\\nbe about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off early in the\\r\\nmorning, was the question we discussed. On the whole we deemed it the\\r\\nbetter course to lie where we were, until within an hour or so of the\\r\\nsteamer's time, and then to get out in her track, and drift easily with\\r\\nthe tide. Having settled to do this, we returned into the house and went\\r\\nto bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for a\\r\\nfew hours. When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house\\r\\n(the Ship) was creaking and banging about, with noises that startled\\r\\nme. Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of the\\r\\nwindow. It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and,\\r\\nas my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I saw\\r\\ntwo men looking into her. They passed by under the window, looking at\\r\\nnothing else, and they did not go down to the landing-place which I\\r\\ncould discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the direction\\r\\nof the Nore.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him the two men going\\r\\naway. But reflecting, before I got into his room, which was at the back\\r\\nof the house and adjoined mine, that he and Startop had had a harder day\\r\\nthan I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to my window, I could\\r\\nsee the two men moving over the marsh. In that light, however, I soon\\r\\nlost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of the matter, and\\r\\nfell asleep again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were up early. As we walked to and fro, all four together, before\\r\\nbreakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen. Again our\\r\\ncharge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that the\\r\\nmen belonged to the Custom House, he said quietly, and that they had no\\r\\nthought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so,--as, indeed,\\r\\nit might easily be. However, I proposed that he and I should walk away\\r\\ntogether to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take\\r\\nus aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about\\r\\nnoon. This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast he\\r\\nand I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me on\\r\\nthe shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was in danger,\\r\\nnot he, and that he was reassuring me. We spoke very little. As we\\r\\napproached the point, I begged him to remain in a sheltered place, while\\r\\nI went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the men had passed\\r\\nin the night. He complied, and I went on alone. There was no boat off\\r\\nthe point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor were there any\\r\\nsigns of the men having embarked there. But, to be sure, the tide was\\r\\nhigh, and there might have been some footpints under water.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that I\\r\\nwaved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we waited;\\r\\nsometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving\\r\\nabout to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round. We got\\r\\naboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By that time\\r\\nit wanted but ten minutes of one o'clock, and we began to look out for\\r\\nher smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwards\\r\\nwe saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on\\r\\nat full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity\\r\\nof saying good-bye to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken hands\\r\\ncordially, and neither Herbert's eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I\\r\\nsaw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way\\r\\nahead of us, and row out into the same track.\\r\\n\\r\\nA stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer's smoke,\\r\\nby reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible,\\r\\ncoming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the tide,\\r\\nthat she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis to sit\\r\\nquite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTrust to me,\\r\\ndear boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was very\\r\\nskilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, and fallen\\r\\nalongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars, she kept\\r\\nalongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or two when we\\r\\npulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and looked at us\\r\\nattentively,--as did all the rowers; the other sitter was wrapped up,\\r\\nmuch as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some instruction\\r\\nto the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken in either boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nStartop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,\\r\\nand gave me the word Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHamburg,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d in a low voice, as we sat face to face.\\r\\nShe was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew louder\\r\\nand louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us, when the\\r\\ngalley hailed us. I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou have a returned Transport there,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the man who held the lines.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch,\\r\\notherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender,\\r\\nand you to assist.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,\\r\\nhe ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke ahead,\\r\\nhad got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on to\\r\\nour gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great\\r\\nconfusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and\\r\\nheard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but felt\\r\\nher driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw the\\r\\nsteersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner's shoulder, and saw\\r\\nthat both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide, and\\r\\nsaw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite\\r\\nfrantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start\\r\\nup, lean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the\\r\\nshrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that the\\r\\nface disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago. Still, in\\r\\nthe same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it\\r\\nthat I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board the steamer,\\r\\nand a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink from under me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand\\r\\nmill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was\\r\\ntaken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there; but\\r\\nour boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of\\r\\nher steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first\\r\\ndistinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of the\\r\\ngalley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong\\r\\nstrokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently and\\r\\neagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it,\\r\\nbearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held up\\r\\nhis hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and\\r\\ntrue before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,\\r\\nbut not swimming freely. He was taken on board, and instantly manacled\\r\\nat the wrists and ankles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water\\r\\nwas resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not\\r\\nunderstanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she had\\r\\nbeen hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and\\r\\nwe were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The look-out was\\r\\nkept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone; but\\r\\neverybody knew that it was hopeless now.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern\\r\\nwe had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise. Here\\r\\nI was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,--Provis no longer,--who\\r\\nhad received some very severe injury in the chest, and a deep cut in the\\r\\nhead.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the\\r\\nsteamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury to\\r\\nhis chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thought\\r\\nhe had received against the side of the galley. He added that he did not\\r\\npretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson, but\\r\\nthat, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him,\\r\\nthat villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had both gone\\r\\noverboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him (Magwitch) out of\\r\\nour boat, and the endeavor of his captor to keep him in it, had capsized\\r\\nus. He told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in\\r\\neach other's arms, and that there had been a struggle under water, and\\r\\nthat he had disengaged himself, struck out, and swum away.\\r\\n\\r\\nI never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me.\\r\\nThe officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going\\r\\noverboard.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I asked this officer's permission to change the prisoner's\\r\\nwet clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the\\r\\npublic-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must take\\r\\ncharge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocket-book\\r\\nwhich had once been in my hands passed into the officer's. He further\\r\\ngave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to\\r\\naccord that grace to my two friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone\\r\\ndown, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was\\r\\nlikeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to me to\\r\\nbe much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it\\r\\ntook about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may\\r\\nhave been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in\\r\\nvarious stages of decay.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then Magwitch\\r\\nwas carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert and Startop\\r\\nwere to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We had a doleful\\r\\nparting, and when I took my place by Magwitch's side, I felt that that\\r\\nwas my place henceforth while he lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor now, my repugnance to him had all melted away; and in the hunted,\\r\\nwounded, shackled creature who held my hand in his, I only saw a man\\r\\nwho had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately,\\r\\ngratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a\\r\\nseries of years. I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to\\r\\nJoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on,\\r\\nand often he could not repress a groan. I tried to rest him on the arm\\r\\nI could use, in any easy position; but it was dreadful to think that\\r\\nI could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt, since it was\\r\\nunquestionably best that he should die. That there were, still living,\\r\\npeople enough who were able and willing to identify him, I could not\\r\\ndoubt. That he would be leniently treated, I could not hope. He who had\\r\\nbeen presented in the worst light at his trial, who had since broken\\r\\nprison and had been tried again, who had returned from transportation\\r\\nunder a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of the man who\\r\\nwas the cause of his arrest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us,\\r\\nand as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told him how\\r\\ngrieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he answered, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI'm quite content to take my chance. I've seen\\r\\nmy boy, and he can be a gentleman without me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side. No.\\r\\nApart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmick's hint now.\\r\\nI foresaw that, being convicted, his possessions would be forfeited to\\r\\nthe Crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLookee here, dear boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt's best as a gentleman should not be\\r\\nknowed to belong to me now. Only come to see me as if you come by chance\\r\\nalonger Wemmick. Sit where I can see you when I am swore to, for the\\r\\nlast o' many times, and I don't ask no more.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI will never stir from your side,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhen I am suffered to be\\r\\nnear you. Please God, I will be as true to you as you have been to me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt his hand tremble as it held mine, and he turned his face away\\r\\nas he lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in his\\r\\nthroat,--softened now, like all the rest of him. It was a good thing\\r\\nthat he had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I might not\\r\\notherwise have thought of until too late,--that he need never know how\\r\\nhis hopes of enriching me had perished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LV\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been\\r\\nimmediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send down\\r\\nfor an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped, to\\r\\nspeak to his identity. Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had meant\\r\\nto depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened that\\r\\nthere was not at that time any prison officer in London who could give\\r\\nthe required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his private\\r\\nhouse, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and Mr.\\r\\nJaggers on the prisoner's behalf would admit nothing. It was the sole\\r\\nresource; for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes\\r\\nwhen the witness was there, and that no power on earth could prevent its\\r\\ngoing against us.\\r\\n\\r\\nI imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the\\r\\nfate of his wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for\\r\\nhaving Ã¢\\x80\\x9clet it slip through my fingers,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and said we must memorialize\\r\\nby and by, and try at all events for some of it. But he did not conceal\\r\\nfrom me that, although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture\\r\\nwould not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this case to make\\r\\nit one of them. I understood that very well. I was not related to the\\r\\noutlaw, or connected with him by any recognizable tie; he had put his\\r\\nhand to no writing or settlement in my favor before his apprehension,\\r\\nand to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I finally resolved,\\r\\nand ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my heart should never\\r\\nbe sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer\\r\\nhad hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some\\r\\naccurate knowledge of Magwitch's affairs. When his body was found, many\\r\\nmiles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he\\r\\nwas only recognizable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still\\r\\nlegible, folded in a case he carried. Among these were the name of a\\r\\nbanking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the\\r\\ndesignation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of\\r\\ninformation were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.\\r\\nJaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit. His ignorance,\\r\\npoor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted but that my\\r\\ninheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers's aid.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter three days' delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over\\r\\nfor the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness\\r\\ncame, and completed the easy case. He was committed to take his trial at\\r\\nthe next Sessions, which would come on in a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one\\r\\nevening, a good deal cast down, and said,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than he\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and I am\\r\\nvery much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHerbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you; but\\r\\nmy need is no greater now than at another time.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou will be so lonely.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have not leisure to think of that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou know that I am\\r\\nalways with him to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I\\r\\nshould be with him all day long, if I could. And when I come away from\\r\\nhim, you know that my thoughts are with him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dreadful condition to which he was brought, was so appalling to both\\r\\nof us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear fellow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9clet the near prospect of our\\r\\nseparation--for, it is very near--be my justification for troubling you\\r\\nabout yourself. Have you thought of your future?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, for I have been afraid to think of any future.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it must not\\r\\nbe dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a few friendly\\r\\nwords go, with me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI will,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA\\r\\nclerk.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand (as\\r\\na clerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner. Now,\\r\\nHandel,--in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in\\r\\nwhich after saying Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Handel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d as if it were the grave beginning of\\r\\na portentous business exordium, he had suddenly given up that tone,\\r\\nstretched out his honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cClara and I have talked about it again and again,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Herbert pursued,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cand the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in\\r\\nher eyes, to say to you that, if you will live with us when we come\\r\\ntogether, she will do her best to make you happy, and to convince her\\r\\nhusband's friend that he is her friend too. We should get on so well,\\r\\nHandel!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI thanked her heartily, and I thanked him heartily, but said I could not\\r\\nyet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered. Firstly, my\\r\\nmind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly.\\r\\nSecondly,--Yes! Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my\\r\\nthoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injury\\r\\nto your business, leave the question open for a little while--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFor any while,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Herbert. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSix months, a year!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot so long as that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTwo or three months at most.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHerbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement,\\r\\nand said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must\\r\\ngo away at the end of the week.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd Clara?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe dear little thing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Herbert, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cholds dutifully to her\\r\\nfather as long as he lasts; but he won't last long. Mrs. Whimple\\r\\nconfides to me that he is certainly going.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot to say an unfeeling thing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9che cannot do better than go.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am afraid that must be admitted,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Herbert; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand then I shall\\r\\ncome back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I\\r\\nwill walk quietly into the nearest church. Remember! The blessed darling\\r\\ncomes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into the red book,\\r\\nand hasn't a notion about her grandpapa. What a fortune for the son of\\r\\nmy mother!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,--full\\r\\nof bright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,--as he sat on one of the\\r\\nseaport mail coaches. I went into a coffee-house to write a little note\\r\\nto Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over and\\r\\nover again, and then went to my lonely home,--if it deserved the name;\\r\\nfor it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after an\\r\\nunsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door. I had not seen him\\r\\nalone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he had\\r\\ncome, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words of\\r\\nexplanation in reference to that failure.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe late Compeyson,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chad by little and little got at the\\r\\nbottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was from\\r\\nthe talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his people being\\r\\nalways in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open, seeming\\r\\nto have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I thought that\\r\\nwould be the best time for making the attempt. I can only suppose now,\\r\\nthat it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man, habitually to\\r\\ndeceive his own instruments. You don't blame me, I hope, Mr. Pip? I am\\r\\nsure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most\\r\\nearnestly for all your interest and friendship.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThank you, thank you very much. It's a bad job,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick,\\r\\nscratching his head, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I assure you I haven't been so cut up for a\\r\\nlong time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property.\\r\\nDear me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat I think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, to be sure,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course, there can be no objection\\r\\nto your being sorry for him, and I'd put down a five-pound note myself\\r\\nto get him out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeyson\\r\\nhaving been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and being\\r\\nso determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have been\\r\\nsaved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been saved.\\r\\nThat's the difference between the property and the owner, don't you\\r\\nsee?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass\\r\\nof grog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation. While he\\r\\nwas drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up to\\r\\nit, and after having appeared rather fidgety,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThese twelve years, more likely,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes. I'm going to take\\r\\na holiday. More than that; I'm going to take a walk. More than that; I'm\\r\\ngoing to ask you to take a walk with me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then,\\r\\nwhen Wemmick anticipated me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI know your engagements,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I know you are out of sorts,\\r\\nMr. Pip. But if you could oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.\\r\\nIt ain't a long walk, and it's an early one. Say it might occupy you\\r\\n(including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. Couldn't you\\r\\nstretch a point and manage it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little\\r\\nto do for him. I said I could manage it,--would manage it,--and he was\\r\\nso very much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At his\\r\\nparticular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half\\r\\npast eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nPunctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday\\r\\nmorning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as looking\\r\\ntighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were two\\r\\nglasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must have\\r\\nbeen stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his\\r\\nbedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and\\r\\nwere going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was\\r\\nconsiderably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put\\r\\nit over his shoulder. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, we are not going fishing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n returned Wemmick, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I like to walk with one.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went\\r\\ntowards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said\\r\\nsuddenly,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHalloa! Here's a church!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather\\r\\nsurprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLet's go in!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and looked all\\r\\nround. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets, and\\r\\ngetting something out of paper there.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHalloa!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHere's a couple of pair of gloves! Let's put 'em\\r\\non!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened\\r\\nto its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They\\r\\nwere strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side\\r\\ndoor, escorting a lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHalloa!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHere's Miss Skiffins! Let's have a wedding.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now\\r\\nengaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white. The\\r\\nAged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for\\r\\nthe altar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much\\r\\ndifficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary\\r\\nto put him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the\\r\\npillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old\\r\\ngentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and safe\\r\\nresistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to\\r\\nperfection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at\\r\\nthose fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all without\\r\\npreparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something out of\\r\\nhis waistcoat-pocket before the service began, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHalloa! Here's a ring!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom; while\\r\\na little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby's, made a feint\\r\\nof being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of giving\\r\\nthe lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the clergyman's being\\r\\nunintentionally scandalized, and it happened thus. When he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWho\\r\\ngiveth this woman to be married to this man?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the old gentleman, not in\\r\\nthe least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at, stood\\r\\nmost amiably beaming at the ten commandments. Upon which, the clergyman\\r\\nsaid again, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWHO giveth this woman to be married to this man?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The old\\r\\ngentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness, the\\r\\nbridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow Aged P. you know; who\\r\\ngiveth?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d To which the Aged replied with great briskness, before saying\\r\\nthat he gave, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAll right, John, all right, my boy!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And the clergyman\\r\\ncame to so gloomy a pause upon it, that I had doubts for the moment\\r\\nwhether we should get completely married that day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church\\r\\nWemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it, and\\r\\nput the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future, put\\r\\nher white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Mr. Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came\\r\\nout, Ã¢\\x80\\x9clet me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a\\r\\nwedding-party!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBreakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so\\r\\naway upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle\\r\\nboard in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after\\r\\nthe solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer\\r\\nunwound Wemmick's arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in a\\r\\nhigh-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case, and\\r\\nsubmitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on\\r\\ntable, Wemmick said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cProvided by contract, you know; don't be afraid of\\r\\nit!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the Castle,\\r\\nsaluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I could.\\r\\n\\r\\nWemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with him,\\r\\nand wished him joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThankee!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe's such a manager\\r\\nof fowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for\\r\\nyourself. I say, Mr. Pip!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d calling me back, and speaking low. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThis is\\r\\naltogether a Walworth sentiment, please.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nWemmick nodded. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAfter what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers\\r\\nmay as well not know of it. He might think my brain was softening, or\\r\\nsomething of the kind.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LVI\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his\\r\\ncommittal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions. He had broken\\r\\ntwo ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great\\r\\npain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his\\r\\nhurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke\\r\\nvery little. But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the\\r\\nfirst duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he\\r\\nought to hear.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed, after\\r\\nthe first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities\\r\\nof being with him that I could not otherwise have had. And but for\\r\\nhis illness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a\\r\\ndetermined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the\\r\\nregularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record\\r\\non his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state. I\\r\\ndo not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he\\r\\nwasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day\\r\\nwhen the prison door closed upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man\\r\\nwho was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner\\r\\nor from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered\\r\\nover the question whether he might have been a better man under better\\r\\ncircumstances. But he never justified himself by a hint tending that\\r\\nway, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his desperate\\r\\nreputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on\\r\\nhim. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his eyes on me with\\r\\na trustful look, as if he were confident that I had seen some small\\r\\nredeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was a little child.\\r\\nAs to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and I never knew him\\r\\ncomplain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be\\r\\nmade for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions. It\\r\\nwas obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long,\\r\\nand was refused. The trial came on at once, and, when he was put to the\\r\\nbar, he was seated in a chair. No objection was made to my getting\\r\\nclose to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that he\\r\\nstretched forth to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be said\\r\\nfor him were said,--how he had taken to industrious habits, and had\\r\\nthriven lawfully and reputably. But nothing could unsay the fact that\\r\\nhe had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury. It was\\r\\nimpossible to try him for that, and do otherwise than find him guilty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible experience\\r\\nof that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing of\\r\\nSentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of Death.\\r\\nBut for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me,\\r\\nI could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that I saw\\r\\ntwo-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that\\r\\nsentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated,\\r\\nthat he might get breath enough to keep life in him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment, down\\r\\nto the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering in\\r\\nthe rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside it\\r\\nat the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men\\r\\nand women; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and\\r\\nweeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There\\r\\nhad been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been\\r\\nstilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains\\r\\nand nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great\\r\\ngallery full of people,--a large theatrical audience,--looked on, as the\\r\\ntwo-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge\\r\\naddressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must\\r\\nsingle out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had\\r\\nbeen an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments and\\r\\npunishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years;\\r\\nand who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had made his\\r\\nescape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable man would\\r\\nseem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when far removed\\r\\nfrom the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a peaceable and\\r\\nhonest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those propensities and\\r\\npassions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to\\r\\nsociety, he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance, and had\\r\\ncome back to the country where he was proscribed. Being here presently\\r\\ndenounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of\\r\\nJustice, but being at length seized while in the act of flight, he had\\r\\nresisted them, and had--he best knew whether by express design, or in\\r\\nthe blindness of his hardihood--caused the death of his denouncer, to\\r\\nwhom his whole career was known. The appointed punishment for his return\\r\\nto the land that had cast him out, being Death, and his case being this\\r\\naggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the\\r\\nglittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of\\r\\nlight between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,\\r\\nand perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,\\r\\nwith absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all things,\\r\\nand cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face in this\\r\\nway of light, the prisoner said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMy Lord, I have received my sentence\\r\\nof Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and sat down again.\\r\\nThere was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had to say\\r\\nto the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of them were\\r\\nsupported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of\\r\\nbravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three shook hands,\\r\\nand others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from\\r\\nthe sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because of having to\\r\\nbe helped from his chair, and to go very slowly; and he held my hand\\r\\nwhile all the others were removed, and while the audience got up\\r\\n(putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere), and\\r\\npointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him and me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorder's\\r\\nReport was made; but, in the dread of his lingering on, I began that\\r\\nnight to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting\\r\\nforth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he had come back for my\\r\\nsake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I\\r\\nhad finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men\\r\\nin authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the\\r\\nCrown itself. For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took\\r\\nno rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed\\r\\nin these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away\\r\\nfrom the places where they were, but felt as if they were more\\r\\nhopeful and less desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable\\r\\nrestlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening,\\r\\nwandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions. To\\r\\nthe present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold, dusty\\r\\nspring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, and their\\r\\nlong rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was more\\r\\nstrictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an intention\\r\\nof carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I sat down\\r\\nat his bedside, and told the officer who was always there, that I was\\r\\nwilling to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my\\r\\ndesigns. Nobody was hard with him or with me. There was duty to be\\r\\ndone, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer always gave me the\\r\\nassurance that he was worse, and some other sick prisoners in the\\r\\nroom, and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses,\\r\\n(malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be thanked!) always\\r\\njoined in the same report.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly\\r\\nlooking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face\\r\\nuntil some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would\\r\\nsubside again. Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, then\\r\\nhe would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to\\r\\nunderstand his meaning very well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change\\r\\nin him than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards the door, and\\r\\nlighted up as I entered.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear boy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, as I sat down by his bed: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI thought you was late.\\r\\nBut I knowed you couldn't be that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt is just the time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI waited for it at the gate.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou always waits at the gate; don't you, dear boy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. Not to lose a moment of the time.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThank'ee dear boy, thank'ee. God bless you! You've never deserted me,\\r\\ndear boy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once\\r\\nmeant to desert him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd what's the best of all,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou've been more comfortable\\r\\nalonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.\\r\\nThat's best of all.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he would,\\r\\nand love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and a\\r\\nfilm came over the placid look at the white ceiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you in much pain to-day?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI don't complain of none, dear boy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou never do complain.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had spoken his last words. He smiled, and I understood his touch to\\r\\nmean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast. I laid it\\r\\nthere, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I\\r\\nfound the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou needn't go yet.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I thanked him gratefully, and asked, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMight I\\r\\nspeak to him, if he can hear me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change,\\r\\nthough it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid\\r\\nlook at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what I\\r\\nsay?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA gentle pressure on my hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou had a child once, whom you loved and lost.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA stronger pressure on my hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe lived, and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is a lady\\r\\nand very beautiful. And I love her!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my\\r\\nyielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips. Then,\\r\\nhe gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lying on\\r\\nit. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away, and\\r\\nhis head dropped quietly on his breast.\\r\\n\\r\\nMindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men\\r\\nwho went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better\\r\\nwords that I could say beside his bed, than Ã¢\\x80\\x9cO Lord, be merciful to him\\r\\na sinner!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LVII\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that I was left wholly to myself, I gave notice of my intention\\r\\nto quit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legally\\r\\ndetermine, and in the meanwhile to underlet them. At once I put bills\\r\\nup in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, and\\r\\nbegan to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs. I ought\\r\\nrather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and\\r\\nconcentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth\\r\\nbeyond the fact that I was falling very ill. The late stress upon me had\\r\\nenabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew that it\\r\\nwas coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was even careless\\r\\nas to that.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor,--anywhere,\\r\\naccording as I happened to sink down,--with a heavy head and aching\\r\\nlimbs, and no purpose, and no power. Then there came, one night which\\r\\nappeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror;\\r\\nand when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, I\\r\\nfound I could not do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the night,\\r\\ngroping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whether I had\\r\\ntwo or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror,\\r\\nnot knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found myself\\r\\nlighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he was coming up\\r\\nthe stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been\\r\\ninexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and groaning\\r\\nof some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making;\\r\\nwhether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of\\r\\nthe room, and a voice had called out, over and over again, that Miss\\r\\nHavisham was consuming within it,--these were things that I tried to\\r\\nsettle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that morning on\\r\\nmy bed. But the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them,\\r\\ndisordering them all, and it was through the vapor at last that I saw\\r\\ntwo men looking at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you want?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked, starting; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI don't know you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned one of them, bending down and touching me on the\\r\\nshoulder, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthis is a matter that you'll soon arrange, I dare say, but\\r\\nyou're arrested.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is the debt?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHundred and twenty-three pound, fifteen, six. Jeweller's account, I\\r\\nthink.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is to be done?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou had better come to my house,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the man. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI keep a very nice\\r\\nhouse.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next attended\\r\\nto them, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me. I\\r\\nstill lay there.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou see my state,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI would come with you if I could; but\\r\\nindeed I am quite unable. If you take me from here, I think I shall die\\r\\nby the way.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage me to\\r\\nbelieve that I was better than I thought. Forasmuch as they hang in\\r\\nmy memory by only this one slender thread, I don't know what they did,\\r\\nexcept that they forbore to remove me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that\\r\\nI often lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that I\\r\\nconfounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was a\\r\\nbrick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from the\\r\\ngiddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of a\\r\\nvast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I implored\\r\\nin my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammered\\r\\noff; that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my own\\r\\nremembrance, and did in some sort know at the time. That I sometimes\\r\\nstruggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, and\\r\\nthat I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, and\\r\\nwould then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay me\\r\\ndown, I also knew at the time. But, above all, I knew that there was a\\r\\nconstant tendency in all these people,--who, when I was very ill, would\\r\\npresent all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face,\\r\\nand would be much dilated in size,--above all, I say, I knew that there\\r\\nwas an extraordinary tendency in all these people, sooner or later, to\\r\\nsettle down into the likeness of Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to notice that\\r\\nwhile all its other features changed, this one consistent feature did\\r\\nnot change. Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe. I opened\\r\\nmy eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at the bedside, Joe.\\r\\nI opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on the window-seat, smoking\\r\\nhis pipe in the shaded open window, still I saw Joe. I asked for cooling\\r\\ndrink, and the dear hand that gave it me was Joe's. I sank back on\\r\\nmy pillow after drinking, and the face that looked so hopefully and\\r\\ntenderly upon me was the face of Joe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, one day, I took courage, and said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIs it Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the dear old home-voice answered, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhich it air, old chap.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO Joe, you break my heart! Look angry at me, Joe. Strike me, Joe. Tell\\r\\nme of my ingratitude. Don't be so good to me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side, and\\r\\nput his arm round my neck, in his joy that I knew him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich dear old Pip, old chap,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou and me was ever friends.\\r\\nAnd when you're well enough to go out for a ride--what larks!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter which, Joe withdrew to the window, and stood with his back towards\\r\\nme, wiping his eyes. And as my extreme weakness prevented me from\\r\\ngetting up and going to him, I lay there, penitently whispering, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cO God\\r\\nbless him! O God bless this gentle Christian man!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe's eyes were red when I next found him beside me; but I was holding\\r\\nhis hand, and we both felt happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow long, dear Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted, dear old\\r\\nchap?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Joe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's the end of May, Pip. To-morrow is the first of June.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd have you been here all that time, dear Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPretty nigh, old chap. For, as I says to Biddy when the news of your\\r\\nbeing ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post, and\\r\\nbeing formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal of\\r\\nwalking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on his part, and\\r\\nmarriage were the great wish of his hart--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt is so delightful to hear you, Joe! But I interrupt you in what you\\r\\nsaid to Biddy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich it were,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat how you might be amongst strangers, and\\r\\nthat how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such a moment\\r\\nmight not prove unacceptabobble. And Biddy, her word were, 'Go to him,\\r\\nwithout loss of time.' That,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, summing up with his judicial\\r\\nair, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwere the word of Biddy. 'Go to him,' Biddy say, 'without loss of\\r\\ntime.' In short, I shouldn't greatly deceive you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe added, after a\\r\\nlittle grave reflection, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif I represented to you that the word of that\\r\\nyoung woman were, 'without a minute's loss of time.'Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked\\r\\nto in great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at\\r\\nstated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that\\r\\nI was to submit myself to all his orders. So I kissed his hand, and lay\\r\\nquiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidently Biddy had taught Joe to write. As I lay in bed looking at him,\\r\\nit made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the\\r\\npride with which he set about his letter. My bedstead, divested of its\\r\\ncurtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, as\\r\\nthe airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and\\r\\nthe room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own\\r\\nwriting-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,\\r\\nJoe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the\\r\\npen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his\\r\\nsleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It was\\r\\nnecessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,\\r\\nand to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin; and\\r\\nwhen he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might\\r\\nhave been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his pen\\r\\nspluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was\\r\\non the side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into\\r\\nspace, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he was\\r\\ntripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole\\r\\nhe got on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and had\\r\\nremoved a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with\\r\\nhis two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the\\r\\neffect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there,\\r\\nwith unbounded satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able to\\r\\ntalk much, I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day. He\\r\\nshook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs she dead, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy you see, old chap,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and by way\\r\\nof getting at it by degrees, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wouldn't go so far as to say that, for\\r\\nthat's a deal to say; but she ain't--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLiving, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's nigher where it is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cshe ain't living.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid she linger long, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cArter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call (if you\\r\\nwas put to it) a week,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe; still determined, on my account, to\\r\\ncome at everything by degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her property?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, old chap,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit do appear that she had settled the most\\r\\nof it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella. But she had\\r\\nwrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the\\r\\naccident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket. And why,\\r\\ndo you suppose, above all things, Pip, she left that cool four thousand\\r\\nunto him? 'Because of Pip's account of him, the said Matthew.' I am told\\r\\nby Biddy, that air the writing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, repeating the legal turn as\\r\\nif it did him infinite good, Ã¢\\x80\\x9c'account of him the said Matthew.' And a\\r\\ncool four thousand, Pip!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperature of\\r\\nthe four thousand pounds; but it appeared to make the sum of money more\\r\\nto him, and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing I\\r\\nhad done. I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other relations\\r\\nhad any legacies?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss Sarah,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cshe have twenty-five pound perannium fur to\\r\\nbuy pills, on account of being bilious. Miss Georgiana, she have twenty\\r\\npound down. Mrs.--what's the name of them wild beasts with humps, old\\r\\nchap?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCamels?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, wondering why he could possibly want to know.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe nodded. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMrs. Camels,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d by which I presently understood he meant\\r\\nCamilla, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cshe have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in\\r\\nspirits when she wake up in the night.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to give\\r\\nme great confidence in Joe's information. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd now,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou\\r\\nain't that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor one\\r\\nadditional shovelful to-day. Old Orlick he's been a bustin' open a\\r\\ndwelling-ouse.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhose?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot, I grant you, but what his manners is given to blusterous,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nJoe, apologetically; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cstill, a Englishman's ouse is his Castle, and\\r\\ncastles must not be busted 'cept when done in war time. And wotsume'er\\r\\nthe failings on his part, he were a corn and seedsman in his hart.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs it Pumblechook's house that has been broken into, then?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat's it, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand they took his till, and they took his\\r\\ncash-box, and they drinked his wine, and they partook of his wittles,\\r\\nand they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose, and they tied him\\r\\nup to his bedpust, and they giv' him a dozen, and they stuffed his\\r\\nmouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out. But he knowed\\r\\nOrlick, and Orlick's in the county jail.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation. I was slow\\r\\nto gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Joe\\r\\nstayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need,\\r\\nthat I was like a child in his hands. He would sit and talk to me in the\\r\\nold confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old unassertive\\r\\nprotecting way, so that I would half believe that all my life since the\\r\\ndays of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that\\r\\nwas gone. He did everything for me except the household work, for which\\r\\nhe had engaged a very decent woman, after paying off the laundress on\\r\\nhis first arrival. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhich I do assure you, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he would often say, in\\r\\nexplanation of that liberty; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI found her a tapping the spare bed, like\\r\\na cask of beer, and drawing off the feathers in a bucket, for sale.\\r\\nWhich she would have tapped yourn next, and draw'd it off with you a\\r\\nlaying on it, and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in\\r\\nthe soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes, and the wine and spirits in your\\r\\nWellington boots.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had\\r\\nonce looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship. And when the day\\r\\ncame, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up,\\r\\ntook me in his arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I were\\r\\nstill the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of\\r\\nthe wealth of his great nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country,\\r\\nwhere the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass,\\r\\nand sweet summer scents filled all the air. The day happened to be\\r\\nSunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought\\r\\nhow it had grown and changed, and how the little wild-flowers had been\\r\\nforming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and\\r\\nby night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burning\\r\\nand tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed\\r\\nthere came like a check upon my peace. But when I heard the Sunday\\r\\nbells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I felt\\r\\nthat I was not nearly thankful enough,--that I was too weak yet to be\\r\\neven that,--and I laid my head on Joe's shoulder, as I had laid it long\\r\\nago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too much\\r\\nfor my young senses.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used\\r\\nto talk, lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no change\\r\\nwhatever in Joe. Exactly what he had been in my eyes then, he was in my\\r\\neyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we got back again, and he lifted me out, and carried me--so\\r\\neasily!--across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventful\\r\\nChristmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes. We had not yet\\r\\nmade any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much of\\r\\nmy late history he was acquainted with. I was so doubtful of myself now,\\r\\nand put so much trust in him, that I could not satisfy myself whether I\\r\\nought to refer to it when he did not.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you heard, Joe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I asked him that evening, upon further\\r\\nconsideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwho my patron was?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI heerd,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas it were not Miss Havisham, old chap.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid you hear who it was, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv' you\\r\\nthe bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo it was.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAstonishing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, in the placidest way.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid you hear that he was dead, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I presently asked, with increasing\\r\\ndiffidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich? Him as sent the bank-notes, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking rather\\r\\nevasively at the window-seat, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas I did hear tell that how he were\\r\\nsomething or another in a general way in that direction.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid you hear anything of his circumstances, Joe?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot partickler, Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you would like to hear, Joe--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I was beginning, when Joe got up and\\r\\ncame to my sofa.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLookee here, old chap,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, bending over me. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cEver the best of\\r\\nfriends; ain't us, Pip?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was ashamed to answer him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWery good, then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, as if I had answered; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat's all right;\\r\\nthat's agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as\\r\\nbetwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? There's subjects enough\\r\\nas betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lord! To think of your\\r\\npoor sister and her Rampages! And don't you remember Tickler?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI do indeed, Joe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLookee here, old chap,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI done what I could to keep you\\r\\nand Tickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my\\r\\ninclinations. For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, it\\r\\nwere not so much,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, in his favorite argumentative way, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat\\r\\nshe dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her, but that\\r\\nshe dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that. It ain't a\\r\\ngrab at a man's whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man (to which your\\r\\nsister was quite welcome), that 'ud put a man off from getting a little\\r\\nchild out of punishment. But when that little child is dropped into\\r\\nheavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally up\\r\\nand says to himself, 'Where is the good as you are a doing? I grant you\\r\\nI see the 'arm,' says the man, 'but I don't see the good. I call upon\\r\\nyou, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.'Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe man says?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe man says,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe assented. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIs he right, that man?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear Joe, he is always right.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, old chap,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthen abide by your words. If he's always\\r\\nright (which in general he's more likely wrong), he's right when he says\\r\\nthis: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when you\\r\\nwas a little child, you kep it mostly because you know'd as J. Gargery's\\r\\npower to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his\\r\\ninclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two sech, and do\\r\\nnot let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy giv' herself a\\r\\ndeal o' trouble with me afore I left (for I am almost awful dull), as I\\r\\nshould view it in this light, and, viewing it in this light, as I should\\r\\nso put it. Both of which,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, quite charmed with his logical\\r\\narrangement, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbeing done, now this to you a true friend, say. Namely.\\r\\nYou mustn't go a overdoing on it, but you must have your supper and your\\r\\nwine and water, and you must be put betwixt the sheets.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact and\\r\\nkindness with which Biddy--who with her woman's wit had found me out so\\r\\nsoon--had prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind. But\\r\\nwhether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had\\r\\nall dissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not\\r\\nunderstand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to\\r\\ndevelop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension\\r\\nof, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less\\r\\neasy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear\\r\\nfellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,\\r\\nthe dear Ã¢\\x80\\x9cold Pip, old chap,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d that now were music in my ears. I too had\\r\\nfallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me. But,\\r\\nimperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe's hold upon them began\\r\\nto slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to\\r\\nunderstand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was\\r\\nall mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that\\r\\nin prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off? Had I given\\r\\nJoe's innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got\\r\\nstronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better\\r\\nloosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the\\r\\nTemple Gardens leaning on Joe's arm, that I saw this change in him very\\r\\nplainly. We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking at the\\r\\nriver, and I chanced to say as we got up,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSee, Joe! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk back by\\r\\nmyself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich do not overdo it, Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I shall be happy fur to\\r\\nsee you able, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I walked no\\r\\nfurther than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be\\r\\nweaker than I was, and asked Joe for his arm. Joe gave it me, but was\\r\\nthoughtful.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing\\r\\nchange in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That I\\r\\nwas ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had come\\r\\ndown to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not\\r\\nquite an unworthy one. He would want to help me out of his little\\r\\nsavings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that I\\r\\nmust not suffer him to do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went to\\r\\nbed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,--to-morrow being\\r\\nSunday,--and would begin my new course with the new week. On Monday\\r\\nmorning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this\\r\\nlast vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts\\r\\n(that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to go\\r\\nout to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever. As I\\r\\ncleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he had sympathetically\\r\\narrived at a resolution too.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and\\r\\nthen walked in the fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear old Pip, old chap, you're a'most come round, sir.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt has been a memorable time for me, Joe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLikeways for myself, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joe returned.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget. There were\\r\\ndays once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall\\r\\nforget these.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthere has\\r\\nbeen larks. And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us--have been.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he had done\\r\\nall through my recovery. He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well\\r\\nas in the morning?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, dear Joe, quite.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd are always a getting stronger, old chap?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, dear Joe, steadily.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand, and\\r\\nsaid, in what I thought a husky voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGood night!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of\\r\\nmy resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. I would tell him before\\r\\nbreakfast. I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him;\\r\\nfor, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to his room, and\\r\\nhe was not there. Not only was he not there, but his box was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter. These\\r\\nwere its brief contents:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear\\r\\nPip and will do better without JO.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cP.S. Ever the best of friends.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEnclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I\\r\\nhad been arrested. Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that my\\r\\ncreditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should be quite\\r\\nrecovered. I had never dreamed of Joe's having paid the money; but Joe\\r\\nhad paid it, and the receipt was in his name.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat remained for me now, but to follow him to the dear old forge, and\\r\\nthere to have out my disclosure to him, and my penitent remonstrance\\r\\nwith him, and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved\\r\\nSecondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts,\\r\\nand had formed into a settled purpose?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show her how\\r\\nhumbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell her how I had lost\\r\\nall I once hoped for, that I would remind her of our old confidences in\\r\\nmy first unhappy time. Then I would say to her, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy, I think you once\\r\\nliked me very well, when my errant heart, even while it strayed away\\r\\nfrom you, was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since.\\r\\nIf you can like me only half as well once more, if you can take me with\\r\\nall my faults and disappointments on my head, if you can receive me like\\r\\na forgiven child (and indeed I am as sorry, Biddy, and have as much need\\r\\nof a hushing voice and a soothing hand), I hope I am a little worthier\\r\\nof you that I was,--not much, but a little. And, Biddy, it shall rest\\r\\nwith you to say whether I shall work at the forge with Joe, or whether I\\r\\nshall try for any different occupation down in this country, or whether\\r\\nwe shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which\\r\\nI set aside, when it was offered, until I knew your answer. And now,\\r\\ndear Biddy, if you can tell me that you will go through the world with\\r\\nme, you will surely make it a better world for me, and me a better man\\r\\nfor it, and I will try hard to make it a better world for you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was my purpose. After three days more of recovery, I went down to\\r\\nthe old place to put it in execution. And how I sped in it is all I have\\r\\nleft to tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down\\r\\nto my native place and its neighborhood before I got there. I found the\\r\\nBlue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made a\\r\\ngreat change in the Boar's demeanour. Whereas the Boar had cultivated\\r\\nmy good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property,\\r\\nthe Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out of\\r\\nproperty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had so\\r\\noften made so easily. The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom,\\r\\nwhich was engaged (probably by some one who had expectations), and\\r\\ncould only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and\\r\\npost-chaises up the yard. But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as\\r\\nin the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, and the\\r\\nquality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolled\\r\\nround by Satis House. There were printed bills on the gate and on bits\\r\\nof carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of\\r\\nthe Household Furniture and Effects, next week. The House itself was to\\r\\nbe sold as old building materials, and pulled down. LOT 1 was marked in\\r\\nwhitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part of\\r\\nthe main building which had been so long shut up. Other lots were marked\\r\\noff on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torn down to\\r\\nmake room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in the dust\\r\\nand was withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the open gate, and\\r\\nlooking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no\\r\\nbusiness there, I saw the auctioneer's clerk walking on the casks and\\r\\ntelling them off for the information of a catalogue-compiler, pen in\\r\\nhand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so often\\r\\npushed along to the tune of Old Clem.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got back to my breakfast in the Boar's coffee-room, I found Mr.\\r\\nPumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr. Pumblechook (not improved\\r\\nin appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and\\r\\naddressed me in the following terms:--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYoung man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else could be\\r\\nexpected! what else could be expected!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I was\\r\\nbroken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWilliam,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cput a muffin on table.\\r\\nAnd has it come to this! Has it come to this!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mr. Pumblechook stood over me and\\r\\npoured out my tea--before I could touch the teapot--with the air of a\\r\\nbenefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWilliam,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cput the salt on. In\\r\\nhappier times,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d addressing me, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think you took sugar? And did you take\\r\\nmilk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a watercress.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThank you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, shortly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I don't eat watercresses.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou don't eat 'em,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding\\r\\nhis head several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if\\r\\nabstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTrue.\\r\\nThe simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn't bring any, William.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand over\\r\\nme, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLittle more than skin and bone!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd yet\\r\\nwhen he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread afore\\r\\nhim my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner\\r\\nin which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMay I?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the\\r\\nsame fat five fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHah!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he went on, handing me the bread and butter. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd air you a going\\r\\nto Joseph?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn heaven's name,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, firing in spite of myself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat does it\\r\\nmatter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook\\r\\nthe opportunity he wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, young man,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said he, releasing the handle of the article in\\r\\nquestion, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the\\r\\nbehoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI will leave that teapot\\r\\nalone. You are right, young man. For once you are right. I forgit myself\\r\\nwhen I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to wish your frame,\\r\\nexhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality, to be stimilated\\r\\nby the 'olesome nourishment of your forefathers. And yet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nPumblechook, turning to the landlord and waiter, and pointing me out at\\r\\narm's length, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthis is him as I ever sported with in his days of happy\\r\\ninfancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I tell you this is him!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be\\r\\nparticularly affected.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Pumblechook, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas I have rode in my shay-cart. This\\r\\nis him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him untoe the sister\\r\\nof which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M'ria from\\r\\nher own mother, let him deny it if he can!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave\\r\\nthe case a black look.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYoung man,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the old\\r\\nfashion, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou air a going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you\\r\\nask me, where you air a going? I say to you, Sir, you air a going to\\r\\nJoseph.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air\\r\\nof saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and\\r\\nconclusive, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of\\r\\nthe Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is William,\\r\\nwhich his father's name was Potkins if I do not deceive myself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou do not, sir,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said William.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn their presence,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d pursued Pumblechook, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI will tell you, young\\r\\nman, what to say to Joseph. Says you, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cJoseph, I have this day seen\\r\\nmy earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun's. I will name no\\r\\nnames, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I have\\r\\nseen that man.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI swear I don't see him here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSay that likewise,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d retorted Pumblechook. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSay you said that, and even\\r\\nJoseph will probably betray surprise.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere you quite mistake him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI know better.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSays you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Pumblechook went on, Ã¢\\x80\\x9c'Joseph, I have seen that man, and\\r\\nthat man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He knows your\\r\\ncharacter, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and\\r\\nignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want of\\r\\ngratitoode. Yes, Joseph,' says you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d here Pumblechook shook his head and\\r\\nhand at me, Ã¢\\x80\\x9c'he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode.\\r\\nHe knows it, Joseph, as none can. You do not know it, Joseph, having no\\r\\ncall to know it, but that man do.'Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWindy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the face\\r\\nto talk thus to mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSays you, 'Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now\\r\\nrepeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger of\\r\\nProvidence. He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw it\\r\\nplain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. Reward of ingratitoode to his\\r\\nearliest benefactor, and founder of fortun's. But that man said he did\\r\\nnot repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right to do\\r\\nit, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would do it\\r\\nagain.'Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's pity,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted breakfast,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cthat the man did not say what he had done and would do again.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSquires of the Boar!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand\\r\\nWilliam! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town or down\\r\\ntown, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do it, kind to\\r\\ndo it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,\\r\\nand left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by\\r\\nthe virtues of that same indefinite Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I was not long after him in\\r\\nleaving the house too, and when I went down the High Street I saw him\\r\\nholding forth (no doubt to the same effect) at his shop door to a select\\r\\ngroup, who honored me with very unfavorable glances as I passed on the\\r\\nopposite side of the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whose\\r\\ngreat forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be,\\r\\ncontrasted with this brazen pretender. I went towards them slowly, for\\r\\nmy limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew\\r\\nnearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness\\r\\nfurther and further behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks were soaring\\r\\nhigh over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more beautiful\\r\\nand peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet. Many pleasant\\r\\npictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the change for the\\r\\nbetter that would come over my character when I had a guiding spirit at\\r\\nmy side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I had proved, beguiled\\r\\nmy way. They awakened a tender emotion in me; for my heart was softened\\r\\nby my return, and such a change had come to pass, that I felt like one\\r\\nwho was toiling home barefoot from distant travel, and whose wanderings\\r\\nhad lasted many years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but, the\\r\\nlittle roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness'\\r\\nsake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the day was a\\r\\nholiday; no children were there, and Biddy's house was closed. Some\\r\\nhopeful notion of seeing her, busily engaged in her daily duties, before\\r\\nshe saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it under\\r\\nthe sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe's hammer. Long\\r\\nafter I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I heard it\\r\\nand found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there, and the\\r\\nwhite thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and their\\r\\nleaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, the clink of\\r\\nJoe's hammer was not in the midsummer wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I saw\\r\\nit at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, no glittering\\r\\nshower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and still.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the house was not deserted, and the best parlor seemed to be in use,\\r\\nfor there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the window\\r\\nwas open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it, meaning to peep\\r\\nover the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm in arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first Biddy gave a cry, as if she thought it was my apparition, but\\r\\nin another moment she was in my embrace. I wept to see her, and she wept\\r\\nto see me; I, because she looked so fresh and pleasant; she, because I\\r\\nlooked so worn and white.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut dear Biddy, how smart you are!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, dear Pip.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd Joe, how smart you are!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, dear old Pip, old chap.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt's my wedding-day!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I am\\r\\nmarried to Joe!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on\\r\\nthe old deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and Joe's\\r\\nrestoring touch was on my shoulder. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhich he warn't strong enough, my\\r\\ndear, fur to be surprised,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe. And Biddy said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI ought to\\r\\nhave thought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d They were both so\\r\\noverjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to\\r\\nthem, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their day\\r\\ncomplete!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never breathed\\r\\nthis last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he was with me in my\\r\\nillness, had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have been his\\r\\nknowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another hour!\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear Biddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou have the best husband in the whole world,\\r\\nand if you could have seen him by my bed you would have--But no, you\\r\\ncouldn't love him better than you do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, I couldn't indeed,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she will\\r\\nmake you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble Joe!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve before\\r\\nhis eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are in\\r\\ncharity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you\\r\\nhave done for me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I say that I am\\r\\ngoing away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I shall\\r\\nnever rest until I have worked for the money with which you have kept me\\r\\nout of prison, and have sent it to you, don't think, dear Joe and Biddy,\\r\\nthat if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose I could cancel\\r\\na farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so if I could!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut I must say more. Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love,\\r\\nand that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter\\r\\nnight, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for\\r\\never. Don't tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don't tell him, Biddy,\\r\\nthat I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honored you both,\\r\\nbecause you were both so good and true, and that, as your child, I said\\r\\nit would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I did.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI ain't a going,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe, from behind his sleeve, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto tell him\\r\\nnothink o' that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain't. Nor yet no one ain't.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind\\r\\nhearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear you\\r\\nsay the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and then\\r\\nI shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better of\\r\\nme, in the time to come!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO dear old Pip, old chap,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGod knows as I forgive you, if I\\r\\nhave anythink to forgive!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAmen! And God knows I do!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d echoed Biddy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few\\r\\nminutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go\\r\\nwith me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say\\r\\ngood-bye!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nI sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition\\r\\nwith my creditors,--who gave me ample time to pay them in full,--and I\\r\\nwent out and joined Herbert. Within a month, I had quitted England,\\r\\nand within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within four\\r\\nmonths I assumed my first undivided responsibility. For the beam across\\r\\nthe parlor ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under\\r\\nold Bill Barley's growls and was at peace, and Herbert had gone away to\\r\\nmarry Clara, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until\\r\\nhe brought her back.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany a year went round before I was a partner in the House; but I lived\\r\\nhappily with Herbert and his wife, and lived frugally, and paid my\\r\\ndebts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe. It\\r\\nwas not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me to\\r\\nHerbert; but he then declared that the secret of Herbert's partnership\\r\\nhad been long enough upon his conscience, and he must tell it. So he\\r\\ntold it, and Herbert was as much moved as amazed, and the dear fellow\\r\\nand I were not the worse friends for the long concealment. I must not\\r\\nleave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House, or that we made\\r\\nmints of money. We were not in a grand way of business, but we had a\\r\\ngood name, and worked for our profits, and did very well. We owed so\\r\\nmuch to Herbert's ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often\\r\\nwondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude, until I\\r\\nwas one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude\\r\\nhad never been in him at all, but had been in me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LIX\\r\\n\\r\\nFor eleven years, I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily\\r\\neyes,--though they had both been often before my fancy in the\\r\\nEast,--when, upon an evening in December, an hour or two after dark, I\\r\\nlaid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door. I touched it\\r\\nso softly that I was not heard, and looked in unseen. There, smoking his\\r\\npipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight, as hale and as strong as\\r\\never, though a little gray, sat Joe; and there, fenced into the corner\\r\\nwith Joe's leg, and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire,\\r\\nwas--I again!\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe giv' him the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joe,\\r\\ndelighted, when I took another stool by the child's side (but I did not\\r\\nrumple his hair), Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand we hoped he might grow a little bit like you, and\\r\\nwe think he do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought so too, and I took him out for a walk next morning, and we\\r\\ntalked immensely, understanding one another to perfection. And I took\\r\\nhim down to the churchyard, and set him on a certain tombstone there,\\r\\nand he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the\\r\\nmemory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife\\r\\nof the Above.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBiddy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, when I talked with her after dinner, as her little girl\\r\\nlay sleeping in her lap, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou must give Pip to me one of these days; or\\r\\nlend him, at all events.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy, gently. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou must marry.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo Herbert and Clara say, but I don't think I shall, Biddy. I have so\\r\\nsettled down in their home, that it's not at all likely. I am already\\r\\nquite an old bachelor.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBiddy looked down at her child, and put its little hand to her lips, and\\r\\nthen put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine.\\r\\nThere was something in the action, and in the light pressure of Biddy's\\r\\nwedding-ring, that had a very pretty eloquence in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear Pip,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Biddy, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou are sure you don't fret for her?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cO no,--I think not, Biddy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTell me as an old, old friend. Have you quite forgotten her?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear Biddy, I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a\\r\\nforemost place there, and little that ever had any place there. But that\\r\\npoor dream, as I once used to call it, has all gone by, Biddy,--all gone\\r\\nby!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, I knew, while I said those words, that I secretly intended\\r\\nto revisit the site of the old house that evening, alone, for her sake.\\r\\nYes, even so. For Estella's sake.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life, and as being\\r\\nseparated from her husband, who had used her with great cruelty, and who\\r\\nhad become quite renowned as a compound of pride, avarice, brutality,\\r\\nand meanness. And I had heard of the death of her husband, from an\\r\\naccident consequent on his ill-treatment of a horse. This release had\\r\\nbefallen her some two years before; for anything I knew, she was married\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early dinner hour at Joe's, left me abundance of time, without\\r\\nhurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before dark.\\r\\nBut, what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think\\r\\nof old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no house now, no brewery, no building whatever left, but the\\r\\nwall of the old garden. The cleared space had been enclosed with a rough\\r\\nfence, and looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy had struck\\r\\nroot anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin. A gate in\\r\\nthe fence standing ajar, I pushed it open, and went in.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was not yet\\r\\nup to scatter it. But, the stars were shining beyond the mist, and the\\r\\nmoon was coming, and the evening was not dark. I could trace out where\\r\\nevery part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been,\\r\\nand where the gates, and where the casks. I had done so, and was looking\\r\\nalong the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figure in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been moving\\r\\ntowards me, but it stood still. As I drew nearer, I saw it to be the\\r\\nfigure of a woman. As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away, when\\r\\nit stopped, and let me come up with it. Then, it faltered, as if much\\r\\nsurprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEstella!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am greatly changed. I wonder you know me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe freshness of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable\\r\\nmajesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it,\\r\\nI had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened,\\r\\nsoftened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before was\\r\\nthe friendly touch of the once insensible hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAfter so many years,\\r\\nit is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where our\\r\\nfirst meeting was! Do you often come back?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have never been here since.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNor I.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white\\r\\nceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and I thought of\\r\\nthe pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had heard on\\r\\nearth.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been\\r\\nprevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and\\r\\nthe same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes. Not knowing\\r\\nthat I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, she said\\r\\nquietly,--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWere you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in this\\r\\ncondition?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Estella.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have not\\r\\nrelinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I\\r\\nhave kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I\\r\\nmade in all the wretched years.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs it to be built on?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And\\r\\nyou,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou\\r\\nlive abroad still?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cStill.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd do well, I am sure?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore--yes, I do\\r\\nwell.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have often thought of you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far from me\\r\\nthe remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant\\r\\nof its worth. But since my duty has not been incompatible with the\\r\\nadmission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou have always held your place in my heart,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we were silent again until she spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI little thought,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat I should take leave of you in\\r\\ntaking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGlad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me,\\r\\nthe remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut you said to me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d returned Estella, very earnestly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9c'God bless you,\\r\\nGod forgive you!' And if you could say that to me then, you will not\\r\\nhesitate to say that to me now,--now, when suffering has been stronger\\r\\nthan all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart\\r\\nused to be. I have been bent and broken, but--I hope--into a better\\r\\nshape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me we are\\r\\nfriends.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe are friends,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose from\\r\\nthe bench.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd will continue friends apart,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Estella.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as\\r\\nthe morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so the\\r\\nevening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil\\r\\nlight they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GREAT EXPECTATIONS ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 1400-0.txt or 1400-0.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/4/0/1400/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\r\\nwill be renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\r\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\r\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\r\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the Ã¢\\x80\\x9cRight\\r\\nof Replacement or RefundÃ¢\\x80\\x9d described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\\r\\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\\r\\nfees.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\r\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\r\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\\r\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\\r\\npage at http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\r\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\""

Perhaps a\\r\\nfifth part of her mind was thus occupied, and the remaining parts leapt\\r\\nover the little barrier of day which interposed between Monday morning\\r\\nand this rather subdued moment, and played with the things one does\\r\\nvoluntarily and normally in the daylight. But although she was silent,\\r\\nshe was evidently mistress of a situation which was familiar enough to\\r\\nher, and inclined to let it take its way for the six hundredth time,\\r\\nperhaps, without bringing into play any of her unoccupied faculties. A\\r\\nsingle glance was enough to show that Mrs. Hilbery was so rich in the\\r\\ngifts which make tea-parties of elderly distinguished people successful,\\r\\nthat she scarcely needed any help from her daughter, provided that the\\r\\ntiresome business of teacups and bread and butter was discharged for\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering that the little party had been seated round the tea-table\\r\\nfor less than twenty minutes, the animation observable on their faces,\\r\\nand the amount of sound they were producing collectively, were very\\r\\ncreditable to the hostess. It suddenly came into KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mind that\\r\\nif some one opened the door at this moment he would think that they were\\r\\nenjoying themselves; he would think, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat an extremely nice house\\r\\nto come into!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and instinctively she laughed, and said something to\\r\\nincrease the noise, for the credit of the house presumably, since she\\r\\nherself had not been feeling exhilarated. At the very same moment,\\r\\nrather to her amusement, the door was flung open, and a young man\\r\\nentered the room. Katharine, as she shook hands with him, asked him,\\r\\nin her own mind, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow, do you think weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re enjoying ourselves\\r\\nenormously?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d... Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Denham, mother,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said aloud, for she saw that\\r\\nher mother had forgotten his name.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat fact was perceptible to Mr. Denham also, and increased the\\r\\nawkwardness which inevitably attends the entrance of a stranger into a\\r\\nroom full of people much at their ease, and all launched upon sentences.\\r\\nAt the same time, it seemed to Mr. Denham as if a thousand softly padded\\r\\ndoors had closed between him and the street outside. A fine mist, the\\r\\netherealized essence of the fog, hung visibly in the wide and rather\\r\\nempty space of the drawing-room, all silver where the candles were\\r\\ngrouped on the tea-table, and ruddy again in the firelight. With\\r\\nthe omnibuses and cabs still running in his head, and his body still\\r\\ntingling with his quick walk along the streets and in and out of traffic\\r\\nand foot-passengers, this drawing-room seemed very remote and still;\\r\\nand the faces of the elderly people were mellowed, at some distance from\\r\\neach other, and had a bloom on them owing to the fact that the air in\\r\\nthe drawing-room was thickened by blue grains of mist. Mr. Denham had\\r\\ncome in as Mr. Fortescue, the eminent novelist, reached the middle of a\\r\\nvery long sentence. He kept this suspended while the newcomer sat down,\\r\\nand Mrs. Hilbery deftly joined the severed parts by leaning towards him\\r\\nand remarking:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, what would you do if you were married to an engineer, and had to\\r\\nlive in Manchester, Mr. Denham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSurely she could learn Persian,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d broke in a thin, elderly gentleman.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs there no retired schoolmaster or man of letters in Manchester with\\r\\nwhom she could read Persian?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA cousin of ours has married and gone to live in Manchester,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine\\r\\nexplained. Mr. Denham muttered something, which was indeed all that\\r\\nwas required of him, and the novelist went on where he had left off.\\r\\nPrivately, Mr. Denham cursed himself very sharply for having exchanged\\r\\nthe freedom of the street for this sophisticated drawing-room, where,\\r\\namong other disagreeables, he certainly would not appear at his best. He\\r\\nglanced round him, and saw that, save for Katharine, they were all over\\r\\nforty, the only consolation being that Mr. Fortescue was a considerable\\r\\ncelebrity, so that to-morrow one might be glad to have met him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you ever been to Manchester?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNever,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy do you object to it, then?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine stirred her tea, and seemed to speculate, so Denham thought,\\r\\nupon the duty of filling somebody elseÃ¢\\x80\\x99s cup, but she was really\\r\\nwondering how she was going to keep this strange young man in harmony\\r\\nwith the rest. She observed that he was compressing his teacup, so that\\r\\nthere was danger lest the thin china might cave inwards. She could see\\r\\nthat he was nervous; one would expect a bony young man with his face\\r\\nslightly reddened by the wind, and his hair not altogether smooth, to\\r\\nbe nervous in such a party. Further, he probably disliked this kind of\\r\\nthing, and had come out of curiosity, or because her father had invited\\r\\nhim--anyhow, he would not be easily combined with the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should think there would be no one to talk to in Manchester,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nreplied at random. Mr. Fortescue had been observing her for a moment or\\r\\ntwo, as novelists are inclined to observe, and at this remark he smiled,\\r\\nand made it the text for a little further speculation.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn spite of a slight tendency to exaggeration, Katharine decidedly\\r\\nhits the mark,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, and lying back in his chair, with his opaque\\r\\ncontemplative eyes fixed on the ceiling, and the tips of his fingers\\r\\npressed together, he depicted, first the horrors of the streets of\\r\\nManchester, and then the bare, immense moors on the outskirts of the\\r\\ntown, and then the scrubby little house in which the girl would live,\\r\\nand then the professors and the miserable young students devoted to the\\r\\nmore strenuous works of our younger dramatists, who would visit her,\\r\\nand how her appearance would change by degrees, and how she would fly to\\r\\nLondon, and how Katharine would have to lead her about, as one leads an\\r\\neager dog on a chain, past rows of clamorous butchersÃ¢\\x80\\x99 shops, poor dear\\r\\ncreature.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, Mr. Fortescue,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery, as he finished, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI had just\\r\\nwritten to say how I envied her! I was thinking of the big gardens and\\r\\nthe dear old ladies in mittens, who read nothing but the Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSpectator,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n and snuff the candles. Have they ALL disappeared? I told her she would\\r\\nfind the nice things of London without the horrid streets that depress\\r\\none so.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere is the University,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the thin gentleman, who had previously\\r\\ninsisted upon the existence of people knowing Persian.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI know there are moors there, because I read about them in a book the\\r\\nother day,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am grieved and amazed at the ignorance of my family,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hilbery\\r\\nremarked. He was an elderly man, with a pair of oval, hazel eyes which\\r\\nwere rather bright for his time of life, and relieved the heaviness of\\r\\nhis face. He played constantly with a little green stone attached to his\\r\\nwatch-chain, thus displaying long and very sensitive fingers, and had\\r\\na habit of moving his head hither and thither very quickly without\\r\\naltering the position of his large and rather corpulent body, so that he\\r\\nseemed to be providing himself incessantly with food for amusement and\\r\\nreflection with the least possible expenditure of energy. One might\\r\\nsuppose that he had passed the time of life when his ambitions were\\r\\npersonal, or that he had gratified them as far as he was likely to\\r\\ndo, and now employed his considerable acuteness rather to observe and\\r\\nreflect than to attain any result.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine, so Denham decided, while Mr. Fortescue built up another\\r\\nrounded structure of words, had a likeness to each of her parents, but\\r\\nthese elements were rather oddly blended. She had the quick, impulsive\\r\\nmovements of her mother, the lips parting often to speak, and closing\\r\\nagain; and the dark oval eyes of her father brimming with light upon\\r\\na basis of sadness, or, since she was too young to have acquired a\\r\\nsorrowful point of view, one might say that the basis was not sadness so\\r\\nmuch as a spirit given to contemplation and self-control. Judging by her\\r\\nhair, her coloring, and the shape of her features, she was striking,\\r\\nif not actually beautiful. Decision and composure stamped her, a\\r\\ncombination of qualities that produced a very marked character, and one\\r\\nthat was not calculated to put a young man, who scarcely knew her, at\\r\\nhis ease. For the rest, she was tall; her dress was of some quiet color,\\r\\nwith old yellow-tinted lace for ornament, to which the spark of an\\r\\nancient jewel gave its one red gleam. Denham noticed that, although\\r\\nsilent, she kept sufficient control of the situation to answer\\r\\nimmediately her mother appealed to her for help, and yet it was obvious\\r\\nto him that she attended only with the surface skin of her mind. It\\r\\nstruck him that her position at the tea-table, among all these elderly\\r\\npeople, was not without its difficulties, and he checked his inclination\\r\\nto find her, or her attitude, generally antipathetic to him. The talk\\r\\nhad passed over Manchester, after dealing with it very generously.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWould it be the Battle of Trafalgar or the Spanish Armada, Katharine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n her mother demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTrafalgar, mother.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTrafalgar, of course! How stupid of me! Another cup of tea, with a thin\\r\\nslice of lemon in it, and then, dear Mr. Fortescue, please explain my\\r\\nabsurd little puzzle. One canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t help believing gentlemen with Roman\\r\\nnoses, even if one meets them in omnibuses.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hilbery here interposed so far as Denham was concerned, and talked\\r\\na great deal of sense about the solicitorsÃ¢\\x80\\x99 profession, and the changes\\r\\nwhich he had seen in his lifetime. Indeed, Denham properly fell to his\\r\\nlot, owing to the fact that an article by Denham upon some legal matter,\\r\\npublished by Mr. Hilbery in his Review, had brought them acquainted. But\\r\\nwhen a moment later Mrs. Sutton Bailey was announced, he turned to her,\\r\\nand Mr. Denham found himself sitting silent, rejecting possible things\\r\\nto say, beside Katharine, who was silent too. Being much about the same\\r\\nage and both under thirty, they were prohibited from the use of a great\\r\\nmany convenient phrases which launch conversation into smooth waters.\\r\\nThey were further silenced by KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s rather malicious determination\\r\\nnot to help this young man, in whose upright and resolute bearing she\\r\\ndetected something hostile to her surroundings, by any of the usual\\r\\nfeminine amenities. They therefore sat silent, Denham controlling his\\r\\ndesire to say something abrupt and explosive, which should shock her\\r\\ninto life. But Mrs. Hilbery was immediately sensitive to any silence\\r\\nin the drawing-room, as of a dumb note in a sonorous scale, and leaning\\r\\nacross the table she observed, in the curiously tentative detached\\r\\nmanner which always gave her phrases the likeness of butterflies\\r\\nflaunting from one sunny spot to another, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDÃ¢\\x80\\x99you know, Mr. Denham, you\\r\\nremind me so much of dear Mr. Ruskin.... Is it his tie, Katharine, or\\r\\nhis hair, or the way he sits in his chair? Do tell me, Mr. Denham, are\\r\\nyou an admirer of Ruskin? Some one, the other day, said to me, Ã¢\\x80\\x98Oh, no,\\r\\nwe donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t read Ruskin, Mrs. Hilbery.Ã¢\\x80\\x99 What DO you read, I wonder?--for\\r\\nyou canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t spend all your time going up in aeroplanes and burrowing into\\r\\nthe bowels of the earth.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked benevolently at Denham, who said nothing articulate, and\\r\\nthen at Katharine, who smiled but said nothing either, upon which Mrs.\\r\\nHilbery seemed possessed by a brilliant idea, and exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure Mr. Denham would like to see our things, Katharine. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure\\r\\nheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not like that dreadful young man, Mr. Ponting, who told me that he\\r\\nconsidered it our duty to live exclusively in the present. After all,\\r\\nwhat IS the present? Half of itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the past, and the better half, too, I\\r\\nshould say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, turning to Mr. Fortescue.\\r\\n\\r\\nDenham rose, half meaning to go, and thinking that he had seen all that\\r\\nthere was to see, but Katharine rose at the same moment, and saying,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you would like to see the pictures,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d led the way across the\\r\\ndrawing-room to a smaller room opening out of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe smaller room was something like a chapel in a cathedral, or a\\r\\ngrotto in a cave, for the booming sound of the traffic in the distance\\r\\nsuggested the soft surge of waters, and the oval mirrors, with their\\r\\nsilver surface, were like deep pools trembling beneath starlight. But\\r\\nthe comparison to a religious temple of some kind was the more apt of\\r\\nthe two, for the little room was crowded with relics.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Katharine touched different spots, lights sprang here and there, and\\r\\nrevealed a square mass of red-and-gold books, and then a long skirt\\r\\nin blue-and-white paint lustrous behind glass, and then a mahogany\\r\\nwriting-table, with its orderly equipment, and, finally, a picture above\\r\\nthe table, to which special illumination was accorded. When Katharine\\r\\nhad touched these last lights, she stood back, as much as to say,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham found himself looked down upon by the eyes of the great\\r\\npoet, Richard Alardyce, and suffered a little shock which would have led\\r\\nhim, had he been wearing a hat, to remove it. The eyes looked at him out\\r\\nof the mellow pinks and yellows of the paint with divine friendliness,\\r\\nwhich embraced him, and passed on to contemplate the entire world. The\\r\\npaint had so faded that very little but the beautiful large eyes were\\r\\nleft, dark in the surrounding dimness.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine waited as though for him to receive a full impression, and\\r\\nthen she said:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is his writing-table. He used this pen,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and she lifted a quill\\r\\npen and laid it down again. The writing-table was splashed with old ink,\\r\\nand the pen disheveled in service. There lay the gigantic gold-rimmed\\r\\nspectacles, ready to his hand, and beneath the table was a pair of\\r\\nlarge, worn slippers, one of which Katharine picked up, remarking:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think my grandfather must have been at least twice as large as any\\r\\none is nowadays. This,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went on, as if she knew what she had to say\\r\\nby heart, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis the original manuscript of the Ã¢\\x80\\x98Ode to Winter.Ã¢\\x80\\x99 The early\\r\\npoems are far less corrected than the later. Would you like to look at\\r\\nit?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Mr. Denham examined the manuscript, she glanced up at her\\r\\ngrandfather, and, for the thousandth time, fell into a pleasant dreamy\\r\\nstate in which she seemed to be the companion of those giant men, of\\r\\ntheir own lineage, at any rate, and the insignificant present moment was\\r\\nput to shame. That magnificent ghostly head on the canvas, surely, never\\r\\nbeheld all the trivialities of a Sunday afternoon, and it did not seem\\r\\nto matter what she and this young man said to each other, for they were\\r\\nonly small people.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is a copy of the first edition of the poems,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued,\\r\\nwithout considering the fact that Mr. Denham was still occupied with the\\r\\nmanuscript, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhich contains several poems that have not been reprinted,\\r\\nas well as corrections.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She paused for a minute, and then went on, as\\r\\nif these spaces had all been calculated.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat lady in blue is my great-grandmother, by Millington. Here is my\\r\\nuncleÃ¢\\x80\\x99s walking-stick--he was Sir Richard Warburton, you know, and rode\\r\\nwith Havelock to the Relief of Lucknow. And then, let me see--oh, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nthe original Alardyce, 1697, the founder of the family fortunes, with\\r\\nhis wife. Some one gave us this bowl the other day because it has their\\r\\ncrest and initials. We think it must have been given them to celebrate\\r\\ntheir silver wedding-day.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere she stopped for a moment, wondering why it was that Mr. Denham said\\r\\nnothing. Her feeling that he was antagonistic to her, which had lapsed\\r\\nwhile she thought of her family possessions, returned so keenly that\\r\\nshe stopped in the middle of her catalog and looked at him. Her mother,\\r\\nwishing to connect him reputably with the great dead, had compared him\\r\\nwith Mr. Ruskin; and the comparison was in KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mind, and led\\r\\nher to be more critical of the young man than was fair, for a young man\\r\\npaying a call in a tail-coat is in a different element altogether from\\r\\na head seized at its climax of expressiveness, gazing immutably from\\r\\nbehind a sheet of glass, which was all that remained to her of Mr.\\r\\nRuskin. He had a singular face--a face built for swiftness and decision\\r\\nrather than for massive contemplation; the forehead broad, the nose long\\r\\nand formidable, the lips clean-shaven and at once dogged and sensitive,\\r\\nthe cheeks lean, with a deeply running tide of red blood in them. His\\r\\neyes, expressive now of the usual masculine impersonality and authority,\\r\\nmight reveal more subtle emotions under favorable circumstances, for\\r\\nthey were large, and of a clear, brown color; they seemed unexpectedly\\r\\nto hesitate and speculate; but Katharine only looked at him to wonder\\r\\nwhether his face would not have come nearer the standard of her dead\\r\\nheroes if it had been adorned with side-whiskers. In his spare build\\r\\nand thin, though healthy, cheeks, she saw tokens of an angular and acrid\\r\\nsoul. His voice, she noticed, had a slight vibrating or creaking sound\\r\\nin it, as he laid down the manuscript and said:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou must be very proud of your family, Miss Hilbery.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I am,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine answered, and she added, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo you think thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nanything wrong in that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWrong? How should it be wrong? It must be a bore, though, showing your\\r\\nthings to visitors,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added reflectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot if the visitors like them.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIsnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it difficult to live up to your ancestors?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he proceeded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI dare say I shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t try to write poetry,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. And thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what I should hate. I couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t bear my grandfather\\r\\nto cut me out. And, after all,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham went on, glancing round him\\r\\nsatirically, as Katharine thought, Ã¢\\x80\\x9citÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not your grandfather only.\\r\\nYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re cut out all the way round. I suppose you come of one of the most\\r\\ndistinguished families in England. There are the Warburtons and the\\r\\nMannings--and youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re related to the Otways, arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you? I read it all in\\r\\nsome magazine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe Otways are my cousins,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Denham, in a final tone of voice, as if his argument were\\r\\nproved.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see that youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve proved anything.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDenham smiled, in a peculiarly provoking way. He was amused and\\r\\ngratified to find that he had the power to annoy his oblivious,\\r\\nsupercilious hostess, if he could not impress her; though he would have\\r\\npreferred to impress her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat silent, holding the precious little book of poems unopened in\\r\\nhis hands, and Katharine watched him, the melancholy or contemplative\\r\\nexpression deepening in her eyes as her annoyance faded. She appeared to\\r\\nbe considering many things. She had forgotten her duties.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Denham again, suddenly opening the little book of poems,\\r\\nas though he had said all that he meant to say or could, with propriety,\\r\\nsay. He turned over the pages with great decision, as if he were judging\\r\\nthe book in its entirety, the printing and paper and binding, as well\\r\\nas the poetry, and then, having satisfied himself of its good or bad\\r\\nquality, he placed it on the writing-table, and examined the malacca\\r\\ncane with the gold knob which had belonged to the soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you proud of your family?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Denham. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWeÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve never done anything to be proud of--unless you\\r\\ncount paying oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s bills a matter for pride.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat sounds rather dull,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou would think us horribly dull,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham agreed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I might find you dull, but I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think I should find you\\r\\nridiculous,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine added, as if Denham had actually brought that\\r\\ncharge against her family.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo--because weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not in the least ridiculous. WeÃ¢\\x80\\x99re a respectable\\r\\nmiddle-class family, living at Highgate.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t live at Highgate, but weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re middle class too, I suppose.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDenham merely smiled, and replacing the malacca cane on the rack, he\\r\\ndrew a sword from its ornamental sheath.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat belonged to Clive, so we say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, taking up her\\r\\nduties as hostess again automatically.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs it a lie?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a family tradition. I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know that we can prove it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou see, we donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have traditions in our family,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Denham.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou sound very dull,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine remarked, for the second time.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMerely middle class,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou pay your bills, and you speak the truth. I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see why you should\\r\\ndespise us.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Denham carefully sheathed the sword which the Hilberys said belonged\\r\\nto Clive.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like to be you; thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all I said,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied, as if he\\r\\nwere saying what he thought as accurately as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, but one never would like to be any one else.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should. I should like to be lots of other people.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen why not us?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nDenham looked at her as she sat in her grandfatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s arm-chair, drawing\\r\\nher great-uncleÃ¢\\x80\\x99s malacca cane smoothly through her fingers, while her\\r\\nbackground was made up equally of lustrous blue-and-white paint, and\\r\\ncrimson books with gilt lines on them. The vitality and composure of\\r\\nher attitude, as of a bright-plumed bird poised easily before further\\r\\nflights, roused him to show her the limitations of her lot. So soon, so\\r\\neasily, would he be forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll never know anything at first hand,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he began, almost savagely.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all been done for you. YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll never know the pleasure of buying\\r\\nthings after saving up for them, or reading books for the first time, or\\r\\nmaking discoveries.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGo on,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine observed, as he paused, suddenly doubtful, when he\\r\\nheard his voice proclaiming aloud these facts, whether there was any\\r\\ntruth in them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf course, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know how you spend your time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he continued, a\\r\\nlittle stiffly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I suppose you have to show people round. You\\r\\nare writing a life of your grandfather, arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you? And this kind of\\r\\nthingÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--he nodded towards the other room, where they could hear bursts\\r\\nof cultivated laughter--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmust take up a lot of time.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him expectantly, as if between them they were decorating\\r\\na small figure of herself, and she saw him hesitating in the disposition\\r\\nof some bow or sash.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got it very nearly right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I only help my mother.\\r\\nI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t write myself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you do anything yourself?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t leave the house at ten and come\\r\\nback at six.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mean that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Denham had recovered his self-control; he spoke with a quietness\\r\\nwhich made Katharine rather anxious that he should explain himself, but\\r\\nat the same time she wished to annoy him, to waft him away from her on\\r\\nsome light current of ridicule or satire, as she was wont to do with\\r\\nthese intermittent young men of her fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNobody ever does do anything worth doing nowadays,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she remarked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\nseeÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--she tapped the volume of her grandfatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s poems--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\neven print as well as they did, and as for poets or painters or\\r\\nnovelists--there are none; so, at any rate, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not singular.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, we havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t any great men,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m very glad that we\\r\\nhavenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t. I hate great men. The worship of greatness in the nineteenth\\r\\ncentury seems to me to explain the worthlessness of that generation.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine opened her lips and drew in her breath, as if to reply with\\r\\nequal vigor, when the shutting of a door in the next room withdrew her\\r\\nattention, and they both became conscious that the voices, which had\\r\\nbeen rising and falling round the tea-table, had fallen silent; the\\r\\nlight, even, seemed to have sunk lower. A moment later Mrs. Hilbery\\r\\nappeared in the doorway of the ante-room. She stood looking at them with\\r\\na smile of expectancy on her face, as if a scene from the drama of\\r\\nthe younger generation were being played for her benefit. She was a\\r\\nremarkable-looking woman, well advanced in the sixties, but owing to the\\r\\nlightness of her frame and the brightness of her eyes she seemed to have\\r\\nbeen wafted over the surface of the years without taking much harm\\r\\nin the passage. Her face was shrunken and aquiline, but any hint of\\r\\nsharpness was dispelled by the large blue eyes, at once sagacious and\\r\\ninnocent, which seemed to regard the world with an enormous desire that\\r\\nit should behave itself nobly, and an entire confidence that it could do\\r\\nso, if it would only take the pains.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain lines on the broad forehead and about the lips might be taken to\\r\\nsuggest that she had known moments of some difficulty and perplexity in\\r\\nthe course of her career, but these had not destroyed her trustfulness,\\r\\nand she was clearly still prepared to give every one any number of fresh\\r\\nchances and the whole system the benefit of the doubt. She wore a great\\r\\nresemblance to her father, and suggested, as he did, the fresh airs and\\r\\nopen spaces of a younger world.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow do you like our things, Mr. Denham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Denham rose, put his book down, opened his mouth, but said nothing,\\r\\nas Katharine observed, with some amusement.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery handled the book he had laid down.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere are some books that LIVE,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she mused. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThey are young with us,\\r\\nand they grow old with us. Are you fond of poetry, Mr. Denham? But what\\r\\nan absurd question to ask! The truth is, dear Mr. Fortescue has almost\\r\\ntired me out. He is so eloquent and so witty, so searching and so\\r\\nprofound that, after half an hour or so, I feel inclined to turn out all\\r\\nthe lights. But perhaps heÃ¢\\x80\\x99d be more wonderful than ever in the dark.\\r\\nWhat dÃ¢\\x80\\x99you think, Katharine? Shall we give a little party in complete\\r\\ndarkness? ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99d have to be bright rooms for the bores....Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Mr. Denham held out his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve any number of things to show you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed,\\r\\ntaking no notice of it. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBooks, pictures, china, manuscripts, and the\\r\\nvery chair that Mary Queen of Scots sat in when she heard of DarnleyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmurder. I must lie down for a little, and Katharine must change her\\r\\ndress (though sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s wearing a very pretty one), but if you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mind\\r\\nbeing left alone, supper will be at eight. I dare say youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll write a\\r\\npoem of your own while youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re waiting. Ah, how I love the firelight!\\r\\nDoesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t our room look charming?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stepped back and bade them contemplate the empty drawing-room, with\\r\\nits rich, irregular lights, as the flames leapt and wavered.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear things!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDear chairs and tables! How like old\\r\\nfriends they are--faithful, silent friends. Which reminds me, Katharine,\\r\\nlittle Mr. Anning is coming to-night, and Tite Street, and Cadogan\\r\\nSquare.... Do remember to get that drawing of your great-uncle glazed.\\r\\nAunt Millicent remarked it last time she was here, and I know how it\\r\\nwould hurt me to see MY father in a broken glass.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was like tearing through a maze of diamond-glittering spidersÃ¢\\x80\\x99 webs\\r\\nto say good-bye and escape, for at each movement Mrs. Hilbery remembered\\r\\nsomething further about the villainies of picture-framers or the\\r\\ndelights of poetry, and at one time it seemed to the young man that he\\r\\nwould be hypnotized into doing what she pretended to want him to do,\\r\\nfor he could not suppose that she attached any value whatever to his\\r\\npresence. Katharine, however, made an opportunity for him to leave, and\\r\\nfor that he was grateful to her, as one young person is grateful for the\\r\\nunderstanding of another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man shut the door with a sharper slam than any visitor had\\r\\nused that afternoon, and walked up the street at a great pace, cutting\\r\\nthe air with his walking-stick. He was glad to find himself outside that\\r\\ndrawing-room, breathing raw fog, and in contact with unpolished people\\r\\nwho only wanted their share of the pavement allowed them. He thought\\r\\nthat if he had had Mr. or Mrs. or Miss Hilbery out here he would have\\r\\nmade them, somehow, feel his superiority, for he was chafed by the\\r\\nmemory of halting awkward sentences which had failed to give even the\\r\\nyoung woman with the sad, but inwardly ironical eyes a hint of his\\r\\nforce. He tried to recall the actual words of his little outburst,\\r\\nand unconsciously supplemented them by so many words of greater\\r\\nexpressiveness that the irritation of his failure was somewhat assuaged.\\r\\nSudden stabs of the unmitigated truth assailed him now and then, for he\\r\\nwas not inclined by nature to take a rosy view of his conduct, but\\r\\nwhat with the beat of his foot upon the pavement, and the glimpse\\r\\nwhich half-drawn curtains offered him of kitchens, dining-rooms, and\\r\\ndrawing-rooms, illustrating with mute power different scenes from\\r\\ndifferent lives, his own experience lost its sharpness.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis own experience underwent a curious change. His speed slackened, his\\r\\nhead sank a little towards his breast, and the lamplight shone now and\\r\\nagain upon a face grown strangely tranquil. His thought was so absorbing\\r\\nthat when it became necessary to verify the name of a street, he looked\\r\\nat it for a time before he read it; when he came to a crossing, he\\r\\nseemed to have to reassure himself by two or three taps, such as a blind\\r\\nman gives, upon the curb; and, reaching the Underground station, he\\r\\nblinked in the bright circle of light, glanced at his watch, decided\\r\\nthat he might still indulge himself in darkness, and walked straight on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet the thought was the thought with which he had started. He was\\r\\nstill thinking about the people in the house which he had left; but\\r\\ninstead of remembering, with whatever accuracy he could, their looks and\\r\\nsayings, he had consciously taken leave of the literal truth. A turn of\\r\\nthe street, a firelit room, something monumental in the procession\\r\\nof the lamp-posts, who shall say what accident of light or shape had\\r\\nsuddenly changed the prospect within his mind, and led him to murmur\\r\\naloud:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSheÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll do.... Yes, Katharine HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll do.... IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll take Katharine\\r\\nHilbery.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as he had said this, his pace slackened, his head fell, his eyes\\r\\nbecame fixed. The desire to justify himself, which had been so urgent,\\r\\nceased to torment him, and, as if released from constraint, so that\\r\\nthey worked without friction or bidding, his faculties leapt forward and\\r\\nfixed, as a matter of course, upon the form of Katharine Hilbery. It was\\r\\nmarvellous how much they found to feed upon, considering the destructive\\r\\nnature of DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s criticism in her presence. The charm, which he had\\r\\ntried to disown, when under the effect of it, the beauty, the character,\\r\\nthe aloofness, which he had been determined not to feel, now possessed\\r\\nhim wholly; and when, as happened by the nature of things, he had\\r\\nexhausted his memory, he went on with his imagination. He was conscious\\r\\nof what he was about, for in thus dwelling upon Miss HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nqualities, he showed a kind of method, as if he required this vision of\\r\\nher for a particular purpose. He increased her height, he darkened\\r\\nher hair; but physically there was not much to change in her. His most\\r\\ndaring liberty was taken with her mind, which, for reasons of his own,\\r\\nhe desired to be exalted and infallible, and of such independence that\\r\\nit was only in the case of Ralph Denham that it swerved from its high,\\r\\nswift flight, but where he was concerned, though fastidious at first,\\r\\nshe finally swooped from her eminence to crown him with her approval.\\r\\nThese delicious details, however, were to be worked out in all their\\r\\nramifications at his leisure; the main point was that Katharine Hilbery\\r\\nwould do; she would do for weeks, perhaps for months. In taking her he\\r\\nhad provided himself with something the lack of which had left a\\r\\nbare place in his mind for a considerable time. He gave a sigh of\\r\\nsatisfaction; his consciousness of his actual position somewhere in the\\r\\nneighborhood of Knightsbridge returned to him, and he was soon speeding\\r\\nin the train towards Highgate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough thus supported by the knowledge of his new possession of\\r\\nconsiderable value, he was not proof against the familiar thoughts which\\r\\nthe suburban streets and the damp shrubs growing in front gardens\\r\\nand the absurd names painted in white upon the gates of those gardens\\r\\nsuggested to him. His walk was uphill, and his mind dwelt gloomily upon\\r\\nthe house which he approached, where he would find six or seven brothers\\r\\nand sisters, a widowed mother, and, probably, some aunt or uncle sitting\\r\\ndown to an unpleasant meal under a very bright light. Should he put in\\r\\nforce the threat which, two weeks ago, some such gathering had wrung\\r\\nfrom him--the terrible threat that if visitors came on Sunday he should\\r\\ndine alone in his room? A glance in the direction of Miss Hilbery\\r\\ndetermined him to make his stand this very night, and accordingly,\\r\\nhaving let himself in, having verified the presence of Uncle Joseph by\\r\\nmeans of a bowler hat and a very large umbrella, he gave his orders to\\r\\nthe maid, and went upstairs to his room.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went up a great many flights of stairs, and he noticed, as he had\\r\\nvery seldom noticed, how the carpet became steadily shabbier, until it\\r\\nceased altogether, how the walls were discolored, sometimes by cascades\\r\\nof damp, and sometimes by the outlines of picture-frames since removed,\\r\\nhow the paper flapped loose at the corners, and a great flake of plaster\\r\\nhad fallen from the ceiling. The room itself was a cheerless one to\\r\\nreturn to at this inauspicious hour. A flattened sofa would, later\\r\\nin the evening, become a bed; one of the tables concealed a washing\\r\\napparatus; his clothes and boots were disagreeably mixed with books\\r\\nwhich bore the gilt of college arms; and, for decoration, there\\r\\nhung upon the wall photographs of bridges and cathedrals and large,\\r\\nunprepossessing groups of insufficiently clothed young men, sitting in\\r\\nrows one above another upon stone steps. There was a look of meanness\\r\\nand shabbiness in the furniture and curtains, and nowhere any sign of\\r\\nluxury or even of a cultivated taste, unless the cheap classics in the\\r\\nbook-case were a sign of an effort in that direction. The only object\\r\\nthat threw any light upon the character of the roomÃ¢\\x80\\x99s owner was a large\\r\\nperch, placed in the window to catch the air and sun, upon which a tame\\r\\nand, apparently, decrepit rook hopped dryly from side to side. The bird,\\r\\nencouraged by a scratch behind the ear, settled upon DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s shoulder.\\r\\nHe lit his gas-fire and settled down in gloomy patience to await his\\r\\ndinner. After sitting thus for some minutes a small girl popped her head\\r\\nin to say,\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMother says, arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you coming down, Ralph? Uncle Joseph--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re to bring my dinner up here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph, peremptorily;\\r\\nwhereupon she vanished, leaving the door ajar in her haste to be gone.\\r\\nAfter Denham had waited some minutes, in the course of which neither\\r\\nhe nor the rook took their eyes off the fire, he muttered a curse, ran\\r\\ndownstairs, intercepted the parlor-maid, and cut himself a slice of\\r\\nbread and cold meat. As he did so, the dining-room door sprang open, a\\r\\nvoice exclaimed Ã¢\\x80\\x9cRalph!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but Ralph paid no attention to the voice, and\\r\\nmade off upstairs with his plate. He set it down in a chair opposite\\r\\nhim, and ate with a ferocity that was due partly to anger and partly to\\r\\nhunger. His mother, then, was determined not to respect his wishes; he\\r\\nwas a person of no importance in his own family; he was sent for and\\r\\ntreated as a child. He reflected, with a growing sense of injury, that\\r\\nalmost every one of his actions since opening the door of his room had\\r\\nbeen won from the grasp of the family system. By rights, he should have\\r\\nbeen sitting downstairs in the drawing-room describing his afternoonÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nadventures, or listening to the afternoonÃ¢\\x80\\x99s adventures of other people;\\r\\nthe room itself, the gas-fire, the arm-chair--all had been fought for;\\r\\nthe wretched bird, with half its feathers out and one leg lamed by a\\r\\ncat, had been rescued under protest; but what his family most resented,\\r\\nhe reflected, was his wish for privacy. To dine alone, or to sit alone\\r\\nafter dinner, was flat rebellion, to be fought with every weapon\\r\\nof underhand stealth or of open appeal. Which did he dislike\\r\\nmost--deception or tears? But, at any rate, they could not rob him of\\r\\nhis thoughts; they could not make him say where he had been or whom he\\r\\nhad seen. That was his own affair; that, indeed, was a step entirely in\\r\\nthe right direction, and, lighting his pipe, and cutting up the remains\\r\\nof his meal for the benefit of the rook, Ralph calmed his rather\\r\\nexcessive irritation and settled down to think over his prospects.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis particular afternoon was a step in the right direction, because it\\r\\nwas part of his plan to get to know people beyond the family circuit,\\r\\njust as it was part of his plan to learn German this autumn, and to\\r\\nreview legal books for Mr. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCritical Review.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He had always\\r\\nmade plans since he was a small boy; for poverty, and the fact that\\r\\nhe was the eldest son of a large family, had given him the habit of\\r\\nthinking of spring and summer, autumn and winter, as so many stages in a\\r\\nprolonged campaign. Although he was still under thirty, this forecasting\\r\\nhabit had marked two semicircular lines above his eyebrows, which\\r\\nthreatened, at this moment, to crease into their wonted shapes. But\\r\\ninstead of settling down to think, he rose, took a small piece of\\r\\ncardboard marked in large letters with the word OUT, and hung it\\r\\nupon the handle of his door. This done, he sharpened a pencil, lit a\\r\\nreading-lamp and opened his book. But still he hesitated to take his\\r\\nseat. He scratched the rook, he walked to the window; he parted the\\r\\ncurtains, and looked down upon the city which lay, hazily luminous,\\r\\nbeneath him. He looked across the vapors in the direction of Chelsea;\\r\\nlooked fixedly for a moment, and then returned to his chair. But the\\r\\nwhole thickness of some learned counselÃ¢\\x80\\x99s treatise upon Torts did not\\r\\nscreen him satisfactorily. Through the pages he saw a drawing-room,\\r\\nvery empty and spacious; he heard low voices, he saw womenÃ¢\\x80\\x99s figures, he\\r\\ncould even smell the scent of the cedar log which flamed in the grate.\\r\\nHis mind relaxed its tension, and seemed to be giving out now what\\r\\nit had taken in unconsciously at the time. He could remember Mr.\\r\\nFortescueÃ¢\\x80\\x99s exact words, and the rolling emphasis with which he\\r\\ndelivered them, and he began to repeat what Mr. Fortescue had said, in\\r\\nMr. FortescueÃ¢\\x80\\x99s own manner, about Manchester. His mind then began to\\r\\nwander about the house, and he wondered whether there were other rooms\\r\\nlike the drawing-room, and he thought, inconsequently, how beautiful the\\r\\nbathroom must be, and how leisurely it was--the life of these well-kept\\r\\npeople, who were, no doubt, still sitting in the same room, only they\\r\\nhad changed their clothes, and little Mr. Anning was there, and the aunt\\r\\nwho would mind if the glass of her fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s picture was broken. Miss\\r\\nHilbery had changed her dress (Ã¢\\x80\\x9calthough sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s wearing such a pretty\\r\\none,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he heard her mother say), and she was talking to Mr. Anning,\\r\\nwho was well over forty, and bald into the bargain, about books. How\\r\\npeaceful and spacious it was; and the peace possessed him so completely\\r\\nthat his muscles slackened, his book drooped from his hand, and he\\r\\nforgot that the hour of work was wasting minute by minute.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was roused by a creak upon the stair. With a guilty start he composed\\r\\nhimself, frowned and looked intently at the fifty-sixth page of his\\r\\nvolume. A step paused outside his door, and he knew that the person,\\r\\nwhoever it might be, was considering the placard, and debating whether\\r\\nto honor its decree or not. Certainly, policy advised him to sit still\\r\\nin autocratic silence, for no custom can take root in a family unless\\r\\nevery breach of it is punished severely for the first six months or so.\\r\\nBut Ralph was conscious of a distinct wish to be interrupted, and his\\r\\ndisappointment was perceptible when he heard the creaking sound rather\\r\\nfarther down the stairs, as if his visitor had decided to withdraw. He\\r\\nrose, opened the door with unnecessary abruptness, and waited on the\\r\\nlanding. The person stopped simultaneously half a flight downstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRalph?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said a voice, inquiringly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cJoan?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI was coming up, but I saw your notice.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, come along in, then.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He concealed his desire beneath a tone as\\r\\ngrudging as he could make it.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoan came in, but she was careful to show, by standing upright with\\r\\none hand upon the mantelpiece, that she was only there for a definite\\r\\npurpose, which discharged, she would go.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was older than Ralph by some three or four years. Her face was round\\r\\nbut worn, and expressed that tolerant but anxious good humor which is\\r\\nthe special attribute of elder sisters in large families. Her pleasant\\r\\nbrown eyes resembled RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s, save in expression, for whereas he seemed\\r\\nto look straightly and keenly at one object, she appeared to be in the\\r\\nhabit of considering everything from many different points of view. This\\r\\nmade her appear his elder by more years than existed in fact between\\r\\nthem. Her gaze rested for a moment or two upon the rook. She then said,\\r\\nwithout any preface:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s about Charles and Uncle JohnÃ¢\\x80\\x99s offer.... MotherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s been talking to\\r\\nme. She says she canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t afford to pay for him after this term. She says\\r\\nsheÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll have to ask for an overdraft as it is.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s simply not true,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. I thought not. But she wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe me when I say it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph, as if he could foresee the length of this familiar argument, drew\\r\\nup a chair for his sister and sat down himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not interrupting?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph shook his head, and for a time they sat silent. The lines curved\\r\\nthemselves in semicircles above their eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand that oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s got to take risks,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he observed,\\r\\nfinally.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI believe mother would take risks if she knew that Charles was the sort\\r\\nof boy to profit by it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s got brains, hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t he?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph. His tone had taken on that\\r\\nshade of pugnacity which suggested to his sister that some personal\\r\\ngrievance drove him to take the line he did. She wondered what it might\\r\\nbe, but at once recalled her mind, and assented.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn some ways heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s fearfully backward, though, compared with what you\\r\\nwere at his age. And heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s difficult at home, too. He makes Molly slave\\r\\nfor him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph made a sound which belittled this particular argument. It was\\r\\nplain to Joan that she had struck one of her brotherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s perverse moods,\\r\\nand he was going to oppose whatever his mother said. He called her\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cshe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d which was a proof of it. She sighed involuntarily, and the sigh\\r\\nannoyed Ralph, and he exclaimed with irritation:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s pretty hard lines to stick a boy into an office at seventeen!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNobody WANTS to stick him into an office,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe, too, was becoming annoyed. She had spent the whole of the afternoon\\r\\ndiscussing wearisome details of education and expense with her\\r\\nmother, and she had come to her brother for help, encouraged, rather\\r\\nirrationally, to expect help by the fact that he had been out somewhere,\\r\\nshe didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know and didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mean to ask where, all the afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph was fond of his sister, and her irritation made him think how\\r\\nunfair it was that all these burdens should be laid on her shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe truth is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he observed gloomily, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat I ought to have accepted\\r\\nUncle JohnÃ¢\\x80\\x99s offer. I should have been making six hundred a year by this\\r\\ntime.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think that for a moment,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joan replied quickly, repenting of\\r\\nher annoyance. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe question, to my mind, is, whether we couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t cut\\r\\ndown our expenses in some way.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA smaller house?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFewer servants, perhaps.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither brother nor sister spoke with much conviction, and after\\r\\nreflecting for a moment what these proposed reforms in a strictly\\r\\neconomical household meant, Ralph announced very decidedly:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s out of the question.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was out of the question that she should put any more household work\\r\\nupon herself. No, the hardship must fall on him, for he was determined\\r\\nthat his family should have as many chances of distinguishing themselves\\r\\nas other families had--as the Hilberys had, for example. He believed\\r\\nsecretly and rather defiantly, for it was a fact not capable of proof,\\r\\nthat there was something very remarkable about his family.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf mother wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t run risks--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou really canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t expect her to sell out again.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe ought to look upon it as an investment; but if she wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t, we must\\r\\nfind some other way, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA threat was contained in this sentence, and Joan knew, without asking,\\r\\nwhat the threat was. In the course of his professional life, which now\\r\\nextended over six or seven years, Ralph had saved, perhaps, three or\\r\\nfour hundred pounds. Considering the sacrifices he had made in order to\\r\\nput by this sum it always amazed Joan to find that he used it to gamble\\r\\nwith, buying shares and selling them again, increasing it sometimes,\\r\\nsometimes diminishing it, and always running the risk of losing every\\r\\npenny of it in a dayÃ¢\\x80\\x99s disaster. But although she wondered, she could\\r\\nnot help loving him the better for his odd combination of Spartan\\r\\nself-control and what appeared to her romantic and childish folly. Ralph\\r\\ninterested her more than any one else in the world, and she often broke\\r\\noff in the middle of one of these economic discussions, in spite of\\r\\ntheir gravity, to consider some fresh aspect of his character.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d be foolish to risk your money on poor old Charles,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she observed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFond as I am of him, he doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t seem to me exactly\\r\\nbrilliant.... Besides, why should you be sacrificed?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear Joan,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph exclaimed, stretching himself out with a gesture\\r\\nof impatience, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you see that weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve all got to be sacrificed?\\r\\nWhatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the use of denying it? WhatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the use of struggling against it?\\r\\nSo it always has been, so it always will be. WeÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got no money and we\\r\\nnever shall have any money. We shall just turn round in the mill every\\r\\nday of our lives until we drop and die, worn out, as most people do,\\r\\nwhen one comes to think of it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoan looked at him, opened her lips as if to speak, and closed them\\r\\nagain. Then she said, very tentatively:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cArenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you happy, Ralph?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. Are you? Perhaps IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m as happy as most people, though. God knows\\r\\nwhether IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m happy or not. What is happiness?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced with half a smile, in spite of his gloomy irritation, at his\\r\\nsister. She looked, as usual, as if she were weighing one thing with\\r\\nanother, and balancing them together before she made up her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHappiness,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she remarked at length enigmatically, rather as if she were\\r\\nsampling the word, and then she paused. She paused for a considerable\\r\\nspace, as if she were considering happiness in all its bearings. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHilda\\r\\nwas here to-day,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she suddenly resumed, as if they had never mentioned\\r\\nhappiness. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe brought Bobbie--heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a fine boy now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph observed,\\r\\nwith an amusement that had a tinge of irony in it, that she was now\\r\\ngoing to sidle away quickly from this dangerous approach to intimacy on\\r\\nto topics of general and family interest. Nevertheless, he reflected,\\r\\nshe was the only one of his family with whom he found it possible to\\r\\ndiscuss happiness, although he might very well have discussed happiness\\r\\nwith Miss Hilbery at their first meeting. He looked critically at Joan,\\r\\nand wished that she did not look so provincial or suburban in her high\\r\\ngreen dress with the faded trimming, so patient, and almost resigned. He\\r\\nbegan to wish to tell her about the Hilberys in order to abuse them,\\r\\nfor in the miniature battle which so often rages between two quickly\\r\\nfollowing impressions of life, the life of the Hilberys was getting the\\r\\nbetter of the life of the Denhams in his mind, and he wanted to assure\\r\\nhimself that there was some quality in which Joan infinitely surpassed\\r\\nMiss Hilbery. He should have felt that his own sister was more original,\\r\\nand had greater vitality than Miss Hilbery had; but his main impression\\r\\nof Katharine now was of a person of great vitality and composure; and at\\r\\nthe moment he could not perceive what poor dear Joan had gained from\\r\\nthe fact that she was the granddaughter of a man who kept a shop, and\\r\\nherself earned her own living. The infinite dreariness and sordidness of\\r\\ntheir life oppressed him in spite of his fundamental belief that, as a\\r\\nfamily, they were somehow remarkable.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShall you talk to mother?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joan inquired. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBecause, you see, the\\r\\nthingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s got to be settled, one way or another. Charles must write to\\r\\nUncle John if heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s going there.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph sighed impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose it doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t much matter either way,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndoomed to misery in the long run.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA slight flush came into JoanÃ¢\\x80\\x99s cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re talking nonsense,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t hurt any one\\r\\nto have to earn their own living. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m very glad I have to earn mine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph was pleased that she should feel this, and wished her to continue,\\r\\nbut he went on, perversely enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIsnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t that only because youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve forgotten how to enjoy yourself? You\\r\\nnever have time for anything decent--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs for instance?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, going for walks, or music, or books, or seeing interesting\\r\\npeople. You never do anything thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s really worth doing any more than I\\r\\ndo.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI always think you could make this room much nicer, if you liked,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nobserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat does it matter what sort of room I have when IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m forced to spend\\r\\nall the best years of my life drawing up deeds in an office?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou said two days ago that you found the law so interesting.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo it is if one could afford to know anything about it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n(Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Herbert only just going to bed now,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Joan interposed, as a\\r\\ndoor on the landing slammed vigorously. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd then he wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t get up in the\\r\\nmorning.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d)\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph looked at the ceiling, and shut his lips closely together. Why,\\r\\nhe wondered, could Joan never for one moment detach her mind from the\\r\\ndetails of domestic life? It seemed to him that she was getting more and\\r\\nmore enmeshed in them, and capable of shorter and less frequent flights\\r\\ninto the outer world, and yet she was only thirty-three.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDÃ¢\\x80\\x99you ever pay calls now?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t often have the time. Why do you ask?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt might be a good thing, to get to know new people, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPoor Ralph!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joan suddenly, with a smile. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou think your sisterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngetting very old and very dull--thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s it, isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think anything of the kind,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said stoutly, but he flushed.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut you lead a dogÃ¢\\x80\\x99s life, Joan. When youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not working in an office,\\r\\nyouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re worrying over the rest of us. And IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not much good to you, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nafraid.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoan rose, and stood for a moment warming her hands, and, apparently,\\r\\nmeditating as to whether she should say anything more or not. A feeling\\r\\nof great intimacy united the brother and sister, and the semicircular\\r\\nlines above their eyebrows disappeared. No, there was nothing more to\\r\\nbe said on either side. Joan brushed her brotherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s head with her hand as\\r\\nshe passed him, murmured good night, and left the room. For some minutes\\r\\nafter she had gone Ralph lay quiescent, resting his head on his hand,\\r\\nbut gradually his eyes filled with thought, and the line reappeared\\r\\non his brow, as the pleasant impression of companionship and ancient\\r\\nsympathy waned, and he was left to think on alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time he opened his book, and read on steadily, glancing once or\\r\\ntwice at his watch, as if he had set himself a task to be accomplished\\r\\nin a certain measure of time. Now and then he heard voices in the house,\\r\\nand the closing of bedroom doors, which showed that the building, at\\r\\nthe top of which he sat, was inhabited in every one of its cells. When\\r\\nmidnight struck, Ralph shut his book, and with a candle in his hand,\\r\\ndescended to the ground floor, to ascertain that all lights were extinct\\r\\nand all doors locked. It was a threadbare, well-worn house that he thus\\r\\nexamined, as if the inmates had grazed down all luxuriance and plenty to\\r\\nthe verge of decency; and in the night, bereft of life, bare places\\r\\nand ancient blemishes were unpleasantly visible. Katharine Hilbery, he\\r\\nthought, would condemn it off-hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\nDenham had accused Katharine Hilbery of belonging to one of the most\\r\\ndistinguished families in England, and if any one will take the trouble\\r\\nto consult Mr. GaltonÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHereditary Genius,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he will find that this\\r\\nassertion is not far from the truth. The Alardyces, the Hilberys, the\\r\\nMillingtons, and the Otways seem to prove that intellect is a possession\\r\\nwhich can be tossed from one member of a certain group to another almost\\r\\nindefinitely, and with apparent certainty that the brilliant gift will\\r\\nbe safely caught and held by nine out of ten of the privileged race.\\r\\nThey had been conspicuous judges and admirals, lawyers and servants of\\r\\nthe State for some years before the richness of the soil culminated\\r\\nin the rarest flower that any family can boast, a great writer, a poet\\r\\neminent among the poets of England, a Richard Alardyce; and having\\r\\nproduced him, they proved once more the amazing virtues of their race\\r\\nby proceeding unconcernedly again with their usual task of breeding\\r\\ndistinguished men. They had sailed with Sir John Franklin to the North\\r\\nPole, and ridden with Havelock to the Relief of Lucknow, and when they\\r\\nwere not lighthouses firmly based on rock for the guidance of their\\r\\ngeneration, they were steady, serviceable candles, illuminating the\\r\\nordinary chambers of daily life. Whatever profession you looked\\r\\nat, there was a Warburton or an Alardyce, a Millington or a Hilbery\\r\\nsomewhere in authority and prominence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be said, indeed, that English society being what it is, no very\\r\\ngreat merit is required, once you bear a well-known name, to put you\\r\\ninto a position where it is easier on the whole to be eminent than\\r\\nobscure. And if this is true of the sons, even the daughters,\\r\\neven in the nineteenth century, are apt to become people of\\r\\nimportance--philanthropists and educationalists if they are spinsters,\\r\\nand the wives of distinguished men if they marry. It is true that there\\r\\nwere several lamentable exceptions to this rule in the Alardyce group,\\r\\nwhich seems to indicate that the cadets of such houses go more rapidly\\r\\nto the bad than the children of ordinary fathers and mothers, as if it\\r\\nwere somehow a relief to them. But, on the whole, in these first years\\r\\nof the twentieth century, the Alardyces and their relations were keeping\\r\\ntheir heads well above water. One finds them at the tops of professions,\\r\\nwith letters after their names; they sit in luxurious public offices,\\r\\nwith private secretaries attached to them; they write solid books in\\r\\ndark covers, issued by the presses of the two great universities, and\\r\\nwhen one of them dies the chances are that another of them writes his\\r\\nbiography.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the source of this nobility was, of course, the poet, and his\\r\\nimmediate descendants, therefore, were invested with greater luster than\\r\\nthe collateral branches. Mrs. Hilbery, in virtue of her position as\\r\\nthe only child of the poet, was spiritually the head of the family, and\\r\\nKatharine, her daughter, had some superior rank among all the cousins\\r\\nand connections, the more so because she was an only child. The\\r\\nAlardyces had married and intermarried, and their offspring were\\r\\ngenerally profuse, and had a way of meeting regularly in each\\r\\notherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s houses for meals and family celebrations which had acquired\\r\\na semi-sacred character, and were as regularly observed as days of\\r\\nfeasting and fasting in the Church.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn times gone by, Mrs. Hilbery had known all the poets, all the\\r\\nnovelists, all the beautiful women and distinguished men of her time.\\r\\nThese being now either dead or secluded in their infirm glory, she\\r\\nmade her house a meeting-place for her own relations, to whom she would\\r\\nlament the passing of the great days of the nineteenth century, when\\r\\nevery department of letters and art was represented in England by two or\\r\\nthree illustrious names. Where are their successors? she would ask, and\\r\\nthe absence of any poet or painter or novelist of the true caliber at\\r\\nthe present day was a text upon which she liked to ruminate, in a sunset\\r\\nmood of benignant reminiscence, which it would have been hard to disturb\\r\\nhad there been need. But she was far from visiting their inferiority\\r\\nupon the younger generation. She welcomed them very heartily to her\\r\\nhouse, told them her stories, gave them sovereigns and ices and good\\r\\nadvice, and weaved round them romances which had generally no likeness\\r\\nto the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe quality of her birth oozed into KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s consciousness from a\\r\\ndozen different sources as soon as she was able to perceive anything.\\r\\nAbove her nursery fireplace hung a photograph of her grandfatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s tomb\\r\\nin PoetsÃ¢\\x80\\x99 Corner, and she was told in one of those moments of grown-up\\r\\nconfidence which are so tremendously impressive to the childÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mind,\\r\\nthat he was buried there because he was a Ã¢\\x80\\x9cgood and great man.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Later,\\r\\non an anniversary, she was taken by her mother through the fog in a\\r\\nhansom cab, and given a large bunch of bright, sweet-scented flowers\\r\\nto lay upon his tomb. The candles in the church, the singing and the\\r\\nbooming of the organ, were all, she thought, in his honor. Again and\\r\\nagain she was brought down into the drawing-room to receive the blessing\\r\\nof some awful distinguished old man, who sat, even to her childish eye,\\r\\nsomewhat apart, all gathered together and clutching a stick, unlike an\\r\\nordinary visitor in her fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s own arm-chair, and her father himself\\r\\nwas there, unlike himself, too, a little excited and very polite. These\\r\\nformidable old creatures used to take her in their arms, look very\\r\\nkeenly in her eyes, and then to bless her, and tell her that she must\\r\\nmind and be a good girl, or detect a look in her face something like\\r\\nRichardÃ¢\\x80\\x99s as a small boy. That drew down upon her her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s fervent\\r\\nembrace, and she was sent back to the nursery very proud, and with a\\r\\nmysterious sense of an important and unexplained state of things, which\\r\\ntime, by degrees, unveiled to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were always visitors--uncles and aunts and cousins Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfrom India,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n to be reverenced for their relationship alone, and others of the\\r\\nsolitary and formidable class, whom she was enjoined by her parents to\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cremember all your life.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d By these means, and from hearing constant\\r\\ntalk of great men and their works, her earliest conceptions of the\\r\\nworld included an august circle of beings to whom she gave the names of\\r\\nShakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Shelley, and so on, who were, for some\\r\\nreason, much more nearly akin to the Hilberys than to other people. They\\r\\nmade a kind of boundary to her vision of life, and played a considerable\\r\\npart in determining her scale of good and bad in her own small affairs.\\r\\nHer descent from one of these gods was no surprise to her, but matter\\r\\nfor satisfaction, until, as the years wore on, the privileges of her\\r\\nlot were taken for granted, and certain drawbacks made themselves very\\r\\nmanifest. Perhaps it is a little depressing to inherit not lands but an\\r\\nexample of intellectual and spiritual virtue; perhaps the conclusiveness\\r\\nof a great ancestor is a little discouraging to those who run the risk\\r\\nof comparison with him. It seems as if, having flowered so splendidly,\\r\\nnothing now remained possible but a steady growth of good, green stalk\\r\\nand leaf. For these reasons, and for others, Katharine had her moments\\r\\nof despondency. The glorious past, in which men and women grew to\\r\\nunexampled size, intruded too much upon the present, and dwarfed it too\\r\\nconsistently, to be altogether encouraging to one forced to make her\\r\\nexperiment in living when the great age was dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was drawn to dwell upon these matters more than was natural, in the\\r\\nfirst place owing to her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s absorption in them, and in the second\\r\\nbecause a great part of her time was spent in imagination with the dead,\\r\\nsince she was helping her mother to produce a life of the great poet.\\r\\nWhen Katharine was seventeen or eighteen--that is to say, some ten years\\r\\nago--her mother had enthusiastically announced that now, with a daughter\\r\\nto help her, the biography would soon be published. Notices to this\\r\\neffect found their way into the literary papers, and for some time\\r\\nKatharine worked with a sense of great pride and achievement.\\r\\n\\r\\nLately, however, it had seemed to her that they were making no way at\\r\\nall, and this was the more tantalizing because no one with the ghost of\\r\\na literary temperament could doubt but that they had materials for one\\r\\nof the greatest biographies that has ever been written. Shelves and\\r\\nboxes bulged with the precious stuff. The most private lives of the\\r\\nmost interesting people lay furled in yellow bundles of close-written\\r\\nmanuscript. In addition to this Mrs. Hilbery had in her own head as\\r\\nbright a vision of that time as now remained to the living, and could\\r\\ngive those flashes and thrills to the old words which gave them almost\\r\\nthe substance of flesh. She had no difficulty in writing, and covered a\\r\\npage every morning as instinctively as a thrush sings, but nevertheless,\\r\\nwith all this to urge and inspire, and the most devout intention\\r\\nto accomplish the work, the book still remained unwritten. Papers\\r\\naccumulated without much furthering their task, and in dull moments\\r\\nKatharine had her doubts whether they would ever produce anything at all\\r\\nfit to lay before the public. Where did the difficulty lie? Not in their\\r\\nmaterials, alas! nor in their ambitions, but in something more profound,\\r\\nin her own inaptitude, and above all, in her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s temperament.\\r\\nKatharine would calculate that she had never known her write for more\\r\\nthan ten minutes at a time. Ideas came to her chiefly when she was in\\r\\nmotion. She liked to perambulate the room with a duster in her hand,\\r\\nwith which she stopped to polish the backs of already lustrous books,\\r\\nmusing and romancing as she did so. Suddenly the right phrase or the\\r\\npenetrating point of view would suggest itself, and she would drop her\\r\\nduster and write ecstatically for a few breathless moments; and then the\\r\\nmood would pass away, and the duster would be sought for, and the old\\r\\nbooks polished again. These spells of inspiration never burnt steadily,\\r\\nbut flickered over the gigantic mass of the subject as capriciously as\\r\\na will-oÃ¢\\x80\\x99-the-wisp, lighting now on this point, now on that. It was as\\r\\nmuch as Katharine could do to keep the pages of her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s manuscript\\r\\nin order, but to sort them so that the sixteenth year of Richard\\r\\nAlardyceÃ¢\\x80\\x99s life succeeded the fifteenth was beyond her skill. And\\r\\nyet they were so brilliant, these paragraphs, so nobly phrased, so\\r\\nlightning-like in their illumination, that the dead seemed to crowd the\\r\\nvery room. Read continuously, they produced a sort of vertigo, and set\\r\\nher asking herself in despair what on earth she was to do with them? Her\\r\\nmother refused, also, to face the radical questions of what to leave in\\r\\nand what to leave out. She could not decide how far the public was to\\r\\nbe told the truth about the poetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s separation from his wife. She drafted\\r\\npassages to suit either case, and then liked each so well that she could\\r\\nnot decide upon the rejection of either.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the book must be written. It was a duty that they owed the world,\\r\\nand to Katharine, at least, it meant more than that, for if they could\\r\\nnot between them get this one book accomplished they had no right to\\r\\ntheir privileged position. Their increment became yearly more and\\r\\nmore unearned. Besides, it must be established indisputably that her\\r\\ngrandfather was a very great man.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time she was twenty-seven, these thoughts had become very\\r\\nfamiliar to her. They trod their way through her mind as she sat\\r\\nopposite her mother of a morning at a table heaped with bundles of\\r\\nold letters and well supplied with pencils, scissors, bottles of gum,\\r\\nindia-rubber bands, large envelopes, and other appliances for the\\r\\nmanufacture of books. Shortly before Ralph DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s visit, Katharine had\\r\\nresolved to try the effect of strict rules upon her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s habits\\r\\nof literary composition. They were to be seated at their tables every\\r\\nmorning at ten oÃ¢\\x80\\x99clock, with a clean-swept morning of empty, secluded\\r\\nhours before them. They were to keep their eyes fast upon the paper, and\\r\\nnothing was to tempt them to speech, save at the stroke of the hour when\\r\\nten minutes for relaxation were to be allowed them. If these rules\\r\\nwere observed for a year, she made out on a sheet of paper that the\\r\\ncompletion of the book was certain, and she laid her scheme before her\\r\\nmother with a feeling that much of the task was already accomplished.\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery examined the sheet of paper very carefully. Then she\\r\\nclapped her hands and exclaimed enthusiastically:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell done, Katharine! What a wonderful head for business youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got!\\r\\nNow I shall keep this before me, and every day I shall make a little\\r\\nmark in my pocketbook, and on the last day of all--let me think, what\\r\\nshall we do to celebrate the last day of all? If it werenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t the winter\\r\\nwe could take a jaunt to Italy. They say SwitzerlandÃ¢\\x80\\x99s very lovely in\\r\\nthe snow, except for the cold. But, as you say, the great thing is to\\r\\nfinish the book. Now let me see--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they inspected her manuscripts, which Katharine had put in order,\\r\\nthey found a state of things well calculated to dash their spirits, if\\r\\nthey had not just resolved on reform. They found, to begin with, a great\\r\\nvariety of very imposing paragraphs with which the biography was\\r\\nto open; many of these, it is true, were unfinished, and resembled\\r\\ntriumphal arches standing upon one leg, but, as Mrs. Hilbery observed,\\r\\nthey could be patched up in ten minutes, if she gave her mind to it.\\r\\nNext, there was an account of the ancient home of the Alardyces, or\\r\\nrather, of spring in Suffolk, which was very beautifully written,\\r\\nalthough not essential to the story. However, Katharine had put together\\r\\na string of names and dates, so that the poet was capably brought into\\r\\nthe world, and his ninth year was reached without further mishap. After\\r\\nthat, Mrs. Hilbery wished, for sentimental reasons, to introduce the\\r\\nrecollections of a very fluent old lady, who had been brought up in the\\r\\nsame village, but these Katharine decided must go. It might be advisable\\r\\nto introduce here a sketch of contemporary poetry contributed by Mr.\\r\\nHilbery, and thus terse and learned and altogether out of keeping with\\r\\nthe rest, but Mrs. Hilbery was of opinion that it was too bare, and made\\r\\none feel altogether like a good little girl in a lecture-room, which was\\r\\nnot at all in keeping with her father. It was put on one side. Now came\\r\\nthe period of his early manhood, when various affairs of the heart must\\r\\neither be concealed or revealed; here again Mrs. Hilbery was of\\r\\ntwo minds, and a thick packet of manuscript was shelved for further\\r\\nconsideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral years were now altogether omitted, because Mrs. Hilbery had\\r\\nfound something distasteful to her in that period, and had preferred to\\r\\ndwell upon her own recollections as a child. After this, it seemed\\r\\nto Katharine that the book became a wild dance of will-oÃ¢\\x80\\x99-the-wisps,\\r\\nwithout form or continuity, without coherence even, or any attempt to\\r\\nmake a narrative. Here were twenty pages upon her grandfatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s taste in\\r\\nhats, an essay upon contemporary china, a long account of a summer dayÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nexpedition into the country, when they had missed their train, together\\r\\nwith fragmentary visions of all sorts of famous men and women, which\\r\\nseemed to be partly imaginary and partly authentic. There were,\\r\\nmoreover, thousands of letters, and a mass of faithful recollections\\r\\ncontributed by old friends, which had grown yellow now in their\\r\\nenvelopes, but must be placed somewhere, or their feelings would be\\r\\nhurt. So many volumes had been written about the poet since his death\\r\\nthat she had also to dispose of a great number of misstatements, which\\r\\ninvolved minute researches and much correspondence. Sometimes Katharine\\r\\nbrooded, half crushed, among her papers; sometimes she felt that it was\\r\\nnecessary for her very existence that she should free herself from the\\r\\npast; at others, that the past had completely displaced the present,\\r\\nwhich, when one resumed life after a morning among the dead, proved to\\r\\nbe of an utterly thin and inferior composition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst of it was that she had no aptitude for literature. She did\\r\\nnot like phrases. She had even some natural antipathy to that process of\\r\\nself-examination, that perpetual effort to understand oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s own feeling,\\r\\nand express it beautifully, fitly, or energetically in language, which\\r\\nconstituted so great a part of her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s existence. She was, on the\\r\\ncontrary, inclined to be silent; she shrank from expressing herself even\\r\\nin talk, let alone in writing. As this disposition was highly convenient\\r\\nin a family much given to the manufacture of phrases, and seemed to\\r\\nargue a corresponding capacity for action, she was, from her childhood\\r\\neven, put in charge of household affairs. She had the reputation, which\\r\\nnothing in her manner contradicted, of being the most practical of\\r\\npeople. Ordering meals, directing servants, paying bills, and so\\r\\ncontriving that every clock ticked more or less accurately in time, and\\r\\na number of vases were always full of fresh flowers was supposed to be a\\r\\nnatural endowment of hers, and, indeed, Mrs. Hilbery often observed that\\r\\nit was poetry the wrong side out. From a very early age, too, she had\\r\\nto exert herself in another capacity; she had to counsel and help and\\r\\ngenerally sustain her mother. Mrs. Hilbery would have been perfectly\\r\\nwell able to sustain herself if the world had been what the world is\\r\\nnot. She was beautifully adapted for life in another planet. But the\\r\\nnatural genius she had for conducting affairs there was of no real use\\r\\nto her here. Her watch, for example, was a constant source of surprise\\r\\nto her, and at the age of sixty-five she was still amazed at the\\r\\nascendancy which rules and reasons exerted over the lives of other\\r\\npeople. She had never learnt her lesson, and had constantly to be\\r\\npunished for her ignorance. But as that ignorance was combined with a\\r\\nfine natural insight which saw deep whenever it saw at all, it was not\\r\\npossible to write Mrs. Hilbery off among the dunces; on the contrary,\\r\\nshe had a way of seeming the wisest person in the room. But, on the\\r\\nwhole, she found it very necessary to seek support in her daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine, thus, was a member of a very great profession which has, as\\r\\nyet, no title and very little recognition, although the labor of mill\\r\\nand factory is, perhaps, no more severe and the results of less benefit\\r\\nto the world. She lived at home. She did it very well, too. Any one\\r\\ncoming to the house in Cheyne Walk felt that here was an orderly place,\\r\\nshapely, controlled--a place where life had been trained to show to\\r\\nthe best advantage, and, though composed of different elements, made to\\r\\nappear harmonious and with a character of its own. Perhaps it was\\r\\nthe chief triumph of KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s art that Mrs. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s character\\r\\npredominated. She and Mr. Hilbery appeared to be a rich background for\\r\\nher motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s more striking qualities.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilence being, thus, both natural to her and imposed upon her, the only\\r\\nother remark that her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s friends were in the habit of making about\\r\\nit was that it was neither a stupid silence nor an indifferent silence.\\r\\nBut to what quality it owed its character, since character of some sort\\r\\nit had, no one troubled themselves to inquire. It was understood that\\r\\nshe was helping her mother to produce a great book. She was known to\\r\\nmanage the household. She was certainly beautiful. That accounted for\\r\\nher satisfactorily. But it would have been a surprise, not only to other\\r\\npeople but to Katharine herself, if some magic watch could have taken\\r\\ncount of the moments spent in an entirely different occupation from her\\r\\nostensible one. Sitting with faded papers before her, she took part in\\r\\na series of scenes such as the taming of wild ponies upon the American\\r\\nprairies, or the conduct of a vast ship in a hurricane round a black\\r\\npromontory of rock, or in others more peaceful, but marked by her\\r\\ncomplete emancipation from her present surroundings and, needless to\\r\\nsay, by her surpassing ability in her new vocation. When she was rid of\\r\\nthe pretense of paper and pen, phrase-making and biography, she turned\\r\\nher attention in a more legitimate direction, though, strangely enough,\\r\\nshe would rather have confessed her wildest dreams of hurricane and\\r\\nprairie than the fact that, upstairs, alone in her room, she rose early\\r\\nin the morning or sat up late at night to... work at mathematics. No\\r\\nforce on earth would have made her confess that. Her actions when thus\\r\\nengaged were furtive and secretive, like those of some nocturnal animal.\\r\\nSteps had only to sound on the staircase, and she slipped her paper\\r\\nbetween the leaves of a great Greek dictionary which she had purloined\\r\\nfrom her fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s room for this purpose. It was only at night, indeed,\\r\\nthat she felt secure enough from surprise to concentrate her mind to the\\r\\nutmost.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the unwomanly nature of the science made her instinctively wish\\r\\nto conceal her love of it. But the more profound reason was that in her\\r\\nmind mathematics were directly opposed to literature. She would not\\r\\nhave cared to confess how infinitely she preferred the exactitude, the\\r\\nstar-like impersonality, of figures to the confusion, agitation, and\\r\\nvagueness of the finest prose. There was something a little unseemly in\\r\\nthus opposing the tradition of her family; something that made her feel\\r\\nwrong-headed, and thus more than ever disposed to shut her desires away\\r\\nfrom view and cherish them with extraordinary fondness. Again and again\\r\\nshe was thinking of some problem when she should have been thinking\\r\\nof her grandfather. Waking from these trances, she would see that her\\r\\nmother, too, had lapsed into some dream almost as visionary as her own,\\r\\nfor the people who played their parts in it had long been numbered\\r\\namong the dead. But, seeing her own state mirrored in her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s face,\\r\\nKatharine would shake herself awake with a sense of irritation. Her\\r\\nmother was the last person she wished to resemble, much though she\\r\\nadmired her. Her common sense would assert itself almost brutally, and\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery, looking at her with her odd sidelong glance, that was half\\r\\nmalicious and half tender, would liken her to Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyour wicked old Uncle\\r\\nJudge Peter, who used to be heard delivering sentence of death in the\\r\\nbathroom. Thank Heaven, Katharine, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve not a drop of HIM in me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nAt about nine oÃ¢\\x80\\x99clock at night, on every alternate Wednesday, Miss Mary\\r\\nDatchet made the same resolve, that she would never again lend her\\r\\nrooms for any purposes whatsoever. Being, as they were, rather large and\\r\\nconveniently situated in a street mostly dedicated to offices off the\\r\\nStrand, people who wished to meet, either for purposes of enjoyment,\\r\\nor to discuss art, or to reform the State, had a way of suggesting that\\r\\nMary had better be asked to lend them her rooms. She always met the\\r\\nrequest with the same frown of well-simulated annoyance, which presently\\r\\ndissolved in a kind of half-humorous, half-surly shrug, as of a large\\r\\ndog tormented by children who shakes his ears. She would lend her room,\\r\\nbut only on condition that all the arrangements were made by her. This\\r\\nfortnightly meeting of a society for the free discussion of everything\\r\\nentailed a great deal of moving, and pulling, and ranging of furniture\\r\\nagainst the wall, and placing of breakable and precious things in safe\\r\\nplaces. Miss Datchet was quite capable of lifting a kitchen table on\\r\\nher back, if need were, for although well-proportioned and\\r\\ndressed becomingly, she had the appearance of unusual strength and\\r\\ndetermination.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was some twenty-five years of age, but looked older because she\\r\\nearned, or intended to earn, her own living, and had already lost the\\r\\nlook of the irresponsible spectator, and taken on that of the private in\\r\\nthe army of workers. Her gestures seemed to have a certain purpose, the\\r\\nmuscles round eyes and lips were set rather firmly, as though the senses\\r\\nhad undergone some discipline, and were held ready for a call on them.\\r\\nShe had contracted two faint lines between her eyebrows, not from\\r\\nanxiety but from thought, and it was quite evident that all the feminine\\r\\ninstincts of pleasing, soothing, and charming were crossed by others in\\r\\nno way peculiar to her sex. For the rest she was brown-eyed, a little\\r\\nclumsy in movement, and suggested country birth and a descent from\\r\\nrespectable hard-working ancestors, who had been men of faith and\\r\\nintegrity rather than doubters or fanatics.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of a fairly hard dayÃ¢\\x80\\x99s work it was certainly something of an\\r\\neffort to clear oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s room, to pull the mattress off oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s bed, and lay\\r\\nit on the floor, to fill a pitcher with cold coffee, and to sweep a long\\r\\ntable clear for plates and cups and saucers, with pyramids of little\\r\\npink biscuits between them; but when these alterations were effected,\\r\\nMary felt a lightness of spirit come to her, as if she had put off the\\r\\nstout stuff of her working hours and slipped over her entire being some\\r\\nvesture of thin, bright silk. She knelt before the fire and looked out\\r\\ninto the room. The light fell softly, but with clear radiance, through\\r\\nshades of yellow and blue paper, and the room, which was set with one\\r\\nor two sofas resembling grassy mounds in their lack of shape, looked\\r\\nunusually large and quiet. Mary was led to think of the heights of\\r\\na Sussex down, and the swelling green circle of some camp of ancient\\r\\nwarriors. The moonlight would be falling there so peacefully now, and\\r\\nshe could fancy the rough pathway of silver upon the wrinkled skin of\\r\\nthe sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd here we are,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, half aloud, half satirically, yet with\\r\\nevident pride, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ctalking about art.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe pulled a basket containing balls of differently colored wools and a\\r\\npair of stockings which needed darning towards her, and began to set her\\r\\nfingers to work; while her mind, reflecting the lassitude of her body,\\r\\nwent on perversely, conjuring up visions of solitude and quiet, and she\\r\\npictured herself laying aside her knitting and walking out on to the\\r\\ndown, and hearing nothing but the sheep cropping the grass close to the\\r\\nroots, while the shadows of the little trees moved very slightly this\\r\\nway and that in the moonlight, as the breeze went through them. But\\r\\nshe was perfectly conscious of her present situation, and derived some\\r\\npleasure from the reflection that she could rejoice equally in solitude,\\r\\nand in the presence of the many very different people who were now\\r\\nmaking their way, by divers paths, across London to the spot where she\\r\\nwas sitting.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she ran her needle in and out of the wool, she thought of the\\r\\nvarious stages in her own life which made her present position seem the\\r\\nculmination of successive miracles. She thought of her clerical father\\r\\nin his country parsonage, and of her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s death, and of her own\\r\\ndetermination to obtain education, and of her college life, which had\\r\\nmerged, not so very long ago, in the wonderful maze of London, which\\r\\nstill seemed to her, in spite of her constitutional level-headedness,\\r\\nlike a vast electric light, casting radiance upon the myriads of men and\\r\\nwomen who crowded round it. And here she was at the very center of it\\r\\nall, that center which was constantly in the minds of people in remote\\r\\nCanadian forests and on the plains of India, when their thoughts turned\\r\\nto England. The nine mellow strokes, by which she was now apprised of\\r\\nthe hour, were a message from the great clock at Westminster itself. As\\r\\nthe last of them died away, there was a firm knocking on her own door,\\r\\nand she rose and opened it. She returned to the room, with a look of\\r\\nsteady pleasure in her eyes, and she was talking to Ralph Denham, who\\r\\nfollowed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAlone?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, as if he were pleasantly surprised by that fact.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am sometimes alone,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut you expect a great many people,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, looking round him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nlike a room on the stage. Who is it to-night?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWilliam Rodney, upon the Elizabethan use of metaphor. I expect a good\\r\\nsolid paper, with plenty of quotations from the classics.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph warmed his hands at the fire, which was flapping bravely in the\\r\\ngrate, while Mary took up her stocking again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose you are the only woman in London who darns her own\\r\\nstockings,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m only one of a great many thousands really,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthough I\\r\\nmust admit that I was thinking myself very remarkable when you came in.\\r\\nAnd now that youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re here I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think myself remarkable at all. How\\r\\nhorrid of you! But IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re much more remarkable than I am.\\r\\nYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve done much more than IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve done.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s your standard, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve nothing to be proud of,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph\\r\\ngrimly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, I must reflect with Emerson that itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s being and not doing that\\r\\nmatters,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEmerson?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph exclaimed, with derision. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mean to say you\\r\\nread Emerson?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps it wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t Emerson; but why shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t I read Emerson?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nasked, with a tinge of anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no reason that I know of. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the combination thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nodd--books and stockings. The combination is very odd.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d But it seemed\\r\\nto recommend itself to him. Mary gave a little laugh, expressive of\\r\\nhappiness, and the particular stitches that she was now putting into her\\r\\nwork appeared to her to be done with singular grace and felicity. She\\r\\nheld out the stocking and looked at it approvingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou always say that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI assure you itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a common\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x98combination,Ã¢\\x80\\x99 as you call it, in the houses of the clergy. The only\\r\\nthing thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s odd about me is that I enjoy them both--Emerson and the\\r\\nstocking.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA knock was heard, and Ralph exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDamn those people! I wish they werenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t coming!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s only Mr. Turner, on the floor below,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, and she felt\\r\\ngrateful to Mr. Turner for having alarmed Ralph, and for having given a\\r\\nfalse alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWill there be a crowd?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph asked, after a pause.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be the Morrises and the Crashaws, and Dick Osborne, and\\r\\nSeptimus, and all that set. Katharine Hilbery is coming, by the way, so\\r\\nWilliam Rodney told me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine Hilbery!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know her?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary asked, with some surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI went to a tea-party at her house.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary pressed him to tell her all about it, and Ralph was not at all\\r\\nunwilling to exhibit proofs of the extent of his knowledge. He described\\r\\nthe scene with certain additions and exaggerations which interested Mary\\r\\nvery much.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut, in spite of what you say, I do admire her,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve only\\r\\nseen her once or twice, but she seems to me to be what one calls a\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x98personality.Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mean to abuse her. I only felt that she wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t very\\r\\nsympathetic to me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey say sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s going to marry that queer creature Rodney.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMarry Rodney? Then she must be more deluded than I thought her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s my door, all right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary exclaimed, carefully putting\\r\\nher wools away, as a succession of knocks reverberated unnecessarily,\\r\\naccompanied by a sound of people stamping their feet and laughing. A\\r\\nmoment later the room was full of young men and women, who came in with\\r\\na peculiar look of expectation, exclaimed Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d when they saw Denham,\\r\\nand then stood still, gaping rather foolishly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room very soon contained between twenty and thirty people, who found\\r\\nseats for the most part upon the floor, occupying the mattresses, and\\r\\nhunching themselves together into triangular shapes. They were all young\\r\\nand some of them seemed to make a protest by their hair and dress, and\\r\\nsomething somber and truculent in the expression of their faces, against\\r\\nthe more normal type, who would have passed unnoticed in an omnibus or\\r\\nan underground railway. It was notable that the talk was confined to\\r\\ngroups, and was, at first, entirely spasmodic in character, and muttered\\r\\nin undertones as if the speakers were suspicious of their fellow-guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine Hilbery came in rather late, and took up a position on\\r\\nthe floor, with her back against the wall. She looked round quickly,\\r\\nrecognized about half a dozen people, to whom she nodded, but failed to\\r\\nsee Ralph, or, if so, had already forgotten to attach any name to him.\\r\\nBut in a second these heterogeneous elements were all united by the\\r\\nvoice of Mr. Rodney, who suddenly strode up to the table, and began very\\r\\nrapidly in high-strained tones:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn undertaking to speak of the Elizabethan use of metaphor in poetry--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the different heads swung slightly or steadied themselves into a\\r\\nposition in which they could gaze straight at the speakerÃ¢\\x80\\x99s face, and\\r\\nthe same rather solemn expression was visible on all of them. But,\\r\\nat the same time, even the faces that were most exposed to view, and\\r\\ntherefore most tautly under control, disclosed a sudden impulsive tremor\\r\\nwhich, unless directly checked, would have developed into an outburst of\\r\\nlaughter. The first sight of Mr. Rodney was irresistibly ludicrous.\\r\\nHe was very red in the face, whether from the cool November night or\\r\\nnervousness, and every movement, from the way he wrung his hands to the\\r\\nway he jerked his head to right and left, as though a vision drew him\\r\\nnow to the door, now to the window, bespoke his horrible discomfort\\r\\nunder the stare of so many eyes. He was scrupulously well dressed, and\\r\\na pearl in the center of his tie seemed to give him a touch of\\r\\naristocratic opulence. But the rather prominent eyes and the impulsive\\r\\nstammering manner, which seemed to indicate a torrent of ideas\\r\\nintermittently pressing for utterance and always checked in their course\\r\\nby a clutch of nervousness, drew no pity, as in the case of a more\\r\\nimposing personage, but a desire to laugh, which was, however, entirely\\r\\nlacking in malice. Mr. Rodney was evidently so painfully conscious of\\r\\nthe oddity of his appearance, and his very redness and the starts to\\r\\nwhich his body was liable gave such proof of his own discomfort,\\r\\nthat there was something endearing in this ridiculous susceptibility,\\r\\nalthough most people would probably have echoed DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s private\\r\\nexclamation, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFancy marrying a creature like that!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis paper was carefully written out, but in spite of this precaution\\r\\nMr. Rodney managed to turn over two sheets instead of one, to choose the\\r\\nwrong sentence where two were written together, and to discover his own\\r\\nhandwriting suddenly illegible. When he found himself possessed of a\\r\\ncoherent passage, he shook it at his audience almost aggressively, and\\r\\nthen fumbled for another. After a distressing search a fresh discovery\\r\\nwould be made, and produced in the same way, until, by means of repeated\\r\\nattacks, he had stirred his audience to a degree of animation quite\\r\\nremarkable in these gatherings. Whether they were stirred by his\\r\\nenthusiasm for poetry or by the contortions which a human being was\\r\\ngoing through for their benefit, it would be hard to say. At length Mr.\\r\\nRodney sat down impulsively in the middle of a sentence, and, after a\\r\\npause of bewilderment, the audience expressed its relief at being able\\r\\nto laugh aloud in a decided outburst of applause.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Rodney acknowledged this with a wild glance round him, and, instead\\r\\nof waiting to answer questions, he jumped up, thrust himself through\\r\\nthe seated bodies into the corner where Katharine was sitting, and\\r\\nexclaimed, very audibly:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Katharine, I hope IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve made a big enough fool of myself even for\\r\\nyou! It was terrible! terrible! terrible!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHush! You must answer their questions,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine whispered, desiring,\\r\\nat all costs, to keep him quiet. Oddly enough, when the speaker was no\\r\\nlonger in front of them, there seemed to be much that was suggestive in\\r\\nwhat he had said. At any rate, a pale-faced young man with sad eyes was\\r\\nalready on his feet, delivering an accurately worded speech with perfect\\r\\ncomposure. William Rodney listened with a curious lifting of his upper\\r\\nlip, although his face was still quivering slightly with emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIdiot!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he whispered. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s misunderstood every word I said!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell then, answer him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine whispered back.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, I shanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t! TheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99d only laugh at me. Why did I let you persuade me\\r\\nthat these sort of people care for literature?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was much to be said both for and against Mr. RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s paper. It\\r\\nhad been crammed with assertions that such-and-such passages, taken\\r\\nliberally from English, French, and Italian, are the supreme pearls of\\r\\nliterature. Further, he was fond of using metaphors which, compounded\\r\\nin the study, were apt to sound either cramped or out of place as he\\r\\ndelivered them in fragments. Literature was a fresh garland of spring\\r\\nflowers, he said, in which yew-berries and the purple nightshade mingled\\r\\nwith the various tints of the anemone; and somehow or other this garland\\r\\nencircled marble brows. He had read very badly some very beautiful\\r\\nquotations. But through his manner and his confusion of language there\\r\\nhad emerged some passion of feeling which, as he spoke, formed in the\\r\\nmajority of the audience a little picture or an idea which each now was\\r\\neager to give expression to. Most of the people there proposed to spend\\r\\ntheir lives in the practice either of writing or painting, and merely\\r\\nby looking at them it could be seen that, as they listened to Mr. Purvis\\r\\nfirst, and then to Mr. Greenhalgh, they were seeing something done by\\r\\nthese gentlemen to a possession which they thought to be their own. One\\r\\nperson after another rose, and, as with an ill-balanced axe, attempted\\r\\nto hew out his conception of art a little more clearly, and sat down\\r\\nwith the feeling that, for some reason which he could not grasp, his\\r\\nstrokes had gone awry. As they sat down they turned almost invariably to\\r\\nthe person sitting next them, and rectified and continued what they\\r\\nhad just said in public. Before long, therefore, the groups on the\\r\\nmattresses and the groups on the chairs were all in communication with\\r\\neach other, and Mary Datchet, who had begun to darn stockings again,\\r\\nstooped down and remarked to Ralph:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat was what I call a first-rate paper.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of them instinctively turned their eyes in the direction of the\\r\\nreader of the paper. He was lying back against the wall, with his\\r\\neyes apparently shut, and his chin sunk upon his collar. Katharine was\\r\\nturning over the pages of his manuscript as if she were looking for\\r\\nsome passage that had particularly struck her, and had a difficulty in\\r\\nfinding it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s go and tell him how much we liked it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, thus suggesting\\r\\nan action which Ralph was anxious to take, though without her he would\\r\\nhave been too proud to do it, for he suspected that he had more interest\\r\\nin Katharine than she had in him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat was a very interesting paper,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary began, without any shyness,\\r\\nseating herself on the floor opposite to Rodney and Katharine. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWill you\\r\\nlend me the manuscript to read in peace?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRodney, who had opened his eyes on their approach, regarded her for a\\r\\nmoment in suspicious silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you say that merely to disguise the fact of my ridiculous failure?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine looked up from her reading with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe says he doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mind what we think of him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she remarked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe says\\r\\nwe donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t care a rap for art of any kind.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI asked her to pity me, and she teases me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t intend to pity you, Mr. Rodney,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary remarked, kindly, but\\r\\nfirmly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhen a paperÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a failure, nobody says anything, whereas now,\\r\\njust listen to them!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sound, which filled the room, with its hurry of short syllables, its\\r\\nsudden pauses, and its sudden attacks, might be compared to some animal\\r\\nhubbub, frantic and inarticulate.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDÃ¢\\x80\\x99you think thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all about my paper?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney inquired, after a\\r\\nmomentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s attention, with a distinct brightening of expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf course it is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt was a very suggestive paper.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned to Denham for confirmation, and he corroborated her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the ten minutes after a paper is read that proves whether itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbeen a success or not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf I were you, Rodney, I should be\\r\\nvery pleased with myself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis commendation seemed to comfort Mr. Rodney completely, and he began\\r\\nto bethink him of all the passages in his paper which deserved to be\\r\\ncalled Ã¢\\x80\\x9csuggestive.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid you agree at all, Denham, with what I said about ShakespeareÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nlater use of imagery? IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid I didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t altogether make my meaning\\r\\nplain.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere he gathered himself together, and by means of a series of frog-like\\r\\njerks, succeeded in bringing himself close to Denham.\\r\\n\\r\\nDenham answered him with the brevity which is the result of having\\r\\nanother sentence in the mind to be addressed to another person. He\\r\\nwished to say to Katharine: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDid you remember to get that picture glazed\\r\\nbefore your aunt came to dinner?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but, besides having to answer Rodney,\\r\\nhe was not sure that the remark, with its assertion of intimacy, would\\r\\nnot strike Katharine as impertinent. She was listening to what some one\\r\\nin another group was saying. Rodney, meanwhile, was talking about the\\r\\nElizabethan dramatists.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a curious-looking man since, upon first sight, especially if\\r\\nhe chanced to be talking with animation, he appeared, in some way,\\r\\nridiculous; but, next moment, in repose, his face, with its large nose,\\r\\nthin cheeks and lips expressing the utmost sensibility, somehow recalled\\r\\na Roman head bound with laurel, cut upon a circle of semi-transparent\\r\\nreddish stone. It had dignity and character. By profession a clerk in\\r\\na Government office, he was one of those martyred spirits to whom\\r\\nliterature is at once a source of divine joy and of almost intolerable\\r\\nirritation. Not content to rest in their love of it, they must attempt\\r\\nto practise it themselves, and they are generally endowed with very\\r\\nlittle facility in composition. They condemn whatever they produce.\\r\\nMoreover, the violence of their feelings is such that they seldom meet\\r\\nwith adequate sympathy, and being rendered very sensitive by their\\r\\ncultivated perceptions, suffer constant slights both to their own\\r\\npersons and to the thing they worship. But Rodney could never resist\\r\\nmaking trial of the sympathies of any one who seemed favorably disposed,\\r\\nand DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s praise had stimulated his very susceptible vanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou remember the passage just before the death of the Duchess?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ncontinued, edging still closer to Denham, and adjusting his elbow and\\r\\nknee in an incredibly angular combination. Here, Katharine, who had been\\r\\ncut off by these maneuvers from all communication with the outer world,\\r\\nrose, and seated herself upon the window-sill, where she was joined by\\r\\nMary Datchet. The two young women could thus survey the whole party.\\r\\nDenham looked after them, and made as if he were tearing handfuls of\\r\\ngrass up by the roots from the carpet. But as it fell in accurately\\r\\nwith his conception of life that all oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s desires were bound to be\\r\\nfrustrated, he concentrated his mind upon literature, and determined,\\r\\nphilosophically, to get what he could out of that.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine was pleasantly excited. A variety of courses was open to her.\\r\\nShe knew several people slightly, and at any moment one of them might\\r\\nrise from the floor and come and speak to her; on the other hand, she\\r\\nmight select somebody for herself, or she might strike into RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndiscourse, to which she was intermittently attentive. She was conscious\\r\\nof MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s body beside her, but, at the same time, the consciousness of\\r\\nbeing both of them women made it unnecessary to speak to her. But Mary,\\r\\nfeeling, as she had said, that Katharine was a Ã¢\\x80\\x9cpersonality,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d wished so\\r\\nmuch to speak to her that in a few moments she did.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re exactly like a flock of sheep, arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t they?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said,\\r\\nreferring to the noise that rose from the scattered bodies beneath her.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine turned and smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wonder what theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re making such a noise about?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe Elizabethans, I suppose.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s got anything to do with the Elizabethans. There!\\r\\nDidnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you hear them say, Ã¢\\x80\\x98Insurance BillÃ¢\\x80\\x99?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wonder why men always talk about politics?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary speculated. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nsuppose, if we had votes, we should, too.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI dare say we should. And you spend your life in getting us votes,\\r\\ndonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, stoutly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFrom ten to six every day IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m at it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine looked at Ralph Denham, who was now pounding his way through\\r\\nthe metaphysics of metaphor with Rodney, and was reminded of his talk\\r\\nthat Sunday afternoon. She connected him vaguely with Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re one of the people who think we should all have\\r\\nprofessions,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, rather distantly, as if feeling her way among\\r\\nthe phantoms of an unknown world.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh dear no,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, I think I do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine continued, with half a sigh. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou will\\r\\nalways be able to say that youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve done something, whereas, in a crowd\\r\\nlike this, I feel rather melancholy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn a crowd? Why in a crowd?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary asked, deepening the two lines\\r\\nbetween her eyes, and hoisting herself nearer to Katharine upon the\\r\\nwindow-sill.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you see how many different things these people care about? And\\r\\nI want to beat them down--I only mean,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she corrected herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat I\\r\\nwant to assert myself, and itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s difficult, if one hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t a profession.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary smiled, thinking that to beat people down was a process that should\\r\\npresent no difficulty to Miss Katharine Hilbery. They knew each other\\r\\nso slightly that the beginning of intimacy, which Katharine seemed to\\r\\ninitiate by talking about herself, had something solemn in it, and they\\r\\nwere silent, as if to decide whether to proceed or not. They tested the\\r\\nground.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, but I want to trample upon their prostrate bodies!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine\\r\\nannounced, a moment later, with a laugh, as if at the train of thought\\r\\nwhich had led her to this conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOne doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t necessarily trample upon peopleÃ¢\\x80\\x99s bodies because one runs\\r\\nan office,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. Perhaps not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied. The conversation lapsed, and Mary\\r\\nsaw Katharine looking out into the room rather moodily with closed lips,\\r\\nthe desire to talk about herself or to initiate a friendship having,\\r\\napparently, left her. Mary was struck by her capacity for being thus\\r\\neasily silent, and occupied with her own thoughts. It was a habit that\\r\\nspoke of loneliness and a mind thinking for itself. When Katharine\\r\\nremained silent Mary was slightly embarrassed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re very like sheep,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she repeated, foolishly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd yet they are very clever--at least,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine added, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose\\r\\nthey have all read Webster.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSurely you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think that a proof of cleverness? IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve read Webster,\\r\\nIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve read Ben Jonson, but I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think myself clever--not exactly, at\\r\\nleast.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think you must be very clever,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy? Because I run an office?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t thinking of that. I was thinking how you live alone in this\\r\\nroom, and have parties.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary reflected for a second.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt means, chiefly, a power of being disagreeable to oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s own family,\\r\\nI think. I have that, perhaps. I didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to live at home, and I\\r\\ntold my father. He didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like it.... But then I have a sister, and you\\r\\nhavenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t, have you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, I havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t any sisters.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are writing a life of your grandfather?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary pursued.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine seemed instantly to be confronted by some familiar thought\\r\\nfrom which she wished to escape. She replied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I am helping my\\r\\nmother,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d in such a way that Mary felt herself baffled, and put back\\r\\nagain into the position in which she had been at the beginning of their\\r\\ntalk. It seemed to her that Katharine possessed a curious power of\\r\\ndrawing near and receding, which sent alternate emotions through her\\r\\nfar more quickly than was usual, and kept her in a condition of\\r\\ncurious alertness. Desiring to classify her, Mary bethought her of the\\r\\nconvenient term Ã¢\\x80\\x9cegoist.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s an egoist,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, and stored that word up to\\r\\ngive to Ralph one day when, as it would certainly fall out, they were\\r\\ndiscussing Miss Hilbery.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHeavens, what a mess thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be to-morrow morning!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine\\r\\nexclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI hope you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t sleep in this room, Miss Datchet?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat are you laughing at?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t tell you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLet me guess. You were laughing because you thought IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d changed the\\r\\nconversation?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause you think--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She paused.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you want to know, I was laughing at the way you said Miss Datchet.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMary, then. Mary, Mary, Mary.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, Katharine drew back the curtain in order, perhaps, to conceal\\r\\nthe momentary flush of pleasure which is caused by coming perceptibly\\r\\nnearer to another person.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMary Datchet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not such an imposing name as Katharine\\r\\nHilbery, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey both looked out of the window, first up at the hard silver moon,\\r\\nstationary among a hurry of little grey-blue clouds, and then down upon\\r\\nthe roofs of London, with all their upright chimneys, and then below\\r\\nthem at the empty moonlit pavement of the street, upon which the joint\\r\\nof each paving-stone was clearly marked out. Mary then saw Katharine\\r\\nraise her eyes again to the moon, with a contemplative look in them, as\\r\\nthough she were setting that moon against the moon of other nights,\\r\\nheld in memory. Some one in the room behind them made a joke about\\r\\nstar-gazing, which destroyed their pleasure in it, and they looked back\\r\\ninto the room again.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph had been watching for this moment, and he instantly produced his\\r\\nsentence.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wonder, Miss Hilbery, whether you remembered to get that picture\\r\\nglazed?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d His voice showed that the question was one that had been\\r\\nprepared.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, you idiot!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary exclaimed, very nearly aloud, with a sense that\\r\\nRalph had said something very stupid. So, after three lessons in Latin\\r\\ngrammar, one might correct a fellow student, whose knowledge did not\\r\\nembrace the ablative of Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmensa.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPicture--what picture?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine asked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, at home, you mean--that\\r\\nSunday afternoon. Was it the day Mr. Fortescue came? Yes, I think I\\r\\nremembered it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three of them stood for a moment awkwardly silent, and then Mary\\r\\nleft them in order to see that the great pitcher of coffee was properly\\r\\nhandled, for beneath all her education she preserved the anxieties of\\r\\none who owns china.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph could think of nothing further to say; but could one have stripped\\r\\noff his mask of flesh, one would have seen that his will-power was\\r\\nrigidly set upon a single object--that Miss Hilbery should obey him.\\r\\nHe wished her to stay there until, by some measures not yet apparent\\r\\nto him, he had conquered her interest. These states of mind transmit\\r\\nthemselves very often without the use of language, and it was evident to\\r\\nKatharine that this young man had fixed his mind upon her. She instantly\\r\\nrecalled her first impressions of him, and saw herself again proffering\\r\\nfamily relics. She reverted to the state of mind in which he had\\r\\nleft her that Sunday afternoon. She supposed that he judged her very\\r\\nseverely. She argued naturally that, if this were the case, the burden\\r\\nof the conversation should rest with him. But she submitted so far as\\r\\nto stand perfectly still, her eyes upon the opposite wall, and her lips\\r\\nvery nearly closed, though the desire to laugh stirred them slightly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know the names of the stars, I suppose?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham remarked, and from\\r\\nthe tone of his voice one might have thought that he grudged Katharine\\r\\nthe knowledge he attributed to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe kept her voice steady with some difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI know how to find the Pole star if IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m lost.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t suppose that often happens to you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. Nothing interesting ever happens to me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think you make a system of saying disagreeable things, Miss Hilbery,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n he broke out, again going further than he meant to. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s one\\r\\nof the characteristics of your class. They never talk seriously to their\\r\\ninferiors.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether it was that they were meeting on neutral ground to-night, or\\r\\nwhether the carelessness of an old grey coat that Denham wore gave an\\r\\nease to his bearing that he lacked in conventional dress, Katharine\\r\\ncertainly felt no impulse to consider him outside the particular set in\\r\\nwhich she lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn what sense are you my inferior?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked, looking at him gravely,\\r\\nas though honestly searching for his meaning. The look gave him great\\r\\npleasure. For the first time he felt himself on perfectly equal terms\\r\\nwith a woman whom he wished to think well of him, although he could\\r\\nnot have explained why her opinion of him mattered one way or another.\\r\\nPerhaps, after all, he only wanted to have something of her to take home\\r\\nto think about. But he was not destined to profit by his advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think I understand what you mean,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine repeated, and then\\r\\nshe was obliged to stop and answer some one who wished to know whether\\r\\nshe would buy a ticket for an opera from them, at a reduction. Indeed,\\r\\nthe temper of the meeting was now unfavorable to separate conversation;\\r\\nit had become rather debauched and hilarious, and people who scarcely\\r\\nknew each other were making use of Christian names with apparent\\r\\ncordiality, and had reached that kind of gay tolerance and general\\r\\nfriendliness which human beings in England only attain after sitting\\r\\ntogether for three hours or so, and the first cold blast in the air\\r\\nof the street freezes them into isolation once more. Cloaks were being\\r\\nflung round the shoulders, hats swiftly pinned to the head; and Denham\\r\\nhad the mortification of seeing Katharine helped to prepare herself by\\r\\nthe ridiculous Rodney. It was not the convention of the meeting to say\\r\\ngood-bye, or necessarily even to nod to the person with whom one was\\r\\ntalking; but, nevertheless, Denham was disappointed by the completeness\\r\\nwith which Katharine parted from him, without any attempt to finish her\\r\\nsentence. She left with Rodney.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\nDenham had no conscious intention of following Katharine, but, seeing\\r\\nher depart, he took his hat and ran rather more quickly down the stairs\\r\\nthan he would have done if Katharine had not been in front of him. He\\r\\novertook a friend of his, by name Harry Sandys, who was going the same\\r\\nway, and they walked together a few paces behind Katharine and Rodney.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night was very still, and on such nights, when the traffic thins\\r\\naway, the walker becomes conscious of the moon in the street, as if the\\r\\ncurtains of the sky had been drawn apart, and the heaven lay bare, as\\r\\nit does in the country. The air was softly cool, so that people who\\r\\nhad been sitting talking in a crowd found it pleasant to walk a little\\r\\nbefore deciding to stop an omnibus or encounter light again in an\\r\\nunderground railway. Sandys, who was a barrister with a philosophic\\r\\ntendency, took out his pipe, lit it, murmured Ã¢\\x80\\x9chumÃ¢\\x80\\x9d and Ã¢\\x80\\x9cha,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and was\\r\\nsilent. The couple in front of them kept their distance accurately, and\\r\\nappeared, so far as Denham could judge by the way they turned towards\\r\\neach other, to be talking very constantly. He observed that when a\\r\\npedestrian going the opposite way forced them to part they came together\\r\\nagain directly afterwards. Without intending to watch them he never\\r\\nquite lost sight of the yellow scarf twisted round KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s head, or\\r\\nthe light overcoat which made Rodney look fashionable among the crowd.\\r\\nAt the Strand he supposed that they would separate, but instead they\\r\\ncrossed the road, and took their way down one of the narrow passages\\r\\nwhich lead through ancient courts to the river. Among the crowd of\\r\\npeople in the big thoroughfares Rodney seemed merely to be lending\\r\\nKatharine his escort, but now, when passengers were rare and the\\r\\nfootsteps of the couple were distinctly heard in the silence, Denham\\r\\ncould not help picturing to himself some change in their conversation.\\r\\nThe effect of the light and shadow, which seemed to increase their\\r\\nheight, was to make them mysterious and significant, so that Denham\\r\\nhad no feeling of irritation with Katharine, but rather a half-dreamy\\r\\nacquiescence in the course of the world. Yes, she did very well to dream\\r\\nabout--but Sandys had suddenly begun to talk. He was a solitary man who\\r\\nhad made his friends at college and always addressed them as if they\\r\\nwere still undergraduates arguing in his room, though many months or\\r\\neven years had passed in some cases between the last sentence and the\\r\\npresent one. The method was a little singular, but very restful, for\\r\\nit seemed to ignore completely all accidents of human life, and to span\\r\\nvery deep abysses with a few simple words.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this occasion he began, while they waited for a minute on the edge of\\r\\nthe Strand:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI hear that Bennett has given up his theory of truth.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDenham returned a suitable answer, and he proceeded to explain how\\r\\nthis decision had been arrived at, and what changes it involved in the\\r\\nphilosophy which they both accepted. Meanwhile Katharine and Rodney drew\\r\\nfurther ahead, and Denham kept, if that is the right expression for an\\r\\ninvoluntary action, one filament of his mind upon them, while with the\\r\\nrest of his intelligence he sought to understand what Sandys was saying.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they passed through the courts thus talking, Sandys laid the tip of\\r\\nhis stick upon one of the stones forming a time-worn arch, and struck\\r\\nit meditatively two or three times in order to illustrate something very\\r\\nobscure about the complex nature of oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s apprehension of facts. During\\r\\nthe pause which this necessitated, Katharine and Rodney turned the\\r\\ncorner and disappeared. For a moment Denham stopped involuntarily in his\\r\\nsentence, and continued it with a sense of having lost something.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnconscious that they were observed, Katharine and Rodney had come out\\r\\non the Embankment. When they had crossed the road, Rodney slapped his\\r\\nhand upon the stone parapet above the river and exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI promise I wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t say another word about it, Katharine! But do stop a\\r\\nminute and look at the moon upon the water.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine paused, looked up and down the river, and snuffed the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure one can smell the sea, with the wind blowing this way,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stood silent for a few moments while the river shifted in its bed,\\r\\nand the silver and red lights which were laid upon it were torn by the\\r\\ncurrent and joined together again. Very far off up the river a steamer\\r\\nhooted with its hollow voice of unspeakable melancholy, as if from the\\r\\nheart of lonely mist-shrouded voyagings.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney cried, striking his hand once more upon the balustrade,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cwhy canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t one say how beautiful it all is? Why am I condemned for\\r\\never, Katharine, to feel what I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t express? And the things I can give\\r\\nthereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no use in my giving. Trust me, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added hastily,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t speak of it again. But in the presence of beauty--look at\\r\\nthe iridescence round the moon!--one feels--one feels--Perhaps if you\\r\\nmarried me--IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m half a poet, you see, and I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t pretend not to feel\\r\\nwhat I do feel. If I could write--ah, that would be another matter. I\\r\\nshouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t bother you to marry me then, Katharine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe spoke these disconnected sentences rather abruptly, with his eyes\\r\\nalternately upon the moon and upon the stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut for me I suppose you would recommend marriage?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine,\\r\\nwith her eyes fixed on the moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCertainly I should. Not for you only, but for all women. Why, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re\\r\\nnothing at all without it; youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re only half alive; using only half\\r\\nyour faculties; you must feel that for yourself. That is why--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Here he\\r\\nstopped himself, and they began to walk slowly along the Embankment, the\\r\\nmoon fronting them.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWith how sad steps she climbs the sky,\\r\\n    How silently and with how wan a face,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRodney quoted.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been told a great many unpleasant things about myself to-night,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Katharine stated, without attending to him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Denham seems to think\\r\\nit his mission to lecture me, though I hardly know him. By the way,\\r\\nWilliam, you know him; tell me, what is he like?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam drew a deep sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe may lecture you till weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re blue in the face--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes--but whatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s he like?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd we write sonnets to your eyebrows, you cruel practical creature.\\r\\nDenham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, as Katharine remained silent. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA good fellow, I\\r\\nshould think. He cares, naturally, for the right sort of things, I\\r\\nexpect. But you mustnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t marry him, though. He scolded you, did he--what\\r\\ndid he say?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat happens with Mr. Denham is this: He comes to tea. I do all I can\\r\\nto put him at his ease. He merely sits and scowls at me. Then I show him\\r\\nour manuscripts. At this he becomes really angry, and tells me IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve no\\r\\nbusiness to call myself a middle-class woman. So we part in a huff; and\\r\\nnext time we meet, which was to-night, he walks straight up to me, and\\r\\nsays, Ã¢\\x80\\x98Go to the Devil!Ã¢\\x80\\x99 ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the sort of behavior my mother complains\\r\\nof. I want to know, what does it mean?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused and, slackening her steps, looked at the lighted train\\r\\ndrawing itself smoothly over Hungerford Bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt means, I should say, that he finds you chilly and unsympathetic.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine laughed with round, separate notes of genuine amusement.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s time I jumped into a cab and hid myself in my own house,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nexclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWould your mother object to my being seen with you? No one could\\r\\npossibly recognize us, could they?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney inquired, with some\\r\\nsolicitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine looked at him, and perceiving that his solicitude was genuine,\\r\\nshe laughed again, but with an ironical note in her laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou may laugh, Katharine, but I can tell you that if any of your\\r\\nfriends saw us together at this time of night they would talk about it,\\r\\nand I should find that very disagreeable. But why do you laugh?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know. Because youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re such a queer mixture, I think. YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re half\\r\\npoet and half old maid.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI know I always seem to you highly ridiculous. But I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t help having\\r\\ninherited certain traditions and trying to put them into practice.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNonsense, William. You may come of the oldest family in Devonshire,\\r\\nbut thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no reason why you should mind being seen alone with me on the\\r\\nEmbankment.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m ten years older than you are, Katharine, and I know more of the\\r\\nworld than you do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery well. Leave me and go home.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRodney looked back over his shoulder and perceived that they were being\\r\\nfollowed at a short distance by a taxicab, which evidently awaited his\\r\\nsummons. Katharine saw it, too, and exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t call that cab for me, William. I shall walk.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNonsense, Katharine; youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll do nothing of the kind. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s nearly twelve\\r\\noÃ¢\\x80\\x99clock, and weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve walked too far as it is.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine laughed and walked on so quickly that both Rodney and the\\r\\ntaxicab had to increase their pace to keep up with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, William,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif people see me racing along the Embankment\\r\\nlike this they WILL talk. You had far better say good-night, if you\\r\\ndonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want people to talk.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this William beckoned, with a despotic gesture, to the cab with one\\r\\nhand, and with the other he brought Katharine to a standstill.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t let the man see us struggling, for GodÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sake!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he murmured.\\r\\nKatharine stood for a moment quite still.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s more of the old maid in you than the poet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she observed\\r\\nbriefly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam shut the door sharply, gave the address to the driver, and\\r\\nturned away, lifting his hat punctiliously high in farewell to the\\r\\ninvisible lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked back after the cab twice, suspiciously, half expecting that\\r\\nshe would stop it and dismount; but it bore her swiftly on, and was\\r\\nsoon out of sight. William felt in the mood for a short soliloquy of\\r\\nindignation, for Katharine had contrived to exasperate him in more ways\\r\\nthan one.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf all the unreasonable, inconsiderate creatures IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve ever known, sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nthe worst!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed to himself, striding back along the Embankment.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHeaven forbid that I should ever make a fool of myself with her\\r\\nagain. Why, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d sooner marry the daughter of my landlady than Katharine\\r\\nHilbery! SheÃ¢\\x80\\x99d leave me not a momentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s peace--and sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99d never understand\\r\\nme--never, never, never!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUttered aloud and with vehemence so that the stars of Heaven might\\r\\nhear, for there was no human being at hand, these sentiments sounded\\r\\nsatisfactorily irrefutable. Rodney quieted down, and walked on in\\r\\nsilence, until he perceived some one approaching him, who had something,\\r\\neither in his walk or his dress, which proclaimed that he was one of\\r\\nWilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s acquaintances before it was possible to tell which of them he\\r\\nwas. It was Denham who, having parted from Sandys at the bottom of his\\r\\nstaircase, was now walking to the Tube at Charing Cross, deep in the\\r\\nthoughts which his talk with Sandys had suggested. He had forgotten the\\r\\nmeeting at Mary DatchetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s rooms, he had forgotten Rodney, and metaphors\\r\\nand Elizabethan drama, and could have sworn that he had forgotten\\r\\nKatharine Hilbery, too, although that was more disputable. His mind\\r\\nwas scaling the highest pinnacles of its alps, where there was only\\r\\nstarlight and the untrodden snow. He cast strange eyes upon Rodney, as\\r\\nthey encountered each other beneath a lamp-post.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHa!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he had been in full possession of his mind, Denham would probably\\r\\nhave passed on with a salutation. But the shock of the interruption made\\r\\nhim stand still, and before he knew what he was doing, he had turned and\\r\\nwas walking with Rodney in obedience to RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s invitation to come to\\r\\nhis rooms and have something to drink. Denham had no wish to drink with\\r\\nRodney, but he followed him passively enough. Rodney was gratified by\\r\\nthis obedience. He felt inclined to be communicative with this silent\\r\\nman, who possessed so obviously all the good masculine qualities in\\r\\nwhich Katharine now seemed lamentably deficient.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou do well, Denham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he began impulsively, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto have nothing to do\\r\\nwith young women. I offer you my experience--if one trusts them one\\r\\ninvariably has cause to repent. Not that I have any reason at this\\r\\nmoment,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added hastily, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto complain of them. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a subject that\\r\\ncrops up now and again for no particular reason. Miss Datchet, I dare\\r\\nsay, is one of the exceptions. Do you like Miss Datchet?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThese remarks indicated clearly enough that RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s nerves were in a\\r\\nstate of irritation, and Denham speedily woke to the situation of the\\r\\nworld as it had been one hour ago. He had last seen Rodney walking with\\r\\nKatharine. He could not help regretting the eagerness with which his\\r\\nmind returned to these interests, and fretted him with the old trivial\\r\\nanxieties. He sank in his own esteem. Reason bade him break from Rodney,\\r\\nwho clearly tended to become confidential, before he had utterly lost\\r\\ntouch with the problems of high philosophy. He looked along the road,\\r\\nand marked a lamp-post at a distance of some hundred yards, and decided\\r\\nthat he would part from Rodney when they reached this point.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I like Mary; I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see how one could help liking her,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nremarked cautiously, with his eye on the lamp-post.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, Denham, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re so different from me. You never give yourself away.\\r\\nI watched you this evening with Katharine Hilbery. My instinct is to\\r\\ntrust the person IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m talking to. ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s why IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m always being taken in, I\\r\\nsuppose.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDenham seemed to be pondering this statement of RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s, but, as a\\r\\nmatter of fact, he was hardly conscious of Rodney and his revelations,\\r\\nand was only concerned to make him mention Katharine again before they\\r\\nreached the lamp-post.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhoÃ¢\\x80\\x99s taken you in now?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine Hilbery?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRodney stopped and once more began beating a kind of rhythm, as if he\\r\\nwere marking a phrase in a symphony, upon the smooth stone balustrade of\\r\\nthe Embankment.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine Hilbery,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated, with a curious little chuckle. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo,\\r\\nDenham, I have no illusions about that young woman. I think I made that\\r\\nplain to her to-night. But donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t run away with a false impression,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n he continued eagerly, turning and linking his arm through DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s, as\\r\\nthough to prevent him from escaping; and, thus compelled, Denham passed\\r\\nthe monitory lamp-post, to which, in passing, he breathed an excuse, for\\r\\nhow could he break away when RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s arm was actually linked in his?\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou must not think that I have any bitterness against her--far from it.\\r\\nItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not altogether her fault, poor girl. She lives, you know, one of\\r\\nthose odious, self-centered lives--at least, I think them odious for a\\r\\nwoman--feeding her wits upon everything, having control of everything,\\r\\ngetting far too much her own way at home--spoilt, in a sense, feeling\\r\\nthat every one is at her feet, and so not realizing how she hurts--that\\r\\nis, how rudely she behaves to people who havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t all her advantages.\\r\\nStill, to do her justice, sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no fool,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, as if to warn\\r\\nDenham not to take any liberties. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe has taste. She has sense. She can\\r\\nunderstand you when you talk to her. But sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a woman, and thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s an\\r\\nend of it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, with another little chuckle, and dropped DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\narm.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd did you tell her all this to-night?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh dear me, no. I should never think of telling Katharine the truth\\r\\nabout herself. That wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t do at all. One has to be in an attitude of\\r\\nadoration in order to get on with Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve learnt that sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s refused to marry him why donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t I go home?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Denham thought to himself. But he went on walking beside Rodney, and for\\r\\na time they did not speak, though Rodney hummed snatches of a tune out\\r\\nof an opera by Mozart. A feeling of contempt and liking combine\\r\\nvery naturally in the mind of one to whom another has just spoken\\r\\nunpremeditatedly, revealing rather more of his private feelings than he\\r\\nintended to reveal. Denham began to wonder what sort of person Rodney\\r\\nwas, and at the same time Rodney began to think about Denham.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re a slave like me, I suppose?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA solicitor, yes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI sometimes wonder why we donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t chuck it. Why donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you emigrate,\\r\\nDenham? I should have thought that would suit you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve a family.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m often on the point of going myself. And then I know I couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t live\\r\\nwithout thisÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--and he waved his hand towards the City of London, which\\r\\nwore, at this moment, the appearance of a town cut out of gray-blue\\r\\ncardboard, and pasted flat against the sky, which was of a deeper blue.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere are one or two people IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m fond of, and thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a little good\\r\\nmusic, and a few pictures, now and then--just enough to keep one\\r\\ndangling about here. Ah, but I couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t live with savages! Are you fond\\r\\nof books? Music? Pictures? DÃ¢\\x80\\x99you care at all for first editions? IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\ngot a few nice things up here, things I pick up cheap, for I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nafford to give what they ask.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had reached a small court of high eighteenth-century houses, in\\r\\none of which Rodney had his rooms. They climbed a very steep staircase,\\r\\nthrough whose uncurtained windows the moonlight fell, illuminating the\\r\\nbanisters with their twisted pillars, and the piles of plates set on the\\r\\nwindow-sills, and jars half-full of milk. RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s rooms were small, but\\r\\nthe sitting-room window looked out into a courtyard, with its flagged\\r\\npavement, and its single tree, and across to the flat red-brick fronts\\r\\nof the opposite houses, which would not have surprised Dr. Johnson, if\\r\\nhe had come out of his grave for a turn in the moonlight. Rodney lit\\r\\nhis lamp, pulled his curtains, offered Denham a chair, and, flinging\\r\\nthe manuscript of his paper on the Elizabethan use of Metaphor on to the\\r\\ntable, exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh dear me, what a waste of time! But itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s over now, and so we may\\r\\nthink no more about it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then busied himself very dexterously in lighting a fire, producing\\r\\nglasses, whisky, a cake, and cups and saucers. He put on a faded crimson\\r\\ndressing-gown, and a pair of red slippers, and advanced to Denham with a\\r\\ntumbler in one hand and a well-burnished book in the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe Baskerville Congreve,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Rodney, offering it to his guest. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\ncouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t read him in a cheap edition.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he was seen thus among his books and his valuables, amiably anxious\\r\\nto make his visitor comfortable, and moving about with something of\\r\\nthe dexterity and grace of a Persian cat, Denham relaxed his critical\\r\\nattitude, and felt more at home with Rodney than he would have done with\\r\\nmany men better known to him. RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s room was the room of a person\\r\\nwho cherishes a great many personal tastes, guarding them from the rough\\r\\nblasts of the public with scrupulous attention. His papers and his books\\r\\nrose in jagged mounds on table and floor, round which he skirted with\\r\\nnervous care lest his dressing-gown might disarrange them ever so\\r\\nslightly. On a chair stood a stack of photographs of statues and\\r\\npictures, which it was his habit to exhibit, one by one, for the space\\r\\nof a day or two. The books on his shelves were as orderly as\\r\\nregiments of soldiers, and the backs of them shone like so many bronze\\r\\nbeetle-wings; though, if you took one from its place you saw a shabbier\\r\\nvolume behind it, since space was limited. An oval Venetian mirror stood\\r\\nabove the fireplace, and reflected duskily in its spotted depths the\\r\\nfaint yellow and crimson of a jarful of tulips which stood among the\\r\\nletters and pipes and cigarettes upon the mantelpiece. A small piano\\r\\noccupied a corner of the room, with the score of Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDon GiovanniÃ¢\\x80\\x9d open\\r\\nupon the bracket.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Rodney,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Denham, as he filled his pipe and looked about him,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cthis is all very nice and comfortable.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRodney turned his head half round and smiled, with the pride of a\\r\\nproprietor, and then prevented himself from smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTolerable,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he muttered.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut I dare say itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s just as well that you have to earn your own\\r\\nliving.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you mean that I shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t do anything good with leisure if I had\\r\\nit, I dare say youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re right. But I should be ten times as happy with my\\r\\nwhole day to spend as I liked.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI doubt that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sat silent, and the smoke from their pipes joined amicably in a\\r\\nblue vapor above their heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI could spend three hours every day reading Shakespeare,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney\\r\\nremarked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s music and pictures, let alone the society of the\\r\\npeople one likes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99d be bored to death in a yearÃ¢\\x80\\x99s time.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, I grant you I should be bored if I did nothing. But I should write\\r\\nplays.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHÃ¢\\x80\\x99m!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should write plays,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve written three-quarters of one\\r\\nalready, and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m only waiting for a holiday to finish it. And itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not\\r\\nbad--no, some of itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s really rather nice.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question arose in DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mind whether he should ask to see this\\r\\nplay, as, no doubt, he was expected to do. He looked rather stealthily\\r\\nat Rodney, who was tapping the coal nervously with a poker, and\\r\\nquivering almost physically, so Denham thought, with desire to talk\\r\\nabout this play of his, and vanity unrequited and urgent. He seemed very\\r\\nmuch at DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mercy, and Denham could not help liking him, partly on\\r\\nthat account.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,... will you let me see the play?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham asked, and Rodney looked\\r\\nimmediately appeased, but, nevertheless, he sat silent for a moment,\\r\\nholding the poker perfectly upright in the air, regarding it with his\\r\\nrather prominent eyes, and opening his lips and shutting them again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you really care for this kind of thing?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked at length, in a\\r\\ndifferent tone of voice from that in which he had been speaking. And,\\r\\nwithout waiting for an answer, he went on, rather querulously: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cVery few\\r\\npeople care for poetry. I dare say it bores you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll lend it you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney announced, putting down the poker.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he moved to fetch the play, Denham stretched a hand to the bookcase\\r\\nbeside him, and took down the first volume which his fingers touched.\\r\\nIt happened to be a small and very lovely edition of Sir Thomas Browne,\\r\\ncontaining the Ã¢\\x80\\x9cUrn Burial,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHydriotaphia,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and the Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGarden of\\r\\nCyrus,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and, opening it at a passage which he knew very nearly by heart,\\r\\nDenham began to read and, for some time, continued to read.\\r\\n\\r\\nRodney resumed his seat, with his manuscript on his knee, and from\\r\\ntime to time he glanced at Denham, and then joined his finger-tips and\\r\\ncrossed his thin legs over the fender, as if he experienced a good deal\\r\\nof pleasure. At length Denham shut the book, and stood, with his back to\\r\\nthe fireplace, occasionally making an inarticulate humming sound which\\r\\nseemed to refer to Sir Thomas Browne. He put his hat on his head, and\\r\\nstood over Rodney, who still lay stretched back in his chair, with his\\r\\ntoes within the fender.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI shall look in again some time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham remarked, upon which Rodney\\r\\nheld up his hand, containing his manuscript, without saying anything\\r\\nexcept--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf you like.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDenham took the manuscript and went. Two days later he was much\\r\\nsurprised to find a thin parcel on his breakfast-plate, which, on being\\r\\nopened, revealed the very copy of Sir Thomas Browne which he had studied\\r\\nso intently in RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s rooms. From sheer laziness he returned no\\r\\nthanks, but he thought of Rodney from time to time with interest,\\r\\ndisconnecting him from Katharine, and meant to go round one evening and\\r\\nsmoke a pipe with him. It pleased Rodney thus to give away whatever his\\r\\nfriends genuinely admired. His library was constantly being diminished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the hours of an ordinary working week-day, which are the\\r\\npleasantest to look forward to and to look back upon? If a single\\r\\ninstance is of use in framing a theory, it may be said that the minutes\\r\\nbetween nine-twenty-five and nine-thirty in the morning had a singular\\r\\ncharm for Mary Datchet. She spent them in a very enviable frame of mind;\\r\\nher contentment was almost unalloyed. High in the air as her flat was,\\r\\nsome beams from the morning sun reached her even in November, striking\\r\\nstraight at curtain, chair, and carpet, and painting there three bright,\\r\\ntrue spaces of green, blue, and purple, upon which the eye rested with a\\r\\npleasure which gave physical warmth to the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were few mornings when Mary did not look up, as she bent to\\r\\nlace her boots, and as she followed the yellow rod from curtain to\\r\\nbreakfast-table she usually breathed some sigh of thankfulness that her\\r\\nlife provided her with such moments of pure enjoyment. She was robbing\\r\\nno one of anything, and yet, to get so much pleasure from simple things,\\r\\nsuch as eating oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s breakfast alone in a room which had nice colors in\\r\\nit, clean from the skirting of the boards to the corners of the ceiling,\\r\\nseemed to suit her so thoroughly that she used at first to hunt about\\r\\nfor some one to apologize to, or for some flaw in the situation. She had\\r\\nnow been six months in London, and she could find no flaw, but that, as\\r\\nshe invariably concluded by the time her boots were laced, was solely\\r\\nand entirely due to the fact that she had her work. Every day, as she\\r\\nstood with her dispatch-box in her hand at the door of her flat, and\\r\\ngave one look back into the room to see that everything was straight\\r\\nbefore she left, she said to herself that she was very glad that she\\r\\nwas going to leave it all, that to have sat there all day long, in the\\r\\nenjoyment of leisure, would have been intolerable.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut in the street she liked to think herself one of the workers who,\\r\\nat this hour, take their way in rapid single file along all the broad\\r\\npavements of the city, with their heads slightly lowered, as if all\\r\\ntheir effort were to follow each other as closely as might be; so that\\r\\nMary used to figure to herself a straight rabbit-run worn by their\\r\\nunswerving feet upon the pavement. But she liked to pretend that she was\\r\\nindistinguishable from the rest, and that when a wet day drove her to\\r\\nthe Underground or omnibus, she gave and took her share of crowd and\\r\\nwet with clerks and typists and commercial men, and shared with them\\r\\nthe serious business of winding-up the world to tick for another\\r\\nfour-and-twenty hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus thinking, on the particular morning in question, she made her away\\r\\nacross LincolnÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Inn Fields and up Kingsway, and so through Southampton\\r\\nRow until she reached her office in Russell Square. Now and then she\\r\\nwould pause and look into the window of some bookseller or flower shop,\\r\\nwhere, at this early hour, the goods were being arranged, and empty gaps\\r\\nbehind the plate glass revealed a state of undress. Mary felt kindly\\r\\ndisposed towards the shopkeepers, and hoped that they would trick the\\r\\nmidday public into purchasing, for at this hour of the morning she\\r\\nranged herself entirely on the side of the shopkeepers and bank clerks,\\r\\nand regarded all who slept late and had money to spend as her enemy\\r\\nand natural prey. And directly she had crossed the road at Holborn, her\\r\\nthoughts all came naturally and regularly to roost upon her work, and\\r\\nshe forgot that she was, properly speaking, an amateur worker, whose\\r\\nservices were unpaid, and could hardly be said to wind the world up for\\r\\nits daily task, since the world, so far, had shown very little desire to\\r\\ntake the boons which MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s society for womanÃ¢\\x80\\x99s suffrage had offered it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was thinking all the way up Southampton Row of notepaper and\\r\\nfoolscap, and how an economy in the use of paper might be effected\\r\\n(without, of course, hurting Mrs. SealÃ¢\\x80\\x99s feelings), for she was certain\\r\\nthat the great organizers always pounce, to begin with, upon trifles\\r\\nlike these, and build up their triumphant reforms upon a basis of\\r\\nabsolute solidity; and, without acknowledging it for a moment, Mary\\r\\nDatchet was determined to be a great organizer, and had already doomed\\r\\nher society to reconstruction of the most radical kind. Once or twice\\r\\nlately, it is true, she had started, broad awake, before turning into\\r\\nRussell Square, and denounced herself rather sharply for being already\\r\\nin a groove, capable, that is, of thinking the same thoughts every\\r\\nmorning at the same hour, so that the chestnut-colored brick of the\\r\\nRussell Square houses had some curious connection with her thoughts\\r\\nabout office economy, and served also as a sign that she should get\\r\\ninto trim for meeting Mr. Clacton, or Mrs. Seal, or whoever might be\\r\\nbeforehand with her at the office. Having no religious belief, she was\\r\\nthe more conscientious about her life, examining her position from time\\r\\nto time very seriously, and nothing annoyed her more than to find one of\\r\\nthese bad habits nibbling away unheeded at the precious substance. What\\r\\nwas the good, after all, of being a woman if one didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t keep fresh, and\\r\\ncram oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s life with all sorts of views and experiments? Thus she always\\r\\ngave herself a little shake, as she turned the corner, and, as often as\\r\\nnot, reached her own door whistling a snatch of a Somersetshire ballad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe suffrage office was at the top of one of the large Russell Square\\r\\nhouses, which had once been lived in by a great city merchant and his\\r\\nfamily, and was now let out in slices to a number of societies which\\r\\ndisplayed assorted initials upon doors of ground glass, and kept, each\\r\\nof them, a typewriter which clicked busily all day long. The old\\r\\nhouse, with its great stone staircase, echoed hollowly to the sound of\\r\\ntypewriters and of errand-boys from ten to six. The noise of different\\r\\ntypewriters already at work, disseminating their views upon the\\r\\nprotection of native races, or the value of cereals as foodstuffs,\\r\\nquickened MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s steps, and she always ran up the last flight of steps\\r\\nwhich led to her own landing, at whatever hour she came, so as to get\\r\\nher typewriter to take its place in competition with the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat herself down to her letters, and very soon all these\\r\\nspeculations were forgotten, and the two lines drew themselves between\\r\\nher eyebrows, as the contents of the letters, the office furniture, and\\r\\nthe sounds of activity in the next room gradually asserted their sway\\r\\nupon her. By eleven oÃ¢\\x80\\x99clock the atmosphere of concentration was running\\r\\nso strongly in one direction that any thought of a different order could\\r\\nhardly have survived its birth more than a moment or so. The task which\\r\\nlay before her was to organize a series of entertainments, the profits\\r\\nof which were to benefit the society, which drooped for want of funds.\\r\\nIt was her first attempt at organization on a large scale, and she meant\\r\\nto achieve something remarkable. She meant to use the cumbrous machine\\r\\nto pick out this, that, and the other interesting person from the muddle\\r\\nof the world, and to set them for a week in a pattern which must\\r\\ncatch the eyes of Cabinet Ministers, and the eyes once caught, the old\\r\\narguments were to be delivered with unexampled originality. Such was\\r\\nthe scheme as a whole; and in contemplation of it she would become quite\\r\\nflushed and excited, and have to remind herself of all the details that\\r\\nintervened between her and success.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door would open, and Mr. Clacton would come in to search for a\\r\\ncertain leaflet buried beneath a pyramid of leaflets. He was a thin,\\r\\nsandy-haired man of about thirty-five, spoke with a Cockney accent, and\\r\\nhad about him a frugal look, as if nature had not dealt generously with\\r\\nhim in any way, which, naturally, prevented him from dealing generously\\r\\nwith other people. When he had found his leaflet, and offered a few\\r\\njocular hints upon keeping papers in order, the typewriting would stop\\r\\nabruptly, and Mrs. Seal would burst into the room with a letter which\\r\\nneeded explanation in her hand. This was a more serious interruption\\r\\nthan the other, because she never knew exactly what she wanted, and\\r\\nhalf a dozen requests would bolt from her, no one of which was clearly\\r\\nstated. Dressed in plum-colored velveteen, with short, gray hair, and a\\r\\nface that seemed permanently flushed with philanthropic enthusiasm,\\r\\nshe was always in a hurry, and always in some disorder. She wore two\\r\\ncrucifixes, which got themselves entangled in a heavy gold chain upon\\r\\nher breast, and seemed to Mary expressive of her mental ambiguity. Only\\r\\nher vast enthusiasm and her worship of Miss Markham, one of the pioneers\\r\\nof the society, kept her in her place, for which she had no sound\\r\\nqualification.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the morning wore on, and the pile of letters grew, and Mary felt, at\\r\\nlast, that she was the center ganglion of a very fine network of nerves\\r\\nwhich fell over England, and one of these days, when she touched the\\r\\nheart of the system, would begin feeling and rushing together and\\r\\nemitting their splendid blaze of revolutionary fireworks--for some such\\r\\nmetaphor represents what she felt about her work, when her brain had\\r\\nbeen heated by three hours of application.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly before one oÃ¢\\x80\\x99clock Mr. Clacton and Mrs. Seal desisted from their\\r\\nlabors, and the old joke about luncheon, which came out regularly\\r\\nat this hour, was repeated with scarcely any variation of words.\\r\\nMr. Clacton patronized a vegetarian restaurant; Mrs. Seal brought\\r\\nsandwiches, which she ate beneath the plane-trees in Russell Square;\\r\\nwhile Mary generally went to a gaudy establishment, upholstered in red\\r\\nplush, near by, where, much to the vegetarianÃ¢\\x80\\x99s disapproval, you could\\r\\nbuy steak, two inches thick, or a roast section of fowl, swimming in a\\r\\npewter dish.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe bare branches against the sky do one so much GOOD,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Seal\\r\\nasserted, looking out into the Square.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut one canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t lunch off trees, Sally,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI confess I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know how you manage it, Miss Datchet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Clacton\\r\\nremarked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should sleep all the afternoon, I know, if I took a heavy\\r\\nmeal in the middle of the day.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the very latest thing in literature?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary asked, good-humoredly\\r\\npointing to the yellow-covered volume beneath Mr. ClactonÃ¢\\x80\\x99s arm, for he\\r\\ninvariably read some new French author at lunch-time, or squeezed in\\r\\na visit to a picture gallery, balancing his social work with an ardent\\r\\nculture of which he was secretly proud, as Mary had very soon divined.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they parted and Mary walked away, wondering if they guessed that she\\r\\nreally wanted to get away from them, and supposing that they had not\\r\\nquite reached that degree of subtlety. She bought herself an evening\\r\\npaper, which she read as she ate, looking over the top of it again\\r\\nand again at the queer people who were buying cakes or imparting their\\r\\nsecrets, until some young woman whom she knew came in, and she called\\r\\nout, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cEleanor, come and sit by me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and they finished their lunch\\r\\ntogether, parting on the strip of pavement among the different lines of\\r\\ntraffic with a pleasant feeling that they were stepping once more into\\r\\ntheir separate places in the great and eternally moving pattern of human\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, instead of going straight back to the office to-day, Mary turned\\r\\ninto the British Museum, and strolled down the gallery with the shapes\\r\\nof stone until she found an empty seat directly beneath the gaze of the\\r\\nElgin marbles. She looked at them, and seemed, as usual, borne up on\\r\\nsome wave of exaltation and emotion, by which her life at once became\\r\\nsolemn and beautiful--an impression which was due as much, perhaps,\\r\\nto the solitude and chill and silence of the gallery as to the actual\\r\\nbeauty of the statues. One must suppose, at least, that her emotions\\r\\nwere not purely esthetic, because, after she had gazed at the Ulysses\\r\\nfor a minute or two, she began to think about Ralph Denham. So secure\\r\\ndid she feel with these silent shapes that she almost yielded to an\\r\\nimpulse to say Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am in love with youÃ¢\\x80\\x9d aloud. The presence of this\\r\\nimmense and enduring beauty made her almost alarmingly conscious of her\\r\\ndesire, and at the same time proud of a feeling which did not display\\r\\nanything like the same proportions when she was going about her daily\\r\\nwork.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe repressed her impulse to speak aloud, and rose and wandered about\\r\\nrather aimlessly among the statues until she found herself in another\\r\\ngallery devoted to engraved obelisks and winged Assyrian bulls, and her\\r\\nemotion took another turn. She began to picture herself traveling with\\r\\nRalph in a land where these monsters were couchant in the sand. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFor,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she thought to herself, as she gazed fixedly at some information printed\\r\\nbehind a piece of glass, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe wonderful thing about you is that youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re\\r\\nready for anything; youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not in the least conventional, like most\\r\\nclever men.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she conjured up a scene of herself on a camelÃ¢\\x80\\x99s back, in the desert,\\r\\nwhile Ralph commanded a whole tribe of natives.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat is what you can do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went on, moving on to the next statue.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou always make people do what you want.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA glow spread over her spirit, and filled her eyes with brightness.\\r\\nNevertheless, before she left the Museum she was very far from saying,\\r\\neven in the privacy of her own mind, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am in love with you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and that\\r\\nsentence might very well never have framed itself. She was, indeed,\\r\\nrather annoyed with herself for having allowed such an ill-considered\\r\\nbreach of her reserve, weakening her powers of resistance, she felt,\\r\\nshould this impulse return again. For, as she walked along the street to\\r\\nher office, the force of all her customary objections to being in love\\r\\nwith any one overcame her. She did not want to marry at all. It seemed\\r\\nto her that there was something amateurish in bringing love into touch\\r\\nwith a perfectly straightforward friendship, such as hers was with\\r\\nRalph, which, for two years now, had based itself upon common interests\\r\\nin impersonal topics, such as the housing of the poor, or the taxation\\r\\nof land values.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the afternoon spirit differed intrinsically from the morning spirit.\\r\\nMary found herself watching the flight of a bird, or making drawings of\\r\\nthe branches of the plane-trees upon her blotting-paper. People came in\\r\\nto see Mr. Clacton on business, and a seductive smell of cigarette smoke\\r\\nissued from his room. Mrs. Seal wandered about with newspaper cuttings,\\r\\nwhich seemed to her either Ã¢\\x80\\x9cquite splendidÃ¢\\x80\\x9d or Ã¢\\x80\\x9creally too bad for\\r\\nwords.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She used to paste these into books, or send them to her friends,\\r\\nhaving first drawn a broad bar in blue pencil down the margin, a\\r\\nproceeding which signified equally and indistinguishably the depths of\\r\\nher reprobation or the heights of her approval.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout four oÃ¢\\x80\\x99clock on that same afternoon Katharine Hilbery was walking\\r\\nup Kingsway. The question of tea presented itself. The street lamps were\\r\\nbeing lit already, and as she stood still for a moment beneath one of\\r\\nthem, she tried to think of some neighboring drawing-room where there\\r\\nwould be firelight and talk congenial to her mood. That mood, owing to\\r\\nthe spinning traffic and the evening veil of unreality, was ill-adapted\\r\\nto her home surroundings. Perhaps, on the whole, a shop was the best\\r\\nplace in which to preserve this queer sense of heightened existence.\\r\\nAt the same time she wished to talk. Remembering Mary Datchet and her\\r\\nrepeated invitations, she crossed the road, turned into Russell Square,\\r\\nand peered about, seeking for numbers with a sense of adventure that was\\r\\nout of all proportion to the deed itself. She found herself in a dimly\\r\\nlighted hall, unguarded by a porter, and pushed open the first swing\\r\\ndoor. But the office-boy had never heard of Miss Datchet. Did she belong\\r\\nto the S.R.F.R.? Katharine shook her head with a smile of dismay. A\\r\\nvoice from within shouted, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo. The S.G.S.--top floor.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine mounted past innumerable glass doors, with initials on them,\\r\\nand became steadily more and more doubtful of the wisdom of her venture.\\r\\nAt the top she paused for a moment to breathe and collect herself.\\r\\nShe heard the typewriter and formal professional voices inside, not\\r\\nbelonging, she thought, to any one she had ever spoken to. She touched\\r\\nthe bell, and the door was opened almost immediately by Mary herself.\\r\\nHer face had to change its expression entirely when she saw Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe thought you were the printer.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Still holding\\r\\nthe door open, she called back, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo, Mr. Clacton, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not Penningtons.\\r\\nI should ring them up again--double three double eight, Central. Well,\\r\\nthis is a surprise. Come in,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re just in time for tea.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe light of relief shone in MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eyes. The boredom of the afternoon\\r\\nwas dissipated at once, and she was glad that Katharine had found them\\r\\nin a momentary press of activity, owing to the failure of the printer to\\r\\nsend back certain proofs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unshaded electric light shining upon the table covered with papers\\r\\ndazed Katharine for a moment. After the confusion of her twilight walk,\\r\\nand her random thoughts, life in this small room appeared extremely\\r\\nconcentrated and bright. She turned instinctively to look out of the\\r\\nwindow, which was uncurtained, but Mary immediately recalled her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt was very clever of you to find your way,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, and Katharine\\r\\nwondered, as she stood there, feeling, for the moment, entirely detached\\r\\nand unabsorbed, why she had come. She looked, indeed, to MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eyes\\r\\nstrangely out of place in the office. Her figure in the long cloak,\\r\\nwhich took deep folds, and her face, which was composed into a mask of\\r\\nsensitive apprehension, disturbed Mary for a moment with a sense of\\r\\nthe presence of some one who was of another world, and, therefore,\\r\\nsubversive of her world. She became immediately anxious that Katharine\\r\\nshould be impressed by the importance of her world, and hoped that\\r\\nneither Mrs. Seal nor Mr. Clacton would appear until the impression of\\r\\nimportance had been received. But in this she was disappointed. Mrs.\\r\\nSeal burst into the room holding a kettle in her hand, which she set\\r\\nupon the stove, and then, with inefficient haste, she set light to the\\r\\ngas, which flared up, exploded, and went out.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAlways the way, always the way,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she muttered. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cKit Markham is the only\\r\\nperson who knows how to deal with the thing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had to go to her help, and together they spread the table, and\\r\\napologized for the disparity between the cups and the plainness of the\\r\\nfood.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf we had known Miss Hilbery was coming, we should have bought a cake,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Mary, upon which Mrs. Seal looked at Katharine for the first time,\\r\\nsuspiciously, because she was a person who needed cake.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Mr. Clacton opened the door, and came in, holding a typewritten\\r\\nletter in his hand, which he was reading aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSalfordÃ¢\\x80\\x99s affiliated,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell done, Salford!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Seal exclaimed enthusiastically, thumping the\\r\\nteapot which she held upon the table, in token of applause.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, these provincial centers seem to be coming into line at last,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Mr. Clacton, and then Mary introduced him to Miss Hilbery, and\\r\\nhe asked her, in a very formal manner, if she were interested Ã¢\\x80\\x9cin our\\r\\nwork.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd the proofs still not come?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Seal, putting both her elbows\\r\\non the table, and propping her chin on her hands, as Mary began to pour\\r\\nout tea. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s too bad--too bad. At this rate we shall miss the\\r\\ncountry post. Which reminds me, Mr. Clacton, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you think we should\\r\\ncircularize the provinces with PartridgeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s last speech? What? YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve not\\r\\nread it? Oh, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the best thing theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve had in the House this Session.\\r\\nEven the Prime Minister--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mary cut her short.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t allow shop at tea, Sally,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said firmly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe fine her a\\r\\npenny each time she forgets, and the fines go to buying a plum cake,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she explained, seeking to draw Katharine into the community. She had\\r\\ngiven up all hope of impressing her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sorry, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sorry,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Seal apologized. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s my misfortune to be\\r\\nan enthusiast,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, turning to Katharine. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMy fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s daughter\\r\\ncould hardly be anything else. I think IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been on as many committees\\r\\nas most people. Waifs and Strays, Rescue Work, Church Work, C. O.\\r\\nS.--local branch--besides the usual civic duties which fall to one as a\\r\\nhouseholder. But IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve given them all up for our work here, and I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nregret it for a second,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThis is the root question, I feel;\\r\\nuntil women have votes--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be sixpence, at least, Sally,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, bringing her fist down\\r\\non the table. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re all sick to death of women and their votes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Seal looked for a moment as though she could hardly believe her\\r\\nears, and made a deprecating Ã¢\\x80\\x9ctut-tut-tutÃ¢\\x80\\x9d in her throat, looking\\r\\nalternately at Katharine and Mary, and shaking her head as she did so.\\r\\nThen she remarked, rather confidentially to Katharine, with a little nod\\r\\nin MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s direction:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s doing more for the cause than any of us. SheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s giving her\\r\\nyouth--for, alas! when I was young there were domestic circumstances--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she sighed, and stopped short.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Clacton hastily reverted to the joke about luncheon, and explained\\r\\nhow Mrs. Seal fed on a bag of biscuits under the trees, whatever the\\r\\nweather might be, rather, Katharine thought, as though Mrs. Seal were a\\r\\npet dog who had convenient tricks.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I took my little bag into the square,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Seal, with the\\r\\nself-conscious guilt of a child owning some fault to its elders. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt was\\r\\nreally very sustaining, and the bare boughs against the sky do one\\r\\nso much GOOD. But I shall have to give up going into the square,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nproceeded, wrinkling her forehead. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe injustice of it! Why should I\\r\\nhave a beautiful square all to myself, when poor women who need rest\\r\\nhave nowhere at all to sit?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She looked fiercely at Katharine, giving\\r\\nher short locks a little shake. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s dreadful what a tyrant one still\\r\\nis, in spite of all oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s efforts. One tries to lead a decent life,\\r\\nbut one canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t. Of course, directly one thinks of it, one sees that ALL\\r\\nsquares should be open to EVERY ONE. Is there any society with that\\r\\nobject, Mr. Clacton? If not, there should be, surely.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA most excellent object,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Clacton in his professional manner.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt the same time, one must deplore the ramification of organizations,\\r\\nMrs. Seal. So much excellent effort thrown away, not to speak of pounds,\\r\\nshillings, and pence. Now how many organizations of a philanthropic\\r\\nnature do you suppose there are in the City of London itself, Miss\\r\\nHilbery?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, screwing his mouth into a queer little smile, as if\\r\\nto show that the question had its frivolous side.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine smiled, too. Her unlikeness to the rest of them had, by this\\r\\ntime, penetrated to Mr. Clacton, who was not naturally observant, and\\r\\nhe was wondering who she was; this same unlikeness had subtly stimulated\\r\\nMrs. Seal to try and make a convert of her. Mary, too, looked at her\\r\\nalmost as if she begged her to make things easy. For Katharine had shown\\r\\nno disposition to make things easy. She had scarcely spoken, and her\\r\\nsilence, though grave and even thoughtful, seemed to Mary the silence of\\r\\none who criticizes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, there are more in this house than IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d any notion of,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOn the ground floor you protect natives, on the next you emigrate women\\r\\nand tell people to eat nuts--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy do you say that Ã¢\\x80\\x98weÃ¢\\x80\\x99 do these things?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary interposed, rather\\r\\nsharply. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWeÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not responsible for all the cranks who choose to lodge\\r\\nin the same house with us.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Clacton cleared his throat and looked at each of the young ladies\\r\\nin turn. He was a good deal struck by the appearance and manner of Miss\\r\\nHilbery, which seemed to him to place her among those cultivated and\\r\\nluxurious people of whom he used to dream. Mary, on the other hand, was\\r\\nmore of his own sort, and a little too much inclined to order him about.\\r\\nHe picked up crumbs of dry biscuit and put them into his mouth with\\r\\nincredible rapidity.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t belong to our society, then?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Seal.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, with such ready candor that\\r\\nMrs. Seal was nonplussed, and stared at her with a puzzled expression,\\r\\nas if she could not classify her among the varieties of human beings\\r\\nknown to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut surely,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she began.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMrs. Seal is an enthusiast in these matters,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Clacton, almost\\r\\napologetically. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe have to remind her sometimes that others have a\\r\\nright to their views even if they differ from our own.... Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPunchÃ¢\\x80\\x9d has\\r\\na very funny picture this week, about a Suffragist and an agricultural\\r\\nlaborer. Have you seen this weekÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPunch,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Miss Datchet?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary laughed, and said Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Clacton then told them the substance of the joke, which, however,\\r\\ndepended a good deal for its success upon the expression which the\\r\\nartist had put into the peopleÃ¢\\x80\\x99s faces. Mrs. Seal sat all the time\\r\\nperfectly grave. Directly he had done speaking she burst out:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut surely, if you care about the welfare of your sex at all, you must\\r\\nwish them to have the vote?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI never said I didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t wish them to have the vote,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine protested.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen why arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you a member of our society?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Seal demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine stirred her spoon round and round, stared into the swirl of\\r\\nthe tea, and remained silent. Mr. Clacton, meanwhile, framed a question\\r\\nwhich, after a momentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s hesitation, he put to Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you in any way related, I wonder, to the poet Alardyce? His\\r\\ndaughter, I believe, married a Mr. Hilbery.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes; IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m the poetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s granddaughter,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, with a little sigh,\\r\\nafter a pause; and for a moment they were all silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe poetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s granddaughter!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Seal repeated, half to herself, with a\\r\\nshake of her head, as if that explained what was otherwise inexplicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe light kindled in Mr. ClactonÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, indeed. That interests me very much,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI owe a great debt\\r\\nto your grandfather, Miss Hilbery. At one time I could have repeated\\r\\nthe greater part of him by heart. But one gets out of the way of reading\\r\\npoetry, unfortunately. You donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t remember him, I suppose?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA sharp rap at the door made KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s answer inaudible. Mrs. Seal\\r\\nlooked up with renewed hope in her eyes, and exclaiming:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe proofs at last!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d ran to open the door. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s only Mr. Denham!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she cried, without any attempt to conceal her disappointment. Ralph,\\r\\nKatharine supposed, was a frequent visitor, for the only person he\\r\\nthought it necessary to greet was herself, and Mary at once explained\\r\\nthe strange fact of her being there by saying:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine has come to see how one runs an office.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph felt himself stiffen uncomfortably, as he said:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI hope Mary hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t persuaded you that she knows how to run an office?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat, doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t she?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, looking from one to the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these remarks Mrs. Seal began to exhibit signs of discomposure, which\\r\\ndisplayed themselves by a tossing movement of her head, and, as Ralph\\r\\ntook a letter from his pocket, and placed his finger upon a certain\\r\\nsentence, she forestalled him by exclaiming in confusion:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, I know what youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re going to say, Mr. Denham! But it was the\\r\\nday Kit Markham was here, and she upsets one so--with her wonderful\\r\\nvitality, always thinking of something new that we ought to be doing and\\r\\narenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t--and I was conscious at the time that my dates were mixed. It had\\r\\nnothing to do with Mary at all, I assure you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear Sally, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t apologize,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, laughing. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMen are such\\r\\npedants--they donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know what things matter, and what things donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Denham, speak up for our sex,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Clacton in a jocular\\r\\nmanner, indeed, but like most insignificant men he was very quick to\\r\\nresent being found fault with by a woman, in argument with whom he was\\r\\nfond of calling himself Ã¢\\x80\\x9ca mere man.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He wished, however, to enter into\\r\\na literary conservation with Miss Hilbery, and thus let the matter drop.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDoesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it seem strange to you, Miss Hilbery,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat the\\r\\nFrench, with all their wealth of illustrious names, have no poet who can\\r\\ncompare with your grandfather? Let me see. ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Chenier and Hugo\\r\\nand Alfred de Musset--wonderful men, but, at the same time, thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a\\r\\nrichness, a freshness about Alardyce--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the telephone bell rang, and he had to absent himself with a smile\\r\\nand a bow which signified that, although literature is delightful, it\\r\\nis not work. Mrs. Seal rose at the same time, but remained hovering over\\r\\nthe table, delivering herself of a tirade against party government. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFor\\r\\nif I were to tell you what I know of back-stairs intrigue, and what can\\r\\nbe done by the power of the purse, you wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t credit me, Mr. Denham,\\r\\nyou wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t, indeed. Which is why I feel that the only work for my\\r\\nfatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s daughter--for he was one of the pioneers, Mr. Denham, and on\\r\\nhis tombstone I had that verse from the Psalms put, about the sowers\\r\\nand the seed.... And what wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t I give that he should be alive now,\\r\\nseeing what weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re going to see--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but reflecting that the glories of the\\r\\nfuture depended in part upon the activity of her typewriter, she bobbed\\r\\nher head, and hurried back to the seclusion of her little room, from\\r\\nwhich immediately issued sounds of enthusiastic, but obviously erratic,\\r\\ncomposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary made it clear at once, by starting a fresh topic of general\\r\\ninterest, that though she saw the humor of her colleague, she did not\\r\\nintend to have her laughed at.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe standard of morality seems to me frightfully low,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she observed\\r\\nreflectively, pouring out a second cup of tea, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cespecially among women\\r\\nwho arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t well educated. They donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see that small things matter,\\r\\nand thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s where the leakage begins, and then we find ourselves in\\r\\ndifficulties--I very nearly lost my temper yesterday,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went on,\\r\\nlooking at Ralph with a little smile, as though he knew what happened\\r\\nwhen she lost her temper. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt makes me very angry when people tell me\\r\\nlies--doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it make you angry?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut considering that every one tells lies,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine remarked, looking\\r\\nabout the room to see where she had put down her umbrella and her\\r\\nparcel, for there was an intimacy in the way in which Mary and Ralph\\r\\naddressed each other which made her wish to leave them. Mary, on the\\r\\nother hand, was anxious, superficially at least, that Katharine should\\r\\nstay and so fortify her in her determination not to be in love with\\r\\nRalph.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph, while lifting his cup from his lips to the table, had made up his\\r\\nmind that if Miss Hilbery left, he would go with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think that I tell lies, and I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think that Ralph tells\\r\\nlies, do you, Ralph?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine laughed, with more gayety, as it seemed to Mary, than\\r\\nshe could properly account for. What was she laughing at? At them,\\r\\npresumably. Katharine had risen, and was glancing hither and thither, at\\r\\nthe presses and the cupboards, and all the machinery of the office, as\\r\\nif she included them all in her rather malicious amusement, which caused\\r\\nMary to keep her eyes on her straightly and rather fiercely, as if she\\r\\nwere a gay-plumed, mischievous bird, who might light on the topmost\\r\\nbough and pick off the ruddiest cherry, without any warning. Two women\\r\\nless like each other could scarcely be imagined, Ralph thought, looking\\r\\nfrom one to the other. Next moment, he too, rose, and nodding to Mary,\\r\\nas Katharine said good-bye, opened the door for her, and followed her\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary sat still and made no attempt to prevent them from going. For a\\r\\nsecond or two after the door had shut on them her eyes rested on the\\r\\ndoor with a straightforward fierceness in which, for a moment, a certain\\r\\ndegree of bewilderment seemed to enter; but, after a brief hesitation,\\r\\nshe put down her cup and proceeded to clear away the tea-things.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe impulse which had driven Ralph to take this action was the result of\\r\\na very swift little piece of reasoning, and thus, perhaps, was not quite\\r\\nso much of an impulse as it seemed. It passed through his mind that if\\r\\nhe missed this chance of talking to Katharine, he would have to face\\r\\nan enraged ghost, when he was alone in his room again, demanding an\\r\\nexplanation of his cowardly indecision. It was better, on the whole, to\\r\\nrisk present discomfiture than to waste an evening bandying excuses\\r\\nand constructing impossible scenes with this uncompromising section of\\r\\nhimself. For ever since he had visited the Hilberys he had been much at\\r\\nthe mercy of a phantom Katharine, who came to him when he sat alone, and\\r\\nanswered him as he would have her answer, and was always beside him to\\r\\ncrown those varying triumphs which were transacted almost every night,\\r\\nin imaginary scenes, as he walked through the lamplit streets home from\\r\\nthe office. To walk with Katharine in the flesh would either feed that\\r\\nphantom with fresh food, which, as all who nourish dreams are aware, is\\r\\na process that becomes necessary from time to time, or refine it to such\\r\\na degree of thinness that it was scarcely serviceable any longer; and\\r\\nthat, too, is sometimes a welcome change to a dreamer. And all the time\\r\\nRalph was well aware that the bulk of Katharine was not represented in\\r\\nhis dreams at all, so that when he met her he was bewildered by the fact\\r\\nthat she had nothing to do with his dream of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, on reaching the street, Katharine found that Mr. Denham proceeded\\r\\nto keep pace by her side, she was surprised and, perhaps, a little\\r\\nannoyed. She, too, had her margin of imagination, and to-night her\\r\\nactivity in this obscure region of the mind required solitude. If she\\r\\nhad had her way, she would have walked very fast down the Tottenham\\r\\nCourt Road, and then sprung into a cab and raced swiftly home. The view\\r\\nshe had had of the inside of an office was of the nature of a dream to\\r\\nher. Shut off up there, she compared Mrs. Seal, and Mary Datchet, and\\r\\nMr. Clacton to enchanted people in a bewitched tower, with the spidersÃ¢\\x80\\x99\\r\\nwebs looping across the corners of the room, and all the tools of the\\r\\nnecromancerÃ¢\\x80\\x99s craft at hand; for so aloof and unreal and apart from\\r\\nthe normal world did they seem to her, in the house of innumerable\\r\\ntypewriters, murmuring their incantations and concocting their drugs,\\r\\nand flinging their frail spidersÃ¢\\x80\\x99 webs over the torrent of life which\\r\\nrushed down the streets outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe may have been conscious that there was some exaggeration in this\\r\\nfancy of hers, for she certainly did not wish to share it with Ralph.\\r\\nTo him, she supposed, Mary Datchet, composing leaflets for Cabinet\\r\\nMinisters among her typewriters, represented all that was interesting\\r\\nand genuine; and, accordingly, she shut them both out from all share\\r\\nin the crowded street, with its pendant necklace of lamps, its lighted\\r\\nwindows, and its throng of men and women, which exhilarated her to such\\r\\nan extent that she very nearly forgot her companion. She walked very\\r\\nfast, and the effect of people passing in the opposite direction was\\r\\nto produce a queer dizziness both in her head and in RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s, which set\\r\\ntheir bodies far apart. But she did her duty by her companion almost\\r\\nunconsciously.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMary Datchet does that sort of work very well.... SheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s responsible for\\r\\nit, I suppose?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. The others donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t help at all.... Has she made a convert of you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh no. That is, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m a convert already.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut she hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t persuaded you to work for them?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh dear no--that wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t do at all.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they walked on down the Tottenham Court Road, parting and coming\\r\\ntogether again, and Ralph felt much as though he were addressing the\\r\\nsummit of a poplar in a high gale of wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSuppose we get on to that omnibus?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine acquiesced, and they climbed up, and found themselves alone on\\r\\ntop of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut which way are you going?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine asked, waking a little from the\\r\\ntrance into which movement among moving things had thrown her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m going to the Temple,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph replied, inventing a destination on the\\r\\nspur of the moment. He felt the change come over her as they sat down\\r\\nand the omnibus began to move forward. He imagined her contemplating the\\r\\navenue in front of them with those honest sad eyes which seemed to set\\r\\nhim at such a distance from them. But the breeze was blowing in their\\r\\nfaces; it lifted her hat for a second, and she drew out a pin and stuck\\r\\nit in again,--a little action which seemed, for some reason, to make her\\r\\nrather more fallible. Ah, if only her hat would blow off, and leave her\\r\\naltogether disheveled, accepting it from his hands!\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is like Venice,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she observed, raising her hand. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe motor-cars,\\r\\nI mean, shooting about so quickly, with their lights.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve never seen Venice,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI keep that and some other things\\r\\nfor my old age.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat are the other things?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Venice and India and, I think, Dante, too.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThink of providing for oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s old age! And would you refuse to see\\r\\nVenice if you had the chance?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of answering her, he wondered whether he should tell her\\r\\nsomething that was quite true about himself; and as he wondered, he told\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve planned out my life in sections ever since I was a child, to make\\r\\nit last longer. You see, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m always afraid that IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m missing something--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd so am I!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut, after all,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhy\\r\\nshould you miss anything?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy? Because IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m poor, for one thing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph rejoined. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou, I suppose,\\r\\ncan have Venice and India and Dante every day of your life.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said nothing for a moment, but rested one hand, which was bare\\r\\nof glove, upon the rail in front of her, meditating upon a variety of\\r\\nthings, of which one was that this strange young man pronounced Dante\\r\\nas she was used to hearing it pronounced, and another, that he had, most\\r\\nunexpectedly, a feeling about life that was familiar to her. Perhaps,\\r\\nthen, he was the sort of person she might take an interest in, if she\\r\\ncame to know him better, and as she had placed him among those whom she\\r\\nwould never want to know better, this was enough to make her silent.\\r\\nShe hastily recalled her first view of him, in the little room where\\r\\nthe relics were kept, and ran a bar through half her impressions, as one\\r\\ncancels a badly written sentence, having found the right one.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut to know that one might have things doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t alter the fact that one\\r\\nhasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t got them,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, in some confusion. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow could I go to India,\\r\\nfor example? Besides,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she began impulsively, and stopped herself. Here\\r\\nthe conductor came round, and interrupted them. Ralph waited for her to\\r\\nresume her sentence, but she said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have a message to give your father,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he remarked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you would\\r\\ngive it him, or I could come--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, do come,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cStill, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see why you shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t go to India,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph began, in\\r\\norder to keep her from rising, as she threatened to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she got up in spite of him, and said good-bye with her usual air of\\r\\ndecision, and left him with a quickness which Ralph connected now with\\r\\nall her movements. He looked down and saw her standing on the pavement\\r\\nedge, an alert, commanding figure, which waited its season to cross,\\r\\nand then walked boldly and swiftly to the other side. That gesture and\\r\\naction would be added to the picture he had of her, but at present the\\r\\nreal woman completely routed the phantom one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd little Augustus Pelham said to me, Ã¢\\x80\\x98ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the younger generation\\r\\nknocking at the door,Ã¢\\x80\\x99 and I said to him, Ã¢\\x80\\x98Oh, but the younger\\r\\ngeneration comes in without knocking, Mr. Pelham.Ã¢\\x80\\x99 Such a feeble little\\r\\njoke, wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it, but down it went into his notebook all the same.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLet us congratulate ourselves that we shall be in the grave before that\\r\\nwork is published,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Hilbery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elderly couple were waiting for the dinner-bell to ring and for\\r\\ntheir daughter to come into the room. Their arm-chairs were drawn up\\r\\non either side of the fire, and each sat in the same slightly crouched\\r\\nposition, looking into the coals, with the expressions of people who\\r\\nhave had their share of experiences and wait, rather passively, for\\r\\nsomething to happen. Mr. Hilbery now gave all his attention to a piece\\r\\nof coal which had fallen out of the grate, and to selecting a favorable\\r\\nposition for it among the lumps that were burning already. Mrs. Hilbery\\r\\nwatched him in silence, and the smile changed on her lips as if her mind\\r\\nstill played with the events of the afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr. Hilbery had accomplished his task, he resumed his crouching\\r\\nposition again, and began to toy with the little green stone attached to\\r\\nhis watch-chain. His deep, oval-shaped eyes were fixed upon the flames,\\r\\nbut behind the superficial glaze seemed to brood an observant and\\r\\nwhimsical spirit, which kept the brown of the eye still unusually vivid.\\r\\nBut a look of indolence, the result of skepticism or of a taste too\\r\\nfastidious to be satisfied by the prizes and conclusions so easily\\r\\nwithin his grasp, lent him an expression almost of melancholy. After\\r\\nsitting thus for a time, he seemed to reach some point in his thinking\\r\\nwhich demonstrated its futility, upon which he sighed and stretched his\\r\\nhand for a book lying on the table by his side.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirectly the door opened he closed the book, and the eyes of father\\r\\nand mother both rested on Katharine as she came towards them. The sight\\r\\nseemed at once to give them a motive which they had not had before.\\r\\nTo them she appeared, as she walked towards them in her light evening\\r\\ndress, extremely young, and the sight of her refreshed them, were it\\r\\nonly because her youth and ignorance made their knowledge of the world\\r\\nof some value.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe only excuse for you, Katharine, is that dinner is still later than\\r\\nyou are,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Hilbery, putting down his spectacles.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mind her being late when the result is so charming,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.\\r\\nHilbery, looking with pride at her daughter. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cStill, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know that I\\r\\nLIKE your being out so late, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou took a cab,\\r\\nI hope?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere dinner was announced, and Mr. Hilbery formally led his wife\\r\\ndownstairs on his arm. They were all dressed for dinner, and, indeed,\\r\\nthe prettiness of the dinner-table merited that compliment. There was\\r\\nno cloth upon the table, and the china made regular circles of deep blue\\r\\nupon the shining brown wood. In the middle there was a bowl of tawny\\r\\nred and yellow chrysanthemums, and one of pure white, so fresh that the\\r\\nnarrow petals were curved backwards into a firm white ball. From the\\r\\nsurrounding walls the heads of three famous Victorian writers surveyed\\r\\nthis entertainment, and slips of paper pasted beneath them testified\\r\\nin the great manÃ¢\\x80\\x99s own handwriting that he was yours sincerely or\\r\\naffectionately or for ever. The father and daughter would have been\\r\\nquite content, apparently, to eat their dinner in silence, or with a few\\r\\ncryptic remarks expressed in a shorthand which could not be understood\\r\\nby the servants. But silence depressed Mrs. Hilbery, and far from\\r\\nminding the presence of maids, she would often address herself to them,\\r\\nand was never altogether unconscious of their approval or disapproval of\\r\\nher remarks. In the first place she called them to witness that the room\\r\\nwas darker than usual, and had all the lights turned on.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s more cheerful,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDÃ¢\\x80\\x99you know, Katharine, that\\r\\nridiculous goose came to tea with me? Oh, how I wanted you! He tried to\\r\\nmake epigrams all the time, and I got so nervous, expecting them, you\\r\\nknow, that I spilt the tea--and he made an epigram about that!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich ridiculous goose?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine asked her father.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOnly one of my geese, happily, makes epigrams--Augustus Pelham, of\\r\\ncourse,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Hilbery.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not sorry that I was out,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPoor Augustus!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re all too hard on him.\\r\\nRemember how devoted he is to his tiresome old mother.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s only because she is his mother. Any one connected with\\r\\nhimself--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no, Katharine--thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s too bad. ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s--whatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the word I mean,\\r\\nTrevor, something long and Latin--the sort of word you and Katharine\\r\\nknow--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hilbery suggested Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccynical.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll do. I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe in sending girls to college, but I\\r\\nshould teach them that sort of thing. It makes one feel so dignified,\\r\\nbringing out these little allusions, and passing on gracefully to the\\r\\nnext topic. But I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know whatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s come over me--I actually had to ask\\r\\nAugustus the name of the lady Hamlet was in love with, as you were out,\\r\\nKatharine, and Heaven knows what he maynÃ¢\\x80\\x99t put down about me in his\\r\\ndiary.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wish,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine started, with great impetuosity, and checked\\r\\nherself. Her mother always stirred her to feel and think quickly, and\\r\\nthen she remembered that her father was there, listening with attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is it you wish?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked, as she paused.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe often surprised her, thus, into telling him what she had not meant to\\r\\ntell him; and then they argued, while Mrs. Hilbery went on with her own\\r\\nthoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wish mother wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t famous. I was out at tea, and they would talk to\\r\\nme about poetry.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThinking you must be poetical, I see--and arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhoÃ¢\\x80\\x99s been talking to you about poetry, Katharine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery\\r\\ndemanded, and Katharine was committed to giving her parents an account\\r\\nof her visit to the Suffrage office.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey have an office at the top of one of the old houses in Russell\\r\\nSquare. I never saw such queer-looking people. And the man discovered\\r\\nI was related to the poet, and talked to me about poetry. Even Mary\\r\\nDatchet seems different in that atmosphere.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, the office atmosphere is very bad for the soul,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Hilbery.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t remember any offices in Russell Square in the old days, when\\r\\nMamma lived there,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery mused, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t fancy turning one\\r\\nof those noble great rooms into a stuffy little Suffrage office. Still,\\r\\nif the clerks read poetry there must be something nice about them.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, because they donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t read it as we read it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine insisted.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s nice to think of them reading your grandfather, and not\\r\\nfilling up those dreadful little forms all day long,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery\\r\\npersisted, her notion of office life being derived from some chance view\\r\\nof a scene behind the counter at her bank, as she slipped the sovereigns\\r\\ninto her purse.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt any rate, they havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t made a convert of Katharine, which was what I\\r\\nwas afraid of,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hilbery remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh no,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine very decidedly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t work with them for\\r\\nanything.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s curious,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hilbery continued, agreeing with his daughter, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow\\r\\nthe sight of oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s fellow-enthusiasts always chokes one off. They\\r\\nshow up the faults of oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s cause so much more plainly than oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nantagonists. One can be enthusiastic in oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s study, but directly one\\r\\ncomes into touch with the people who agree with one, all the glamor\\r\\ngoes. So IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve always found,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and he proceeded to tell them, as he peeled\\r\\nhis apple, how he committed himself once, in his youthful days, to make\\r\\na speech at a political meeting, and went there ablaze with enthusiasm\\r\\nfor the ideals of his own side; but while his leaders spoke, he became\\r\\ngradually converted to the other way of thinking, if thinking it could\\r\\nbe called, and had to feign illness in order to avoid making a fool of\\r\\nhimself--an experience which had sickened him of public meetings.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine listened and felt as she generally did when her father, and\\r\\nto some extent her mother, described their feelings, that she quite\\r\\nunderstood and agreed with them, but, at the same time, saw something\\r\\nwhich they did not see, and always felt some disappointment when they\\r\\nfell short of her vision, as they always did. The plates succeeded each\\r\\nother swiftly and noiselessly in front of her, and the table was decked\\r\\nfor dessert, and as the talk murmured on in familiar grooves, she sat\\r\\nthere, rather like a judge, listening to her parents, who did, indeed,\\r\\nfeel it very pleasant when they made her laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nDaily life in a house where there are young and old is full of curious\\r\\nlittle ceremonies and pieties, which are discharged quite punctually,\\r\\nthough the meaning of them is obscure, and a mystery has come to brood\\r\\nover them which lends even a superstitious charm to their performance.\\r\\nSuch was the nightly ceremony of the cigar and the glass of port, which\\r\\nwere placed on the right hand and on the left hand of Mr. Hilbery, and\\r\\nsimultaneously Mrs. Hilbery and Katharine left the room. All the years\\r\\nthey had lived together they had never seen Mr. Hilbery smoke his cigar\\r\\nor drink his port, and they would have felt it unseemly if, by chance,\\r\\nthey had surprised him as he sat there. These short, but clearly marked,\\r\\nperiods of separation between the sexes were always used for an intimate\\r\\npostscript to what had been said at dinner, the sense of being women\\r\\ntogether coming out most strongly when the male sex was, as if by some\\r\\nreligious rite, secluded from the female. Katharine knew by heart\\r\\nthe sort of mood that possessed her as she walked upstairs to the\\r\\ndrawing-room, her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s arm in hers; and she could anticipate the\\r\\npleasure with which, when she had turned on the lights, they both\\r\\nregarded the drawing-room, fresh swept and set in order for the\\r\\nlast section of the day, with the red parrots swinging on the chintz\\r\\ncurtains, and the arm-chairs warming in the blaze. Mrs. Hilbery stood\\r\\nover the fire, with one foot on the fender, and her skirts slightly\\r\\nraised.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve made me think of Mamma and\\r\\nthe old days in Russell Square! I can see the chandeliers, and the\\r\\ngreen silk of the piano, and Mamma sitting in her cashmere shawl by\\r\\nthe window, singing till the little ragamuffin boys outside stopped to\\r\\nlisten. Papa sent me in with a bunch of violets while he waited round\\r\\nthe corner. It must have been a summer evening. That was before things\\r\\nwere hopeless....Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she spoke an expression of regret, which must have come frequently to\\r\\ncause the lines which now grew deep round the lips and eyes, settled on\\r\\nher face. The poetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s marriage had not been a happy one. He had left his\\r\\nwife, and after some years of a rather reckless existence, she had\\r\\ndied, before her time. This disaster had led to great irregularities\\r\\nof education, and, indeed, Mrs. Hilbery might be said to have escaped\\r\\neducation altogether. But she had been her fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s companion at the\\r\\nseason when he wrote the finest of his poems. She had sat on his knee in\\r\\ntaverns and other haunts of drunken poets, and it was for her sake, so\\r\\npeople said, that he had cured himself of his dissipation, and become\\r\\nthe irreproachable literary character that the world knows, whose\\r\\ninspiration had deserted him. As Mrs. Hilbery grew old she thought more\\r\\nand more of the past, and this ancient disaster seemed at times almost\\r\\nto prey upon her mind, as if she could not pass out of life herself\\r\\nwithout laying the ghost of her parentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sorrow to rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine wished to comfort her mother, but it was difficult to do this\\r\\nsatisfactorily when the facts themselves were so much of a legend. The\\r\\nhouse in Russell Square, for example, with its noble rooms, and the\\r\\nmagnolia-tree in the garden, and the sweet-voiced piano, and the sound\\r\\nof feet coming down the corridors, and other properties of size and\\r\\nromance--had they any existence? Yet why should Mrs. Alardyce live all\\r\\nalone in this gigantic mansion, and, if she did not live alone, with\\r\\nwhom did she live? For its own sake, Katharine rather liked this tragic\\r\\nstory, and would have been glad to hear the details of it, and to have\\r\\nbeen able to discuss them frankly. But this it became less and less\\r\\npossible to do, for though Mrs. Hilbery was constantly reverting to the\\r\\nstory, it was always in this tentative and restless fashion, as though\\r\\nby a touch here and there she could set things straight which had been\\r\\ncrooked these sixty years. Perhaps, indeed, she no longer knew what the\\r\\ntruth was.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99d lived now,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she concluded, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI feel it wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have happened.\\r\\nPeople arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t so set upon tragedy as they were then. If my father had\\r\\nbeen able to go round the world, or if sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99d had a rest cure, everything\\r\\nwould have come right. But what could I do? And then they had bad\\r\\nfriends, both of them, who made mischief. Ah, Katharine, when you marry,\\r\\nbe quite, quite sure that you love your husband!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tears stood in Mrs. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile comforting her, Katharine thought to herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow this is what\\r\\nMary Datchet and Mr. Denham donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand. This is the sort of\\r\\nposition IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m always getting into. How simple it must be to live as they\\r\\ndo!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d for all the evening she had been comparing her home and her father\\r\\nand mother with the Suffrage office and the people there.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery continued, with one of her sudden changes\\r\\nof mood, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthough, Heaven knows, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to see you married,\\r\\nsurely if ever a man loved a woman, William loves you. And itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a nice,\\r\\nrich-sounding name too--Katharine Rodney, which, unfortunately, doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nmean that heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s got any money, because he hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe alteration of her name annoyed Katharine, and she observed, rather\\r\\nsharply, that she didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to marry any one.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s very dull that you can only marry one husband, certainly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs.\\r\\nHilbery reflected. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI always wish that you could marry everybody who\\r\\nwants to marry you. Perhaps theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll come to that in time, but meanwhile\\r\\nI confess that dear William--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d But here Mr. Hilbery came in, and the\\r\\nmore solid part of the evening began. This consisted in the reading\\r\\naloud by Katharine from some prose work or other, while her mother\\r\\nknitted scarves intermittently on a little circular frame, and her\\r\\nfather read the newspaper, not so attentively but that he could comment\\r\\nhumorously now and again upon the fortunes of the hero and the heroine.\\r\\nThe Hilberys subscribed to a library, which delivered books on Tuesdays\\r\\nand Fridays, and Katharine did her best to interest her parents in the\\r\\nworks of living and highly respectable authors; but Mrs. Hilbery was\\r\\nperturbed by the very look of the light, gold-wreathed volumes, and\\r\\nwould make little faces as if she tasted something bitter as the reading\\r\\nwent on; while Mr. Hilbery would treat the moderns with a curious\\r\\nelaborate banter such as one might apply to the antics of a promising\\r\\nchild. So this evening, after five pages or so of one of these masters,\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery protested that it was all too clever and cheap and nasty\\r\\nfor words.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPlease, Katharine, read us something REAL.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine had to go to the bookcase and choose a portly volume in sleek,\\r\\nyellow calf, which had directly a sedative effect upon both her parents.\\r\\nBut the delivery of the evening post broke in upon the periods of Henry\\r\\nFielding, and Katharine found that her letters needed all her attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took her letters up to her room with her, having persuaded her\\r\\nmother to go to bed directly Mr. Hilbery left them, for so long as she\\r\\nsat in the same room as her mother, Mrs. Hilbery might, at any moment,\\r\\nask for a sight of the post. A very hasty glance through many sheets\\r\\nhad shown Katharine that, by some coincidence, her attention had to be\\r\\ndirected to many different anxieties simultaneously. In the first place,\\r\\nRodney had written a very full account of his state of mind, which was\\r\\nillustrated by a sonnet, and he demanded a reconsideration of their\\r\\nposition, which agitated Katharine more than she liked. Then there were\\r\\ntwo letters which had to be laid side by side and compared before she\\r\\ncould make out the truth of their story, and even when she knew the\\r\\nfacts she could not decide what to make of them; and finally she had\\r\\nto reflect upon a great many pages from a cousin who found himself in\\r\\nfinancial difficulties, which forced him to the uncongenial occupation\\r\\nof teaching the young ladies of Bungay to play upon the violin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the two letters which each told the same story differently were the\\r\\nchief source of her perplexity. She was really rather shocked to find it\\r\\ndefinitely established that her own second cousin, Cyril Alardyce, had\\r\\nlived for the last four years with a woman who was not his wife, who\\r\\nhad borne him two children, and was now about to bear him another. This\\r\\nstate of things had been discovered by Mrs. Milvain, her aunt Celia,\\r\\na zealous inquirer into such matters, whose letter was also under\\r\\nconsideration. Cyril, she said, must be made to marry the woman at once;\\r\\nand Cyril, rightly or wrongly, was indignant with such interference with\\r\\nhis affairs, and would not own that he had any cause to be ashamed of\\r\\nhimself. Had he any cause to be ashamed of himself, Katharine wondered;\\r\\nand she turned to her aunt again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRemember,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she wrote, in her profuse, emphatic statement, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat he\\r\\nbears your grandfatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s name, and so will the child that is to be\\r\\nborn. The poor boy is not so much to blame as the woman who deluded him,\\r\\nthinking him a gentleman, which he IS, and having money, which he has\\r\\nNOT.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat would Ralph Denham say to this?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d thought Katharine, beginning to\\r\\npace up and down her bedroom. She twitched aside the curtains, so that,\\r\\non turning, she was faced by darkness, and looking out, could just\\r\\ndistinguish the branches of a plane-tree and the yellow lights of some\\r\\none elseÃ¢\\x80\\x99s windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat would Mary Datchet and Ralph Denham say?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she reflected, pausing\\r\\nby the window, which, as the night was warm, she raised, in order to\\r\\nfeel the air upon her face, and to lose herself in the nothingness of\\r\\nnight. But with the air the distant humming sound of far-off crowded\\r\\nthoroughfares was admitted to the room. The incessant and tumultuous\\r\\nhum of the distant traffic seemed, as she stood there, to represent\\r\\nthe thick texture of her life, for her life was so hemmed in with the\\r\\nprogress of other lives that the sound of its own advance was inaudible.\\r\\nPeople like Ralph and Mary, she thought, had it all their own way, and\\r\\nan empty space before them, and, as she envied them, she cast her mind\\r\\nout to imagine an empty land where all this petty intercourse of men and\\r\\nwomen, this life made up of the dense crossings and entanglements of men\\r\\nand women, had no existence whatever. Even now, alone, at night, looking\\r\\nout into the shapeless mass of London, she was forced to remember that\\r\\nthere was one point and here another with which she had some connection.\\r\\nWilliam Rodney, at this very moment, was seated in a minute speck of\\r\\nlight somewhere to the east of her, and his mind was occupied, not with\\r\\nhis book, but with her. She wished that no one in the whole world\\r\\nwould think of her. However, there was no way of escaping from oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nfellow-beings, she concluded, and shut the window with a sigh, and\\r\\nreturned once more to her letters.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not doubt but that WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s letter was the most genuine she\\r\\nhad yet received from him. He had come to the conclusion that he could\\r\\nnot live without her, he wrote. He believed that he knew her, and\\r\\ncould give her happiness, and that their marriage would be unlike other\\r\\nmarriages. Nor was the sonnet, in spite of its accomplishment, lacking\\r\\nin passion, and Katharine, as she read the pages through again, could\\r\\nsee in what direction her feelings ought to flow, supposing they\\r\\nrevealed themselves. She would come to feel a humorous sort of\\r\\ntenderness for him, a zealous care for his susceptibilities, and, after\\r\\nall, she considered, thinking of her father and mother, what is love?\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally, with her face, position, and background, she had experience\\r\\nof young men who wished to marry her, and made protestations of love,\\r\\nbut, perhaps because she did not return the feeling, it remained\\r\\nsomething of a pageant to her. Not having experience of it herself, her\\r\\nmind had unconsciously occupied itself for some years in dressing up an\\r\\nimage of love, and the marriage that was the outcome of love, and the\\r\\nman who inspired love, which naturally dwarfed any examples that came\\r\\nher way. Easily, and without correction by reason, her imagination made\\r\\npictures, superb backgrounds casting a rich though phantom light upon\\r\\nthe facts in the foreground. Splendid as the waters that drop with\\r\\nresounding thunder from high ledges of rock, and plunge downwards into\\r\\nthe blue depths of night, was the presence of love she dreamt, drawing\\r\\ninto it every drop of the force of life, and dashing them all asunder in\\r\\nthe superb catastrophe in which everything was surrendered, and nothing\\r\\nmight be reclaimed. The man, too, was some magnanimous hero, riding a\\r\\ngreat horse by the shore of the sea. They rode through forests together,\\r\\nthey galloped by the rim of the sea. But waking, she was able to\\r\\ncontemplate a perfectly loveless marriage, as the thing one did actually\\r\\nin real life, for possibly the people who dream thus are those who do\\r\\nthe most prosaic things.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment she was much inclined to sit on into the night, spinning\\r\\nher light fabric of thoughts until she tired of their futility, and went\\r\\nto her mathematics; but, as she knew very well, it was necessary that\\r\\nshe should see her father before he went to bed. The case of Cyril\\r\\nAlardyce must be discussed, her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s illusions and the rights of the\\r\\nfamily attended to. Being vague herself as to what all this amounted\\r\\nto, she had to take counsel with her father. She took her letters in her\\r\\nhand and went downstairs. It was past eleven, and the clocks had\\r\\ncome into their reign, the grandfatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s clock in the hall ticking in\\r\\ncompetition with the small clock on the landing. Mr. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s study ran\\r\\nout behind the rest of the house, on the ground floor, and was a very\\r\\nsilent, subterranean place, the sun in daytime casting a mere abstract\\r\\nof light through a skylight upon his books and the large table, with its\\r\\nspread of white papers, now illumined by a green reading-lamp. Here Mr.\\r\\nHilbery sat editing his review, or placing together documents by means\\r\\nof which it could be proved that Shelley had written Ã¢\\x80\\x9cofÃ¢\\x80\\x9d instead of\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cand,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d or that the inn in which Byron had slept was called the Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNagÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nHeadÃ¢\\x80\\x9d and not the Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTurkish Knight,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d or that the Christian name of\\r\\nKeatsÃ¢\\x80\\x99s uncle had been John rather than Richard, for he knew more minute\\r\\ndetails about these poets than any man in England, probably, and was\\r\\npreparing an edition of Shelley which scrupulously observed the poetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsystem of punctuation. He saw the humor of these researches, but that\\r\\ndid not prevent him from carrying them out with the utmost scrupulosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was lying back comfortably in a deep arm-chair smoking a cigar, and\\r\\nruminating the fruitful question as to whether Coleridge had wished to\\r\\nmarry Dorothy Wordsworth, and what, if he had done so, would have been\\r\\nthe consequences to him in particular, and to literature in general.\\r\\nWhen Katharine came in he reflected that he knew what she had come for,\\r\\nand he made a pencil note before he spoke to her. Having done this, he\\r\\nsaw that she was reading, and he watched her for a moment without saying\\r\\nanything. She was reading Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIsabella and the Pot of Basil,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and her mind\\r\\nwas full of the Italian hills and the blue daylight, and the hedges set\\r\\nwith little rosettes of red and white roses. Feeling that her father\\r\\nwaited for her, she sighed and said, shutting her book:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve had a letter from Aunt Celia about Cyril, father.... It seems to\\r\\nbe true--about his marriage. What are we to do?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCyril seems to have been behaving in a very foolish manner,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr.\\r\\nHilbery, in his pleasant and deliberate tones.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine found some difficulty in carrying on the conversation, while\\r\\nher father balanced his finger-tips so judiciously, and seemed to\\r\\nreserve so many of his thoughts for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s about done for himself, I should say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he continued. Without\\r\\nsaying anything, he took KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s letters out of her hand, adjusted\\r\\nhis eyeglasses, and read them through.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length he said Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHumph!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and gave the letters back to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMother knows nothing about it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine remarked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWill you tell\\r\\nher?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI shall tell your mother. But I shall tell her that there is nothing\\r\\nwhatever for us to do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut the marriage?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine asked, with some diffidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hilbery said nothing, and stared into the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat in the name of conscience did he do it for?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he speculated at\\r\\nlast, rather to himself than to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine had begun to read her auntÃ¢\\x80\\x99s letter over again, and she now\\r\\nquoted a sentence. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIbsen and Butler.... He has sent me a letter full of\\r\\nquotations--nonsense, though clever nonsense.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, if the younger generation want to carry on its life on those\\r\\nlines, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s none of our affair,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it our affair, perhaps, to make them get married?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine\\r\\nasked rather wearily.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy the dickens should they apply to me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d her father demanded with\\r\\nsudden irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOnly as the head of the family--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not the head of the family. AlfredÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the head of the family.\\r\\nLet them apply to Alfred,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Hilbery, relapsing again into his\\r\\narm-chair. Katharine was aware that she had touched a sensitive spot,\\r\\nhowever, in mentioning the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think, perhaps, the best thing would be for me to go and see them,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have you going anywhere near them,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hilbery replied with\\r\\nunwonted decision and authority. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIndeed, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand why theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\ndragged you into the business at all--I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see that itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s got anything\\r\\nto do with you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve always been friends with Cyril,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut did he ever tell you anything about this?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hilbery asked rather\\r\\nsharply.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine shook her head. She was, indeed, a good deal hurt that Cyril\\r\\nhad not confided in her--did he think, as Ralph Denham or Mary Datchet\\r\\nmight think, that she was, for some reason, unsympathetic--hostile even?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs to your mother,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Hilbery, after a pause, in which he seemed\\r\\nto be considering the color of the flames, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou had better tell her the\\r\\nfacts. SheÃ¢\\x80\\x99d better know the facts before every one begins to talk about\\r\\nit, though why Aunt Celia thinks it necessary to come, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nknow. And the less talk there is the better.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGranting the assumption that gentlemen of sixty who are highly\\r\\ncultivated, and have had much experience of life, probably think of many\\r\\nthings which they do not say, Katharine could not help feeling rather\\r\\npuzzled by her fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s attitude, as she went back to her room. What a\\r\\ndistance he was from it all! How superficially he smoothed these events\\r\\ninto a semblance of decency which harmonized with his own view of life!\\r\\nHe never wondered what Cyril had felt, nor did the hidden aspects of the\\r\\ncase tempt him to examine into them. He merely seemed to realize, rather\\r\\nlanguidly, that Cyril had behaved in a way which was foolish, because\\r\\nother people did not behave in that way. He seemed to be looking through\\r\\na telescope at little figures hundreds of miles in the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer selfish anxiety not to have to tell Mrs. Hilbery what had happened\\r\\nmade her follow her father into the hall after breakfast the next\\r\\nmorning in order to question him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you told mother?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked. Her manner to her father was almost\\r\\nstern, and she seemed to hold endless depths of reflection in the dark\\r\\nof her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hilbery sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear child, it went out of my head.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He smoothed his silk hat\\r\\nenergetically, and at once affected an air of hurry. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll send a note\\r\\nround from the office.... IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m late this morning, and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve any amount of\\r\\nproofs to get through.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t do at all,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine said decidedly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe must be\\r\\ntold--you or I must tell her. We ought to have told her at first.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hilbery had now placed his hat on his head, and his hand was on the\\r\\ndoor-knob. An expression which Katharine knew well from her childhood,\\r\\nwhen he asked her to shield him in some neglect of duty, came into his\\r\\neyes; malice, humor, and irresponsibility were blended in it. He nodded\\r\\nhis head to and fro significantly, opened the door with an adroit\\r\\nmovement, and stepped out with a lightness unexpected at his age. He\\r\\nwaved his hand once to his daughter, and was gone. Left alone, Katharine\\r\\ncould not help laughing to find herself cheated as usual in domestic\\r\\nbargainings with her father, and left to do the disagreeable work which\\r\\nbelonged, by rights, to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine disliked telling her mother about CyrilÃ¢\\x80\\x99s misbehavior quite as\\r\\nmuch as her father did, and for much the same reasons. They both shrank,\\r\\nnervously, as people fear the report of a gun on the stage, from all\\r\\nthat would have to be said on this occasion. Katharine, moreover, was\\r\\nunable to decide what she thought of CyrilÃ¢\\x80\\x99s misbehavior. As usual, she\\r\\nsaw something which her father and mother did not see, and the effect of\\r\\nthat something was to suspend CyrilÃ¢\\x80\\x99s behavior in her mind without any\\r\\nqualification at all. They would think whether it was good or bad; to\\r\\nher it was merely a thing that had happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Katharine reached the study, Mrs. Hilbery had already dipped her\\r\\npen in the ink.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, lifting it in the air, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve just made out such\\r\\na queer, strange thing about your grandfather. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m three years and six\\r\\nmonths older than he was when he died. I couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t very well have been\\r\\nhis mother, but I might have been his elder sister, and that seems to me\\r\\nsuch a pleasant fancy. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m going to start quite fresh this morning, and\\r\\nget a lot done.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began her sentence, at any rate, and Katharine sat down at her own\\r\\ntable, untied the bundle of old letters upon which she was working,\\r\\nsmoothed them out absent-mindedly, and began to decipher the faded\\r\\nscript. In a minute she looked across at her mother, to judge her mood.\\r\\nPeace and happiness had relaxed every muscle in her face; her lips\\r\\nwere parted very slightly, and her breath came in smooth, controlled\\r\\ninspirations like those of a child who is surrounding itself with a\\r\\nbuilding of bricks, and increasing in ecstasy as each brick is placed in\\r\\nposition. So Mrs. Hilbery was raising round her the skies and trees of\\r\\nthe past with every stroke of her pen, and recalling the voices of\\r\\nthe dead. Quiet as the room was, and undisturbed by the sounds of the\\r\\npresent moment, Katharine could fancy that here was a deep pool of past\\r\\ntime, and that she and her mother were bathed in the light of sixty\\r\\nyears ago. What could the present give, she wondered, to compare with\\r\\nthe rich crowd of gifts bestowed by the past? Here was a Thursday\\r\\nmorning in process of manufacture; each second was minted fresh by the\\r\\nclock upon the mantelpiece. She strained her ears and could just hear,\\r\\nfar off, the hoot of a motor-car and the rush of wheels coming nearer\\r\\nand dying away again, and the voices of men crying old iron and\\r\\nvegetables in one of the poorer streets at the back of the house. Rooms,\\r\\nof course, accumulate their suggestions, and any room in which one has\\r\\nbeen used to carry on any particular occupation gives off memories\\r\\nof moods, of ideas, of postures that have been seen in it; so that to\\r\\nattempt any different kind of work there is almost impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine was unconsciously affected, each time she entered her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nroom, by all these influences, which had had their birth years ago,\\r\\nwhen she was a child, and had something sweet and solemn about them,\\r\\nand connected themselves with early memories of the cavernous glooms and\\r\\nsonorous echoes of the Abbey where her grandfather lay buried. All the\\r\\nbooks and pictures, even the chairs and tables, had belonged to him,\\r\\nor had reference to him; even the china dogs on the mantelpiece and the\\r\\nlittle shepherdesses with their sheep had been bought by him for a penny\\r\\na piece from a man who used to stand with a tray of toys in Kensington\\r\\nHigh Street, as Katharine had often heard her mother tell. Often she\\r\\nhad sat in this room, with her mind fixed so firmly on those vanished\\r\\nfigures that she could almost see the muscles round their eyes and lips,\\r\\nand had given to each his own voice, with its tricks of accent, and his\\r\\ncoat and his cravat. Often she had seemed to herself to be moving among\\r\\nthem, an invisible ghost among the living, better acquainted with them\\r\\nthan with her own friends, because she knew their secrets and possessed\\r\\na divine foreknowledge of their destiny. They had been so unhappy, such\\r\\nmuddlers, so wrong-headed, it seemed to her. She could have told them\\r\\nwhat to do, and what not to do. It was a melancholy fact that they\\r\\nwould pay no heed to her, and were bound to come to grief in their own\\r\\nantiquated way. Their behavior was often grotesquely irrational; their\\r\\nconventions monstrously absurd; and yet, as she brooded upon them, she\\r\\nfelt so closely attached to them that it was useless to try to pass\\r\\njudgment upon them. She very nearly lost consciousness that she was\\r\\na separate being, with a future of her own. On a morning of slight\\r\\ndepression, such as this, she would try to find some sort of clue to the\\r\\nmuddle which their old letters presented; some reason which seemed\\r\\nto make it worth while to them; some aim which they kept steadily in\\r\\nview--but she was interrupted.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery had risen from her table, and was standing looking out of\\r\\nthe window at a string of barges swimming up the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine watched her. Suddenly Mrs. Hilbery turned abruptly, and\\r\\nexclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI really believe IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m bewitched! I only want three sentences, you see,\\r\\nsomething quite straightforward and commonplace, and I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t find Ã¢\\x80\\x98em.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began to pace up and down the room, snatching up her duster; but she\\r\\nwas too much annoyed to find any relief, as yet, in polishing the backs\\r\\nof books.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBesides,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, giving the sheet she had written to Katharine, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\ndonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe thisÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll do. Did your grandfather ever visit the Hebrides,\\r\\nKatharine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She looked in a strangely beseeching way at her daughter.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy mind got running on the Hebrides, and I couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t help writing a\\r\\nlittle description of them. Perhaps it would do at the beginning of a\\r\\nchapter. Chapters often begin quite differently from the way they go on,\\r\\nyou know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine read what her mother had written. She might have\\r\\nbeen a schoolmaster criticizing a childÃ¢\\x80\\x99s essay. Her face gave Mrs.\\r\\nHilbery, who watched it anxiously, no ground for hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s very beautiful,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she stated, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut, you see, mother, we ought to go\\r\\nfrom point to point--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, I know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s just what I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t do.\\r\\nThings keep coming into my head. It isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t that I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know everything\\r\\nand feel everything (who did know him, if I didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t?), but I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t put\\r\\nit down, you see. ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a kind of blind spot,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, touching her\\r\\nforehead, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthere. And when I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t sleep oÃ¢\\x80\\x99 nights, I fancy I shall die\\r\\nwithout having done it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom exultation she had passed to the depths of depression which the\\r\\nimagination of her death aroused. The depression communicated itself\\r\\nto Katharine. How impotent they were, fiddling about all day long with\\r\\npapers! And the clock was striking eleven and nothing done! She watched\\r\\nher mother, now rummaging in a great brass-bound box which stood by her\\r\\ntable, but she did not go to her help. Of course, Katharine reflected,\\r\\nher mother had now lost some paper, and they would waste the rest of the\\r\\nmorning looking for it. She cast her eyes down in irritation, and read\\r\\nagain her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s musical sentences about the silver gulls, and the\\r\\nroots of little pink flowers washed by pellucid streams, and the blue\\r\\nmists of hyacinths, until she was struck by her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s silence. She\\r\\nraised her eyes. Mrs. Hilbery had emptied a portfolio containing old\\r\\nphotographs over her table, and was looking from one to another.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSurely, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe men were far handsomer in those days\\r\\nthan they are now, in spite of their odious whiskers? Look at old John\\r\\nGraham, in his white waistcoat--look at Uncle Harley. ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Peter the\\r\\nmanservant, I suppose. Uncle John brought him back from India.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine looked at her mother, but did not stir or answer. She had\\r\\nsuddenly become very angry, with a rage which their relationship made\\r\\nsilent, and therefore doubly powerful and critical. She felt all the\\r\\nunfairness of the claim which her mother tacitly made to her time and\\r\\nsympathy, and what Mrs. Hilbery took, Katharine thought bitterly, she\\r\\nwasted. Then, in a flash, she remembered that she had still to tell her\\r\\nabout CyrilÃ¢\\x80\\x99s misbehavior. Her anger immediately dissipated itself; it\\r\\nbroke like some wave that has gathered itself high above the rest; the\\r\\nwaters were resumed into the sea again, and Katharine felt once more\\r\\nfull of peace and solicitude, and anxious only that her mother should be\\r\\nprotected from pain. She crossed the room instinctively, and sat on\\r\\nthe arm of her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s chair. Mrs. Hilbery leant her head against her\\r\\ndaughterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s body.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is nobler,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she mused, turning over the photographs, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthan to be\\r\\na woman to whom every one turns, in sorrow or difficulty? How have the\\r\\nyoung women of your generation improved upon that, Katharine? I can see\\r\\nthem now, sweeping over the lawns at Melbury House, in their flounces\\r\\nand furbelows, so calm and stately and imperial (and the monkey and\\r\\nthe little black dwarf following behind), as if nothing mattered in\\r\\nthe world but to be beautiful and kind. But they did more than we do, I\\r\\nsometimes think. They WERE, and thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s better than doing. They seem to\\r\\nme like ships, like majestic ships, holding on their way, not shoving or\\r\\npushing, not fretted by little things, as we are, but taking their way,\\r\\nlike ships with white sails.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine tried to interrupt this discourse, but the opportunity did not\\r\\ncome, and she could not forbear to turn over the pages of the album in\\r\\nwhich the old photographs were stored. The faces of these men and women\\r\\nshone forth wonderfully after the hubbub of living faces, and seemed,\\r\\nas her mother had said, to wear a marvelous dignity and calm, as if they\\r\\nhad ruled their kingdoms justly and deserved great love. Some were of\\r\\nalmost incredible beauty, others were ugly enough in a forcible way, but\\r\\nnone were dull or bored or insignificant. The superb stiff folds of the\\r\\ncrinolines suited the women; the cloaks and hats of the gentlemen seemed\\r\\nfull of character. Once more Katharine felt the serene air all round\\r\\nher, and seemed far off to hear the solemn beating of the sea upon the\\r\\nshore. But she knew that she must join the present on to this past.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery was rambling on, from story to story.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Janie Mannering,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, pointing to a superb, white-haired\\r\\ndame, whose satin robes seemed strung with pearls. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI must have told you\\r\\nhow she found her cook drunk under the kitchen table when the Empress\\r\\nwas coming to dinner, and tucked up her velvet sleeves (she always\\r\\ndressed like an Empress herself), cooked the whole meal, and appeared in\\r\\nthe drawing-room as if sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99d been sleeping on a bank of roses all day.\\r\\nShe could do anything with her hands--they all could--make a cottage or\\r\\nembroider a petticoat.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Queenie Colquhoun,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went on, turning the pages, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwho\\r\\ntook her coffin out with her to Jamaica, packed with lovely shawls and\\r\\nbonnets, because you couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t get coffins in Jamaica, and she had a\\r\\nhorror of dying there (as she did), and being devoured by the white\\r\\nants. And thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Sabine, the loveliest of them all; ah! it was like\\r\\na star rising when she came into the room. And thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Miriam, in her\\r\\ncoachmanÃ¢\\x80\\x99s cloak, with all the little capes on, and she wore great\\r\\ntop-boots underneath. You young people may say youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re unconventional,\\r\\nbut youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re nothing compared with her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning the page, she came upon the picture of a very masculine,\\r\\nhandsome lady, whose head the photographer had adorned with an imperial\\r\\ncrown.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, you wretch!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat a wicked old despot you\\r\\nwere, in your day! How we all bowed down before you! Ã¢\\x80\\x98Maggie,Ã¢\\x80\\x99 she used\\r\\nto say, Ã¢\\x80\\x98if it hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t been for me, where would you be now?Ã¢\\x80\\x99 And it was\\r\\ntrue; she brought them together, you know. She said to my father, Ã¢\\x80\\x98Marry\\r\\nher,Ã¢\\x80\\x99 and he did; and she said to poor little Clara, Ã¢\\x80\\x98Fall down and\\r\\nworship him,Ã¢\\x80\\x99 and she did; but she got up again, of course. What else\\r\\ncould one expect? She was a mere child--eighteen--and half dead with\\r\\nfright, too. But that old tyrant never repented. She used to say that\\r\\nshe had given them three perfect months, and no one had a right to more;\\r\\nand I sometimes think, Katharine, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s true, you know. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s more than\\r\\nmost of us have, only we have to pretend, which was a thing neither of\\r\\nthem could ever do. I fancy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery mused, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat there was a kind\\r\\nof sincerity in those days between men and women which, with all your\\r\\noutspokenness, you havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t got.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine again tried to interrupt. But Mrs. Hilbery had been gathering\\r\\nimpetus from her recollections, and was now in high spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey must have been good friends at heart,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she resumed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbecause she\\r\\nused to sing his songs. Ah, how did it go?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and Mrs. Hilbery, who had a\\r\\nvery sweet voice, trolled out a famous lyric of her fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s which had\\r\\nbeen set to an absurdly and charmingly sentimental air by some early\\r\\nVictorian composer.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the vitality of them!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she concluded, striking her fist against\\r\\nthe table. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what we havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t got! WeÃ¢\\x80\\x99re virtuous, weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re earnest,\\r\\nwe go to meetings, we pay the poor their wages, but we donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t live as\\r\\nthey lived. As often as not, my father wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t in bed three nights out\\r\\nof the seven, but always fresh as paint in the morning. I hear him now,\\r\\ncome singing up the stairs to the nursery, and tossing the loaf\\r\\nfor breakfast on his sword-stick, and then off we went for a dayÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npleasuring--Richmond, Hampton Court, the Surrey Hills. Why shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t we\\r\\ngo, Katharine? ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s going to be a fine day.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment, just as Mrs. Hilbery was examining the weather from the\\r\\nwindow, there was a knock at the door. A slight, elderly lady came in,\\r\\nand was saluted by Katharine, with very evident dismay, as Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAunt Celia!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n She was dismayed because she guessed why Aunt Celia had come. It was\\r\\ncertainly in order to discuss the case of Cyril and the woman who was\\r\\nnot his wife, and owing to her procrastination Mrs. Hilbery was quite\\r\\nunprepared. Who could be more unprepared? Here she was, suggesting that\\r\\nall three of them should go on a jaunt to Blackfriars to inspect the\\r\\nsite of ShakespeareÃ¢\\x80\\x99s theater, for the weather was hardly settled enough\\r\\nfor the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this proposal Mrs. Milvain listened with a patient smile, which\\r\\nindicated that for many years she had accepted such eccentricities in\\r\\nher sister-in-law with bland philosophy. Katharine took up her position\\r\\nat some distance, standing with her foot on the fender, as though by so\\r\\ndoing she could get a better view of the matter. But, in spite of her\\r\\nauntÃ¢\\x80\\x99s presence, how unreal the whole question of Cyril and his morality\\r\\nappeared! The difficulty, it now seemed, was not to break the news\\r\\ngently to Mrs. Hilbery, but to make her understand it. How was one\\r\\nto lasso her mind, and tether it to this minute, unimportant spot? A\\r\\nmatter-of-fact statement seemed best.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think Aunt Celia has come to talk about Cyril, mother,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said\\r\\nrather brutally. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAunt Celia has discovered that Cyril is married. He\\r\\nhas a wife and children.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, he is NOT married,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Milvain interposed, in low tones,\\r\\naddressing herself to Mrs. Hilbery. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe has two children, and another on\\r\\nthe way.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery looked from one to the other in bewilderment.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe thought it better to wait until it was proved before we told you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Katharine added.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut I met Cyril only a fortnight ago at the National Gallery!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs.\\r\\nHilbery exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe a word of it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and she tossed her\\r\\nhead with a smile on her lips at Mrs. Milvain, as though she could quite\\r\\nunderstand her mistake, which was a very natural mistake, in the case of\\r\\na childless woman, whose husband was something very dull in the Board of\\r\\nTrade.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t WISH to believe it, Maggie,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Milvain. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFor a long\\r\\ntime I COULDNÃ¢\\x80\\x99T believe it. But now IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve seen, and I HAVE to believe\\r\\nit.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery demanded, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdoes your father know of this?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCyril married!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery repeated. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd never telling us a word,\\r\\nthough weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve had him in our house since he was a child--noble WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nson! I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe my ears!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFeeling that the burden of proof was laid upon her, Mrs. Milvain\\r\\nnow proceeded with her story. She was elderly and fragile, but her\\r\\nchildlessness seemed always to impose these painful duties on her, and\\r\\nto revere the family, and to keep it in repair, had now become the chief\\r\\nobject of her life. She told her story in a low, spasmodic, and somewhat\\r\\nbroken voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have suspected for some time that he was not happy. There were new\\r\\nlines on his face. So I went to his rooms, when I knew he was engaged\\r\\nat the poor menÃ¢\\x80\\x99s college. He lectures there--Roman law, you know, or it\\r\\nmay be Greek. The landlady said Mr. Alardyce only slept there about once\\r\\na fortnight now. He looked so ill, she said. She had seen him with a\\r\\nyoung person. I suspected something directly. I went to his room, and\\r\\nthere was an envelope on the mantelpiece, and a letter with an address\\r\\nin Seton Street, off the Kennington Road.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery fidgeted rather restlessly, and hummed fragments of her\\r\\ntune, as if to interrupt.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI went to Seton Street,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Aunt Celia continued firmly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA very low\\r\\nplace--lodging-houses, you know, with canaries in the window. Number\\r\\nseven just like all the others. I rang, I knocked; no one came. I went\\r\\ndown the area. I am certain I saw some one inside--children--a cradle.\\r\\nBut no reply--no reply.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She sighed, and looked straight in front of her\\r\\nwith a glazed expression in her half-veiled blue eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI stood in the street,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she resumed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cin case I could catch a sight of\\r\\none of them. It seemed a very long time. There were rough men singing\\r\\nin the public-house round the corner. At last the door opened, and some\\r\\none--it must have been the woman herself--came right past me. There was\\r\\nonly the pillar-box between us.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd what did she look like?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOne could see how the poor boy had been deluded,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d was all that Mrs.\\r\\nMilvain vouchsafed by way of description.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPoor thing!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPoor Cyril!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Milvain said, laying a slight emphasis upon Cyril.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got nothing to live upon,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery continued. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf heÃ¢\\x80\\x99d\\r\\ncome to us like a man,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went on, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand said, Ã¢\\x80\\x98IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been a fool,Ã¢\\x80\\x99 one\\r\\nwould have pitied him; one would have tried to help him. ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s nothing\\r\\nso disgraceful after all--But heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s been going about all these years,\\r\\npretending, letting one take it for granted, that he was single. And the\\r\\npoor deserted little wife--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe is NOT his wife,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Aunt Celia interrupted.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve never heard anything so detestable!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery wound up,\\r\\nstriking her fist on the arm of her chair. As she realized the facts she\\r\\nbecame thoroughly disgusted, although, perhaps, she was more hurt by\\r\\nthe concealment of the sin than by the sin itself. She looked splendidly\\r\\nroused and indignant; and Katharine felt an immense relief and pride in\\r\\nher mother. It was plain that her indignation was very genuine, and\\r\\nthat her mind was as perfectly focused upon the facts as any one could\\r\\nwish--more so, by a long way, than Aunt CeliaÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mind, which seemed to\\r\\nbe timidly circling, with a morbid pleasure, in these unpleasant shades.\\r\\nShe and her mother together would take the situation in hand, visit\\r\\nCyril, and see the whole thing through.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe must realize CyrilÃ¢\\x80\\x99s point of view first,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, speaking\\r\\ndirectly to her mother, as if to a contemporary, but before the words\\r\\nwere out of her mouth, there was more confusion outside, and Cousin\\r\\nCaroline, Mrs. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s maiden cousin, entered the room. Although she\\r\\nwas by birth an Alardyce, and Aunt Celia a Hilbery, the complexities of\\r\\nthe family relationship were such that each was at once first and second\\r\\ncousin to the other, and thus aunt and cousin to the culprit Cyril, so\\r\\nthat his misbehavior was almost as much Cousin CarolineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s affair as\\r\\nAunt CeliaÃ¢\\x80\\x99s. Cousin Caroline was a lady of very imposing height and\\r\\ncircumference, but in spite of her size and her handsome trappings,\\r\\nthere was something exposed and unsheltered in her expression, as if\\r\\nfor many summers her thin red skin and hooked nose and reduplication of\\r\\nchins, so much resembling the profile of a cockatoo, had been bared to\\r\\nthe weather; she was, indeed, a single lady; but she had, it was the\\r\\nhabit to say, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmade a life for herself,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and was thus entitled to be\\r\\nheard with respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis unhappy business,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she began, out of breath as she was. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf the\\r\\ntrain had not gone out of the station just as I arrived, I should have\\r\\nbeen with you before. Celia has doubtless told you. You will agree with\\r\\nme, Maggie. He must be made to marry her at once for the sake of the\\r\\nchildren--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut does he refuse to marry her?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery inquired, with a return\\r\\nof her bewilderment.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe has written an absurd perverted letter, all quotations,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cousin\\r\\nCaroline puffed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe thinks heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s doing a very fine thing, where we only\\r\\nsee the folly of it.... The girlÃ¢\\x80\\x99s every bit as infatuated as he is--for\\r\\nwhich I blame him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe entangled him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Aunt Celia intervened, with a very curious\\r\\nsmoothness of intonation, which seemed to convey a vision of threads\\r\\nweaving and interweaving a close, white mesh round their victim.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no use going into the rights and wrongs of the affair now, Celia,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Cousin Caroline with some acerbity, for she believed herself the\\r\\nonly practical one of the family, and regretted that, owing to the\\r\\nslowness of the kitchen clock, Mrs. Milvain had already confused\\r\\npoor dear Maggie with her own incomplete version of the facts. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe\\r\\nmischiefÃ¢\\x80\\x99s done, and very ugly mischief too. Are we to allow the third\\r\\nchild to be born out of wedlock? (I am sorry to have to say these things\\r\\nbefore you, Katharine.) He will bear your name, Maggie--your fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nname, remember.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut let us hope it will be a girl,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Hilbery.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine, who had been looking at her mother constantly, while the\\r\\nchatter of tongues held sway, perceived that the look of straightforward\\r\\nindignation had already vanished; her mother was evidently casting\\r\\nabout in her mind for some method of escape, or bright spot, or sudden\\r\\nillumination which should show to the satisfaction of everybody that all\\r\\nhad happened, miraculously but incontestably, for the best.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s detestable--quite detestable!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she repeated, but in tones of no\\r\\ngreat assurance; and then her face lit up with a smile which, tentative\\r\\nat first, soon became almost assured. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNowadays, people donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think\\r\\nso badly of these things as they used to do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she began. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt will be\\r\\nhorribly uncomfortable for them sometimes, but if they are brave, clever\\r\\nchildren, as they will be, I dare say itÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll make remarkable people of\\r\\nthem in the end. Robert Browning used to say that every great man has\\r\\nJewish blood in him, and we must try to look at it in that light. And,\\r\\nafter all, Cyril has acted on principle. One may disagree with\\r\\nhis principle, but, at least, one can respect it--like the French\\r\\nRevolution, or Cromwell cutting the KingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s head off. Some of the most\\r\\nterrible things in history have been done on principle,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she concluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid I take a very different view of principle,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cousin Caroline\\r\\nremarked tartly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPrinciple!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Aunt Celia repeated, with an air of deprecating such a word\\r\\nin such a connection. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI will go to-morrow and see him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut why should you take these disagreeable things upon yourself,\\r\\nCelia?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery interposed, and Cousin Caroline thereupon protested\\r\\nwith some further plan involving sacrifice of herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowing weary of it all, Katharine turned to the window, and stood among\\r\\nthe folds of the curtain, pressing close to the window-pane, and gazing\\r\\ndisconsolately at the river much in the attitude of a child depressed\\r\\nby the meaningless talk of its elders. She was much disappointed in her\\r\\nmother--and in herself too. The little tug which she gave to the blind,\\r\\nletting it fly up to the top with a snap, signified her annoyance. She\\r\\nwas very angry, and yet impotent to give expression to her anger, or\\r\\nknow with whom she was angry. How they talked and moralized and made up\\r\\nstories to suit their own version of the becoming, and secretly praised\\r\\ntheir own devotion and tact! No; they had their dwelling in a mist, she\\r\\ndecided; hundreds of miles away--away from what? Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps it would be\\r\\nbetter if I married William,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought suddenly, and the thought\\r\\nappeared to loom through the mist like solid ground. She stood there,\\r\\nthinking of her own destiny, and the elder ladies talked on, until\\r\\nthey had talked themselves into a decision to ask the young woman to\\r\\nluncheon, and tell her, very friendlily, how such behavior appeared to\\r\\nwomen like themselves, who knew the world. And then Mrs. Hilbery was\\r\\nstruck by a better idea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\nMessrs. Grateley and Hooper, the solicitors in whose firm Ralph Denham\\r\\nwas clerk, had their office in LincolnÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Inn Fields, and there Ralph\\r\\nDenham appeared every morning very punctually at ten oÃ¢\\x80\\x99clock. His\\r\\npunctuality, together with other qualities, marked him out among the\\r\\nclerks for success, and indeed it would have been safe to wager that in\\r\\nten yearsÃ¢\\x80\\x99 time or so one would find him at the head of his profession,\\r\\nhad it not been for a peculiarity which sometimes seemed to make\\r\\neverything about him uncertain and perilous. His sister Joan had already\\r\\nbeen disturbed by his love of gambling with his savings. Scrutinizing\\r\\nhim constantly with the eye of affection, she had become aware of a\\r\\ncurious perversity in his temperament which caused her much anxiety, and\\r\\nwould have caused her still more if she had not recognized the germs\\r\\nof it in her own nature. She could fancy Ralph suddenly sacrificing his\\r\\nentire career for some fantastic imagination; some cause or idea or even\\r\\n(so her fancy ran) for some woman seen from a railway train, hanging up\\r\\nclothes in a back yard. When he had found this beauty or this cause,\\r\\nno force, she knew, would avail to restrain him from pursuit of it. She\\r\\nsuspected the East also, and always fidgeted herself when she saw him\\r\\nwith a book of Indian travels in his hand, as though he were sucking\\r\\ncontagion from the page. On the other hand, no common love affair, had\\r\\nthere been such a thing, would have caused her a momentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s uneasiness\\r\\nwhere Ralph was concerned. He was destined in her fancy for something\\r\\nsplendid in the way of success or failure, she knew not which.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet nobody could have worked harder or done better in all the\\r\\nrecognized stages of a young manÃ¢\\x80\\x99s life than Ralph had done, and Joan\\r\\nhad to gather materials for her fears from trifles in her brotherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbehavior which would have escaped any other eye. It was natural that\\r\\nshe should be anxious. Life had been so arduous for all of them from\\r\\nthe start that she could not help dreading any sudden relaxation of his\\r\\ngrasp upon what he held, though, as she knew from inspection of her own\\r\\nlife, such sudden impulse to let go and make away from the discipline\\r\\nand the drudgery was sometimes almost irresistible. But with Ralph,\\r\\nif he broke away, she knew that it would be only to put himself under\\r\\nharsher constraint; she figured him toiling through sandy deserts under\\r\\na tropical sun to find the source of some river or the haunt of some\\r\\nfly; she figured him living by the labor of his hands in some city slum,\\r\\nthe victim of one of those terrible theories of right and wrong which\\r\\nwere current at the time; she figured him prisoner for life in the house\\r\\nof a woman who had seduced him by her misfortunes. Half proudly, and\\r\\nwholly anxiously, she framed such thoughts, as they sat, late at night,\\r\\ntalking together over the gas-stove in RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is likely that Ralph would not have recognized his own dream of a\\r\\nfuture in the forecasts which disturbed his sisterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s peace of mind.\\r\\nCertainly, if any one of them had been put before him he would have\\r\\nrejected it with a laugh, as the sort of life that held no attractions\\r\\nfor him. He could not have said how it was that he had put these absurd\\r\\nnotions into his sisterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s head. Indeed, he prided himself upon being\\r\\nwell broken into a life of hard work, about which he had no sort of\\r\\nillusions. His vision of his own future, unlike many such forecasts,\\r\\ncould have been made public at any moment without a blush; he attributed\\r\\nto himself a strong brain, and conferred on himself a seat in the House\\r\\nof Commons at the age of fifty, a moderate fortune, and, with luck,\\r\\nan unimportant office in a Liberal Government. There was nothing\\r\\nextravagant in a forecast of that kind, and certainly nothing\\r\\ndishonorable. Nevertheless, as his sister guessed, it needed all RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nstrength of will, together with the pressure of circumstances, to\\r\\nkeep his feet moving in the path which led that way. It needed, in\\r\\nparticular, a constant repetition of a phrase to the effect that he\\r\\nshared the common fate, found it best of all, and wished for no other;\\r\\nand by repeating such phrases he acquired punctuality and habits of\\r\\nwork, and could very plausibly demonstrate that to be a clerk in a\\r\\nsolicitorÃ¢\\x80\\x99s office was the best of all possible lives, and that other\\r\\nambitions were vain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, like all beliefs not genuinely held, this one depended very much\\r\\nupon the amount of acceptance it received from other people, and in\\r\\nprivate, when the pressure of public opinion was removed, Ralph let\\r\\nhimself swing very rapidly away from his actual circumstances upon\\r\\nstrange voyages which, indeed, he would have been ashamed to describe.\\r\\nIn these dreams, of course, he figured in noble and romantic parts, but\\r\\nself-glorification was not the only motive of them. They gave outlet\\r\\nto some spirit which found no work to do in real life, for, with the\\r\\npessimism which his lot forced upon him, Ralph had made up his mind that\\r\\nthere was no use for what, contemptuously enough, he called dreams, in\\r\\nthe world which we inhabit. It sometimes seemed to him that this spirit\\r\\nwas the most valuable possession he had; he thought that by means of\\r\\nit he could set flowering waste tracts of the earth, cure many ills, or\\r\\nraise up beauty where none now existed; it was, too, a fierce and potent\\r\\nspirit which would devour the dusty books and parchments on the office\\r\\nwall with one lick of its tongue, and leave him in a minute standing in\\r\\nnakedness, if he gave way to it. His endeavor, for many years, had been\\r\\nto control the spirit, and at the age of twenty-nine he thought he could\\r\\npride himself upon a life rigidly divided into the hours of work and\\r\\nthose of dreams; the two lived side by side without harming each other.\\r\\nAs a matter of fact, this effort at discipline had been helped by the\\r\\ninterests of a difficult profession, but the old conclusion to which\\r\\nRalph had come when he left college still held sway in his mind, and\\r\\ntinged his views with the melancholy belief that life for most people\\r\\ncompels the exercise of the lower gifts and wastes the precious ones,\\r\\nuntil it forces us to agree that there is little virtue, as well\\r\\nas little profit, in what once seemed to us the noblest part of our\\r\\ninheritance.\\r\\n\\r\\nDenham was not altogether popular either in his office or among his\\r\\nfamily. He was too positive, at this stage of his career, as to what was\\r\\nright and what wrong, too proud of his self-control, and, as is natural\\r\\nin the case of persons not altogether happy or well suited in their\\r\\nconditions, too apt to prove the folly of contentment, if he found\\r\\nany one who confessed to that weakness. In the office his rather\\r\\nostentatious efficiency annoyed those who took their own work more\\r\\nlightly, and, if they foretold his advancement, it was not altogether\\r\\nsympathetically. Indeed, he appeared to be rather a hard and\\r\\nself-sufficient young man, with a queer temper, and manners that were\\r\\nuncompromisingly abrupt, who was consumed with a desire to get on in the\\r\\nworld, which was natural, these critics thought, in a man of no means,\\r\\nbut not engaging.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young men in the office had a perfect right to these opinions,\\r\\nbecause Denham showed no particular desire for their friendship. He\\r\\nliked them well enough, but shut them up in that compartment of life\\r\\nwhich was devoted to work. Hitherto, indeed, he had found little\\r\\ndifficulty in arranging his life as methodically as he arranged his\\r\\nexpenditure, but about this time he began to encounter experiences which\\r\\nwere not so easy to classify. Mary Datchet had begun this confusion two\\r\\nyears ago by bursting into laughter at some remark of his, almost the\\r\\nfirst time they met. She could not explain why it was. She thought him\\r\\nquite astonishingly odd. When he knew her well enough to tell her how he\\r\\nspent Monday and Wednesday and Saturday, she was still more amused; she\\r\\nlaughed till he laughed, too, without knowing why. It seemed to her very\\r\\nodd that he should know as much about breeding bulldogs as any man in\\r\\nEngland; that he had a collection of wild flowers found near London;\\r\\nand his weekly visit to old Miss Trotter at Ealing, who was an authority\\r\\nupon the science of Heraldry, never failed to excite her laughter. She\\r\\nwanted to know everything, even the kind of cake which the old lady\\r\\nsupplied on these occasions; and their summer excursions to churches\\r\\nin the neighborhood of London for the purpose of taking rubbings of the\\r\\nbrasses became most important festivals, from the interest she took in\\r\\nthem. In six months she knew more about his odd friends and hobbies than\\r\\nhis own brothers and sisters knew, after living with him all his life;\\r\\nand Ralph found this very pleasant, though disordering, for his own view\\r\\nof himself had always been profoundly serious.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly it was very pleasant to be with Mary Datchet and to become,\\r\\ndirectly the door was shut, quite a different sort of person, eccentric\\r\\nand lovable, with scarcely any likeness to the self most people knew. He\\r\\nbecame less serious, and rather less dictatorial at home, for he was apt\\r\\nto hear Mary laughing at him, and telling him, as she was fond of doing,\\r\\nthat he knew nothing at all about anything. She made him, also, take an\\r\\ninterest in public questions, for which she had a natural liking; and\\r\\nwas in process of turning him from Tory to Radical, after a course\\r\\nof public meetings, which began by boring him acutely, and ended by\\r\\nexciting him even more than they excited her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he was reserved; when ideas started up in his mind, he divided them\\r\\nautomatically into those he could discuss with Mary, and those he must\\r\\nkeep for himself. She knew this and it interested her, for she was\\r\\naccustomed to find young men very ready to talk about themselves, and\\r\\nhad come to listen to them as one listens to children, without any\\r\\nthought of herself. But with Ralph, she had very little of this\\r\\nmaternal feeling, and, in consequence, a much keener sense of her own\\r\\nindividuality.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate one afternoon Ralph stepped along the Strand to an interview with\\r\\na lawyer upon business. The afternoon light was almost over, and already\\r\\nstreams of greenish and yellowish artificial light were being poured\\r\\ninto an atmosphere which, in country lanes, would now have been soft\\r\\nwith the smoke of wood fires; and on both sides of the road the shop\\r\\nwindows were full of sparkling chains and highly polished leather\\r\\ncases, which stood upon shelves made of thick plate-glass. None of these\\r\\ndifferent objects was seen separately by Denham, but from all of them he\\r\\ndrew an impression of stir and cheerfulness. Thus it came about that he\\r\\nsaw Katharine Hilbery coming towards him, and looked straight at her, as\\r\\nif she were only an illustration of the argument that was going forward\\r\\nin his mind. In this spirit he noticed the rather set expression in\\r\\nher eyes, and the slight, half-conscious movement of her lips, which,\\r\\ntogether with her height and the distinction of her dress, made her look\\r\\nas if the scurrying crowd impeded her, and her direction were different\\r\\nfrom theirs. He noticed this calmly; but suddenly, as he passed her, his\\r\\nhands and knees began to tremble, and his heart beat painfully. She did\\r\\nnot see him, and went on repeating to herself some lines which had stuck\\r\\nto her memory: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s life that matters, nothing but life--the process\\r\\nof discovering--the everlasting and perpetual process, not the discovery\\r\\nitself at all.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Thus occupied, she did not see Denham, and he had not\\r\\nthe courage to stop her. But immediately the whole scene in the Strand\\r\\nwore that curious look of order and purpose which is imparted to the\\r\\nmost heterogeneous things when music sounds; and so pleasant was this\\r\\nimpression that he was very glad that he had not stopped her, after\\r\\nall. It grew slowly fainter, but lasted until he stood outside the\\r\\nbarristerÃ¢\\x80\\x99s chambers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen his interview with the barrister was over, it was too late to go\\r\\nback to the office. His sight of Katharine had put him queerly out of\\r\\ntune for a domestic evening. Where should he go? To walk through the\\r\\nstreets of London until he came to KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s house, to look up at the\\r\\nwindows and fancy her within, seemed to him possible for a moment;\\r\\nand then he rejected the plan almost with a blush as, with a curious\\r\\ndivision of consciousness, one plucks a flower sentimentally and throws\\r\\nit away, with a blush, when it is actually picked. No, he would go and\\r\\nsee Mary Datchet. By this time she would be back from her work.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo see Ralph appear unexpectedly in her room threw Mary for a second off\\r\\nher balance. She had been cleaning knives in her little scullery,\\r\\nand when she had let him in she went back again, and turned on the\\r\\ncold-water tap to its fullest volume, and then turned it off again.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought to herself, as she screwed it tight, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not going\\r\\nto let these silly ideas come into my head.... DonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you think Mr.\\r\\nAsquith deserves to be hanged?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she called back into the sitting-room,\\r\\nand when she joined him, drying her hands, she began to tell him about\\r\\nthe latest evasion on the part of the Government with respect to the\\r\\nWomenÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Suffrage Bill. Ralph did not want to talk about politics, but\\r\\nhe could not help respecting Mary for taking such an interest in public\\r\\nquestions. He looked at her as she leant forward, poking the fire, and\\r\\nexpressing herself very clearly in phrases which bore distantly the\\r\\ntaint of the platform, and he thought, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow absurd Mary would think me\\r\\nif she knew that I almost made up my mind to walk all the way to Chelsea\\r\\nin order to look at KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s windows. She wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand it, but\\r\\nI like her very much as she is.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time they discussed what the women had better do; and as Ralph\\r\\nbecame genuinely interested in the question, Mary unconsciously let\\r\\nher attention wander, and a great desire came over her to talk to Ralph\\r\\nabout her own feelings; or, at any rate, about something personal, so\\r\\nthat she might see what he felt for her; but she resisted this wish. But\\r\\nshe could not prevent him from feeling her lack of interest in what he\\r\\nwas saying, and gradually they both became silent. One thought after\\r\\nanother came up in RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mind, but they were all, in some way,\\r\\nconnected with Katharine, or with vague feelings of romance and\\r\\nadventure such as she inspired. But he could not talk to Mary about such\\r\\nthoughts; and he pitied her for knowing nothing of what he was feeling.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHere,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he thought, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis where we differ from women; they have no sense\\r\\nof romance.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Mary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said at length, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhy donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you say something amusing?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis tone was certainly provoking, but, as a general rule, Mary was not\\r\\neasily provoked. This evening, however, she replied rather sharply:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got nothing amusing to say, I suppose.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph thought for a moment, and then remarked:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou work too hard. I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mean your health,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, as she laughed\\r\\nscornfully, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI mean that you seem to me to be getting wrapped up in your\\r\\nwork.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd is that a bad thing?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked, shading her eyes with her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think it is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut only a week ago you were saying the opposite.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Her tone was\\r\\ndefiant, but she became curiously depressed. Ralph did not perceive it,\\r\\nand took this opportunity of lecturing her, and expressing his latest\\r\\nviews upon the proper conduct of life. She listened, but her main\\r\\nimpression was that he had been meeting some one who had influenced him.\\r\\nHe was telling her that she ought to read more, and to see that\\r\\nthere were other points of view as deserving of attention as her own.\\r\\nNaturally, having last seen him as he left the office in company\\r\\nwith Katharine, she attributed the change to her; it was likely that\\r\\nKatharine, on leaving the scene which she had so clearly despised, had\\r\\npronounced some such criticism, or suggested it by her own attitude.\\r\\nBut she knew that Ralph would never admit that he had been influenced by\\r\\nanybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t read enough, Mary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he was saying. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou ought to read more\\r\\npoetry.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was true that MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s reading had been rather limited to such works\\r\\nas she needed to know for the sake of examinations; and her time for\\r\\nreading in London was very little. For some reason, no one likes to be\\r\\ntold that they do not read enough poetry, but her resentment was only\\r\\nvisible in the way she changed the position of her hands, and in the\\r\\nfixed look in her eyes. And then she thought to herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m behaving\\r\\nexactly as I said I wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t behave,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d whereupon she relaxed all her\\r\\nmuscles and said, in her reasonable way:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTell me what I ought to read, then.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph had unconsciously been irritated by Mary, and he now delivered\\r\\nhimself of a few names of great poets which were the text for a\\r\\ndiscourse upon the imperfection of MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s character and way of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou live with your inferiors,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, warming unreasonably, as he\\r\\nknew, to his text. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd you get into a groove because, on the whole,\\r\\nitÃ¢\\x80\\x99s rather a pleasant groove. And you tend to forget what youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re there\\r\\nfor. YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve the feminine habit of making much of details. You donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see\\r\\nwhen things matter and when they donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t. And thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s whatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the ruin of\\r\\nall these organizations. ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s why the Suffragists have never done\\r\\nanything all these years. WhatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the point of drawing-room meetings and\\r\\nbazaars? You want to have ideas, Mary; get hold of something big; never\\r\\nmind making mistakes, but donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t niggle. Why donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you throw it all up\\r\\nfor a year, and travel?--see something of the world. DonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be content\\r\\nto live with half a dozen people in a backwater all your life. But you\\r\\nwonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he concluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve rather come to that way of thinking myself--about myself, I mean,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Mary, surprising him by her acquiescence. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should like to go\\r\\nsomewhere far away.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment they were both silent. Ralph then said:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut look here, Mary, you havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t been taking this seriously, have you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n His irritation was spent, and the depression, which she could not keep\\r\\nout of her voice, made him feel suddenly with remorse that he had been\\r\\nhurting her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t go away, will you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked. And as she said nothing, he\\r\\nadded, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh no, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t go away.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know exactly what I mean to do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied. She hovered\\r\\non the verge of some discussion of her plans, but she received no\\r\\nencouragement. He fell into one of his queer silences, which seemed to\\r\\nMary, in spite of all her precautions, to have reference to what she\\r\\nalso could not prevent herself from thinking about--their feeling\\r\\nfor each other and their relationship. She felt that the two lines of\\r\\nthought bored their way in long, parallel tunnels which came very close\\r\\nindeed, but never ran into each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had gone, and he left her without breaking his silence more than\\r\\nwas needed to wish her good night, she sat on for a time, reviewing what\\r\\nhe had said. If love is a devastating fire which melts the whole being\\r\\ninto one mountain torrent, Mary was no more in love with Denham than\\r\\nshe was in love with her poker or her tongs. But probably these extreme\\r\\npassions are very rare, and the state of mind thus depicted belongs to\\r\\nthe very last stages of love, when the power to resist has been eaten\\r\\naway, week by week or day by day. Like most intelligent people, Mary\\r\\nwas something of an egoist, to the extent, that is, of attaching great\\r\\nimportance to what she felt, and she was by nature enough of a moralist\\r\\nto like to make certain, from time to time, that her feelings were\\r\\ncreditable to her. When Ralph left her she thought over her state of\\r\\nmind, and came to the conclusion that it would be a good thing to learn\\r\\na language--say Italian or German. She then went to a drawer, which she\\r\\nhad to unlock, and took from it certain deeply scored manuscript pages.\\r\\nShe read them through, looking up from her reading every now and then\\r\\nand thinking very intently for a few seconds about Ralph. She did her\\r\\nbest to verify all the qualities in him which gave rise to emotions in\\r\\nher; and persuaded herself that she accounted reasonably for them all.\\r\\nThen she looked back again at her manuscript, and decided that to write\\r\\ngrammatical English prose is the hardest thing in the world. But\\r\\nshe thought about herself a great deal more than she thought about\\r\\ngrammatical English prose or about Ralph Denham, and it may therefore\\r\\nbe disputed whether she was in love, or, if so, to which branch of the\\r\\nfamily her passion belonged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s life that matters, nothing but life--the process of discovering,\\r\\nthe everlasting and perpetual process,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, as she passed\\r\\nunder the archway, and so into the wide space of KingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Bench Walk, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnot\\r\\nthe discovery itself at all.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She spoke the last words looking up at\\r\\nRodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s windows, which were a semilucent red color, in her honor, as\\r\\nshe knew. He had asked her to tea with him. But she was in a mood when\\r\\nit is almost physically disagreeable to interrupt the stride of oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nthought, and she walked up and down two or three times under the trees\\r\\nbefore approaching his staircase. She liked getting hold of some book\\r\\nwhich neither her father or mother had read, and keeping it to herself,\\r\\nand gnawing its contents in privacy, and pondering the meaning without\\r\\nsharing her thoughts with any one, or having to decide whether the book\\r\\nwas a good one or a bad one. This evening she had twisted the words of\\r\\nDostoevsky to suit her mood--a fatalistic mood--to proclaim that the\\r\\nprocess of discovery was life, and that, presumably, the nature of oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngoal mattered not at all. She sat down for a moment upon one of the\\r\\nseats; felt herself carried along in the swirl of many things;\\r\\ndecided, in her sudden way, that it was time to heave all this thinking\\r\\noverboard, and rose, leaving a fishmongerÃ¢\\x80\\x99s basket on the seat behind\\r\\nher. Two minutes later her rap sounded with authority upon RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, William,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m late.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was true, but he was so glad to see her that he forgot his annoyance.\\r\\nHe had been occupied for over an hour in making things ready for her,\\r\\nand he now had his reward in seeing her look right and left, as she\\r\\nslipped her cloak from her shoulders, with evident satisfaction,\\r\\nalthough she said nothing. He had seen that the fire burnt well;\\r\\njam-pots were on the table, tin covers shone in the fender, and the\\r\\nshabby comfort of the room was extreme. He was dressed in his old\\r\\ncrimson dressing-gown, which was faded irregularly, and had bright new\\r\\npatches on it, like the paler grass which one finds on lifting a stone.\\r\\nHe made the tea, and Katharine drew off her gloves, and crossed her legs\\r\\nwith a gesture that was rather masculine in its ease. Nor did they talk\\r\\nmuch until they were smoking cigarettes over the fire, having placed\\r\\ntheir teacups upon the floor between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not met since they had exchanged letters about their\\r\\nrelationship. KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s answer to his protestation had been short and\\r\\nsensible. Half a sheet of notepaper contained the whole of it, for she\\r\\nmerely had to say that she was not in love with him, and so could not\\r\\nmarry him, but their friendship would continue, she hoped, unchanged.\\r\\nShe had added a postscript in which she stated, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI like your sonnet very\\r\\nmuch.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far as William was concerned, this appearance of ease was assumed.\\r\\nThree times that afternoon he had dressed himself in a tail-coat, and\\r\\nthree times he had discarded it for an old dressing-gown; three times he\\r\\nhad placed his pearl tie-pin in position, and three times he had removed\\r\\nit again, the little looking-glass in his room being the witness of\\r\\nthese changes of mind. The question was, which would Katharine prefer on\\r\\nthis particular afternoon in December? He read her note once more,\\r\\nand the postscript about the sonnet settled the matter. Evidently she\\r\\nadmired most the poet in him; and as this, on the whole, agreed with his\\r\\nown opinion, he decided to err, if anything, on the side of shabbiness.\\r\\nHis demeanor was also regulated with premeditation; he spoke little, and\\r\\nonly on impersonal matters; he wished her to realize that in visiting\\r\\nhim for the first time alone she was doing nothing remarkable, although,\\r\\nin fact, that was a point about which he was not at all sure.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly Katharine seemed quite unmoved by any disturbing thoughts;\\r\\nand if he had been completely master of himself, he might, indeed,\\r\\nhave complained that she was a trifle absent-minded. The ease, the\\r\\nfamiliarity of the situation alone with Rodney, among teacups and\\r\\ncandles, had more effect upon her than was apparent. She asked to look\\r\\nat his books, and then at his pictures. It was while she held photograph\\r\\nfrom the Greek in her hands that she exclaimed, impulsively, if\\r\\nincongruously:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy oysters! I had a basket,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she explained, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve left it\\r\\nsomewhere. Uncle Dudley dines with us to-night. What in the world have I\\r\\ndone with them?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rose and began to wander about the room. William rose also, and\\r\\nstood in front of the fire, muttering, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOysters, oysters--your basket of\\r\\noysters!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but though he looked vaguely here and there, as if the oysters\\r\\nmight be on the top of the bookshelf, his eyes returned always to\\r\\nKatharine. She drew the curtain and looked out among the scanty leaves\\r\\nof the plane-trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI had them,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she calculated, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cin the Strand; I sat on a seat. Well,\\r\\nnever mind,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she concluded, turning back into the room abruptly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI dare\\r\\nsay some old creature is enjoying them by this time.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should have thought that you never forgot anything,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William\\r\\nremarked, as they settled down again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s part of the myth about me, I know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd I wonder,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William proceeded, with some caution, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat the truth\\r\\nabout you is? But I know this sort of thing doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t interest you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nadded hastily, with a touch of peevishness.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo; it doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t interest me very much,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied candidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat shall we talk about then?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked rather whimsically round the walls of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHowever we start, we end by talking about the same thing--about poetry,\\r\\nI mean. I wonder if you realize, William, that IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve never read even\\r\\nShakespeare? ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s rather wonderful how IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve kept it up all these years.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve kept it up for ten years very beautifully, as far as IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nconcerned,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTen years? So long as that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s always bored you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked into the fire silently. She could not deny that the surface\\r\\nof her feeling was absolutely unruffled by anything in WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncharacter; on the contrary, she felt certain that she could deal with\\r\\nwhatever turned up. He gave her peace, in which she could think of\\r\\nthings that were far removed from what they talked about. Even now,\\r\\nwhen he sat within a yard of her, how easily her mind ranged hither and\\r\\nthither! Suddenly a picture presented itself before her, without any\\r\\neffort on her part as pictures will, of herself in these very rooms; she\\r\\nhad come in from a lecture, and she held a pile of books in her hand,\\r\\nscientific books, and books about mathematics and astronomy which\\r\\nshe had mastered. She put them down on the table over there. It was a\\r\\npicture plucked from her life two or three years hence, when she was\\r\\nmarried to William; but here she checked herself abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not entirely forget WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s presence, because, in spite of\\r\\nhis efforts to control himself, his nervousness was apparent. On such\\r\\noccasions his eyes protruded more than ever, and his face had more than\\r\\never the appearance of being covered with a thin crackling skin, through\\r\\nwhich every flush of his volatile blood showed itself instantly. By this\\r\\ntime he had shaped so many sentences and rejected them, felt so many\\r\\nimpulses and subdued them, that he was a uniform scarlet.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou may say you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t read books,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he remarked, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut, all the same, you\\r\\nknow about them. Besides, who wants you to be learned? Leave that to the\\r\\npoor devils whoÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got nothing better to do. You--you--ahem!--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, then, why donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you read me something before I go?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nKatharine, looking at her watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve only just come! Let me see now, what have I got to\\r\\nshow you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He rose, and stirred about the papers on his table, as if in\\r\\ndoubt; he then picked up a manuscript, and after spreading it smoothly\\r\\nupon his knee, he looked up at Katharine suspiciously. He caught her\\r\\nsmiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI believe you only ask me to read out of kindness,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he burst out.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s find something else to talk about. Who have you been seeing?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t generally ask things out of kindness,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine observed;\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9chowever, if you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to read, you neednÃ¢\\x80\\x99t.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam gave a queer snort of exasperation, and opened his manuscript\\r\\nonce more, though he kept his eyes upon her face as he did so. No face\\r\\ncould have been graver or more judicial.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOne can trust you, certainly, to say unpleasant things,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said,\\r\\nsmoothing out the page, clearing his throat, and reading half a stanza\\r\\nto himself. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAhem! The Princess is lost in the wood, and she hears the\\r\\nsound of a horn. (This would all be very pretty on the stage, but I\\r\\ncanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t get the effect here.) Anyhow, Sylvano enters, accompanied by\\r\\nthe rest of the gentlemen of GratianÃ¢\\x80\\x99s court. I begin where he\\r\\nsoliloquizes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He jerked his head and began to read.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Katharine had just disclaimed any knowledge of literature, she\\r\\nlistened attentively. At least, she listened to the first twenty-five\\r\\nlines attentively, and then she frowned. Her attention was only aroused\\r\\nagain when Rodney raised his finger--a sign, she knew, that the meter\\r\\nwas about to change.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis theory was that every mood has its meter. His mastery of meters was\\r\\nvery great; and, if the beauty of a drama depended upon the variety\\r\\nof measures in which the personages speak, RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s plays must\\r\\nhave challenged the works of Shakespeare. KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s ignorance of\\r\\nShakespeare did not prevent her from feeling fairly certain that plays\\r\\nshould not produce a sense of chill stupor in the audience, such as\\r\\novercame her as the lines flowed on, sometimes long and sometimes short,\\r\\nbut always delivered with the same lilt of voice, which seemed to nail\\r\\neach line firmly on to the same spot in the hearerÃ¢\\x80\\x99s brain. Still, she\\r\\nreflected, these sorts of skill are almost exclusively masculine; women\\r\\nneither practice them nor know how to value them; and oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s husbandÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nproficiency in this direction might legitimately increase oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s respect\\r\\nfor him, since mystification is no bad basis for respect. No one could\\r\\ndoubt that William was a scholar. The reading ended with the finish of\\r\\nthe Act; Katharine had prepared a little speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat seems to me extremely well written, William; although, of course,\\r\\nI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know enough to criticize in detail.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the skill that strikes you--not the emotion?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn a fragment like that, of course, the skill strikes one most.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut perhaps--have you time to listen to one more short piece? the scene\\r\\nbetween the lovers? ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s some real feeling in that, I think. Denham\\r\\nagrees that itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the best thing IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve done.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve read it to Ralph Denham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine inquired, with surprise.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a better judge than I am. What did he say?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney exclaimed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t ask you for criticism,\\r\\nas I should ask a scholar. I dare say there are only five men in England\\r\\nwhose opinion of my work matters a straw to me. But I trust you where\\r\\nfeeling is concerned. I had you in my mind often when I was writing\\r\\nthose scenes. I kept asking myself, Ã¢\\x80\\x98Now is this the sort of thing\\r\\nKatharine would like?Ã¢\\x80\\x99 I always think of you when IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m writing,\\r\\nKatharine, even when itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the sort of thing you wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know about.\\r\\nAnd IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d rather--yes, I really believe IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d rather--you thought well of my\\r\\nwriting than any one in the world.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was so genuine a tribute to his trust in her that Katharine was\\r\\ntouched.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou think too much of me altogether, William,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, forgetting\\r\\nthat she had not meant to speak in this way.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, Katharine, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied, replacing his manuscript in the\\r\\ndrawer. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt does me good to think of you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo quiet an answer, followed as it was by no expression of love, but\\r\\nmerely by the statement that if she must go he would take her to the\\r\\nStrand, and would, if she could wait a moment, change his dressing-gown\\r\\nfor a coat, moved her to the warmest feeling of affection for him that\\r\\nshe had yet experienced. While he changed in the next room, she stood by\\r\\nthe bookcase, taking down books and opening them, but reading nothing on\\r\\ntheir pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe felt certain that she would marry Rodney. How could one avoid it?\\r\\nHow could one find fault with it? Here she sighed, and, putting the\\r\\nthought of marriage away, fell into a dream state, in which she became\\r\\nanother person, and the whole world seemed changed. Being a frequent\\r\\nvisitor to that world, she could find her way there unhesitatingly. If\\r\\nshe had tried to analyze her impressions, she would have said that there\\r\\ndwelt the realities of the appearances which figure in our world; so\\r\\ndirect, powerful, and unimpeded were her sensations there, compared with\\r\\nthose called forth in actual life. There dwelt the things one might have\\r\\nfelt, had there been cause; the perfect happiness of which here we taste\\r\\nthe fragment; the beauty seen here in flying glimpses only. No doubt\\r\\nmuch of the furniture of this world was drawn directly from the\\r\\npast, and even from the England of the Elizabethan age. However the\\r\\nembellishment of this imaginary world might change, two qualities were\\r\\nconstant in it. It was a place where feelings were liberated from the\\r\\nconstraint which the real world puts upon them; and the process of\\r\\nawakenment was always marked by resignation and a kind of stoical\\r\\nacceptance of facts. She met no acquaintance there, as Denham did,\\r\\nmiraculously transfigured; she played no heroic part. But there\\r\\ncertainly she loved some magnanimous hero, and as they swept together\\r\\namong the leaf-hung trees of an unknown world, they shared the feelings\\r\\nwhich came fresh and fast as the waves on the shore. But the sands of\\r\\nher liberation were running fast; even through the forest branches came\\r\\nsounds of Rodney moving things on his dressing-table; and Katharine woke\\r\\nherself from this excursion by shutting the cover of the book she was\\r\\nholding, and replacing it in the bookshelf.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWilliam,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, speaking rather faintly at first, like one sending\\r\\na voice from sleep to reach the living. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWilliam,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she repeated firmly,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cif you still want me to marry you, I will.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps it was that no man could expect to have the most momentous\\r\\nquestion of his life settled in a voice so level, so toneless, so\\r\\ndevoid of joy or energy. At any rate William made no answer. She waited\\r\\nstoically. A moment later he stepped briskly from his dressing-room, and\\r\\nobserved that if she wanted to buy more oysters he thought he knew where\\r\\nthey could find a fishmongerÃ¢\\x80\\x99s shop still open. She breathed deeply a\\r\\nsigh of relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nExtract from a letter sent a few days later by Mrs. Hilbery to her\\r\\nsister-in-law, Mrs. Milvain:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c... How stupid of me to forget the name in my telegram. Such a nice,\\r\\nrich, English name, too, and, in addition, he has all the graces of\\r\\nintellect; he has read literally EVERYTHING. I tell Katharine, I shall\\r\\nalways put him on my right side at dinner, so as to have him by me when\\r\\npeople begin talking about characters in Shakespeare. They wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be\\r\\nrich, but theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be very, very happy. I was sitting in my room late one\\r\\nnight, feeling that nothing nice would ever happen to me again, when I\\r\\nheard Katharine outside in the passage, and I thought to myself, Ã¢\\x80\\x98Shall\\r\\nI call her in?Ã¢\\x80\\x99 and then I thought (in that hopeless, dreary way one\\r\\ndoes think, with the fire going out and oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s birthday just over), Ã¢\\x80\\x98Why\\r\\nshould I lay my troubles on HER?Ã¢\\x80\\x99 But my little self-control had its\\r\\nreward, for next moment she tapped at the door and came in, and sat on\\r\\nthe rug, and though we neither of us said anything, I felt so happy all\\r\\nof a second that I couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t help crying, Ã¢\\x80\\x98Oh, Katharine, when you come\\r\\nto my age, how I hope youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll have a daughter, too!Ã¢\\x80\\x99 You know how silent\\r\\nKatharine is. She was so silent, for such a long time, that in my\\r\\nfoolish, nervous state I dreaded something, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t quite know what.\\r\\nAnd then she told me how, after all, she had made up her mind. She had\\r\\nwritten. She expected him to-morrow. At first I wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t glad at all. I\\r\\ndidnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want her to marry any one; but when she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x98It will make no\\r\\ndifference. I shall always care for you and father most,Ã¢\\x80\\x99 then I saw how\\r\\nselfish I was, and I told her she must give him everything, everything,\\r\\neverything! I told her I should be thankful to come second. But why,\\r\\nwhen everythingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s turned out just as one always hoped it would turn out,\\r\\nwhy then can one do nothing but cry, nothing but feel a desolate old\\r\\nwoman whose lifeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s been a failure, and now is nearly over, and age is so\\r\\ncruel? But Katharine said to me, Ã¢\\x80\\x98I am happy. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m very happy.Ã¢\\x80\\x99 And\\r\\nthen I thought, though it all seemed so desperately dismal at the time,\\r\\nKatharine had said she was happy, and I should have a son, and it would\\r\\nall turn out so much more wonderfully than I could possibly imagine, for\\r\\nthough the sermons donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t say so, I do believe the world is meant for us\\r\\nto be happy in. She told me that they would live quite near us, and see\\r\\nus every day; and she would go on with the Life, and we should finish it\\r\\nas we had meant to. And, after all, it would be far more horrid if\\r\\nshe didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t marry--or suppose she married some one we couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t endure?\\r\\nSuppose she had fallen in love with some one who was married already?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd though one never thinks any one good enough for the people oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nfond of, he has the kindest, truest instincts, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure, and though\\r\\nhe seems nervous and his manner is not commanding, I only think these\\r\\nthings because itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Katharine. And now IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve written this, it comes over\\r\\nme that, of course, all the time, Katharine has what he hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t. She\\r\\ndoes command, she isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t nervous; it comes naturally to her to rule and\\r\\ncontrol. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s time that she should give all this to some one who will\\r\\nneed her when we arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t there, save in our spirits, for whatever people\\r\\nsay, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure I shall come back to this wonderful world where oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbeen so happy and so miserable, where, even now, I seem to see myself\\r\\nstretching out my hands for another present from the great Fairy Tree\\r\\nwhose boughs are still hung with enchanting toys, though they are rarer\\r\\nnow, perhaps, and between the branches one sees no longer the blue sky,\\r\\nbut the stars and the tops of the mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOne doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know any more, does one? One hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t any advice to give\\r\\noneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s children. One can only hope that they will have the same\\r\\nvision and the same power to believe, without which life would be so\\r\\nmeaningless. That is what I ask for Katharine and her husband.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs Mr. Hilbery at home, or Mrs. Hilbery?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham asked, of the\\r\\nparlor-maid in Chelsea, a week later.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. But Miss Hilbery is at home,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the girl answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph had anticipated many answers, but not this one, and now it\\r\\nwas unexpectedly made plain to him that it was the chance of seeing\\r\\nKatharine that had brought him all the way to Chelsea on pretence of\\r\\nseeing her father.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made some show of considering the matter, and was taken upstairs to\\r\\nthe drawing-room. As upon that first occasion, some weeks ago, the door\\r\\nclosed as if it were a thousand doors softly excluding the world; and\\r\\nonce more Ralph received an impression of a room full of deep shadows,\\r\\nfirelight, unwavering silver candle flames, and empty spaces to be\\r\\ncrossed before reaching the round table in the middle of the room,\\r\\nwith its frail burden of silver trays and china teacups. But this time\\r\\nKatharine was there by herself; the volume in her hand showed that she\\r\\nexpected no visitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph said something about hoping to find her father.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy father is out,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut if you can wait, I expect him\\r\\nsoon.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt might have been due merely to politeness, but Ralph felt that she\\r\\nreceived him almost with cordiality. Perhaps she was bored by drinking\\r\\ntea and reading a book all alone; at any rate, she tossed the book on to\\r\\na sofa with a gesture of relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs that one of the moderns whom you despise?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked, smiling at the\\r\\ncarelessness of her gesture.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think even you would despise him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEven I?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy even I?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou said you liked modern things; I said I hated them.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was not a very accurate report of their conversation among the\\r\\nrelics, perhaps, but Ralph was flattered to think that she remembered\\r\\nanything about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOr did I confess that I hated all books?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went on, seeing him look\\r\\nup with an air of inquiry. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI forget--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you hate all books?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt would be absurd to say that I hate all books when IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve only read\\r\\nten, perhaps; but--Ã¢\\x80\\x99 Here she pulled herself up short.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I do hate books,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy do you want to be for ever\\r\\ntalking about your feelings? ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t make out. And poetryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nall about feelings--novels are all about feelings.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe cut a cake vigorously into slices, and providing a tray with bread\\r\\nand butter for Mrs. Hilbery, who was in her room with a cold, she rose\\r\\nto go upstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph held the door open for her, and then stood with clasped hands in\\r\\nthe middle of the room. His eyes were bright, and, indeed, he scarcely\\r\\nknew whether they beheld dreams or realities. All down the street and\\r\\non the doorstep, and while he mounted the stairs, his dream of Katharine\\r\\npossessed him; on the threshold of the room he had dismissed it, in\\r\\norder to prevent too painful a collision between what he dreamt of her\\r\\nand what she was. And in five minutes she had filled the shell of the\\r\\nold dream with the flesh of life; looked with fire out of phantom eyes.\\r\\nHe glanced about him with bewilderment at finding himself among her\\r\\nchairs and tables; they were solid, for he grasped the back of the chair\\r\\nin which Katharine had sat; and yet they were unreal; the atmosphere was\\r\\nthat of a dream. He summoned all the faculties of his spirit to seize\\r\\nwhat the minutes had to give him; and from the depths of his mind there\\r\\nrose unchecked a joyful recognition of the truth that human nature\\r\\nsurpasses, in its beauty, all that our wildest dreams bring us hints of.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine came into the room a moment later. He stood watching her come\\r\\ntowards him, and thought her more beautiful and strange than his dream\\r\\nof her; for the real Katharine could speak the words which seemed\\r\\nto crowd behind the forehead and in the depths of the eyes, and the\\r\\ncommonest sentence would be flashed on by this immortal light. And she\\r\\noverflowed the edges of the dream; he remarked that her softness was\\r\\nlike that of some vast snowy owl; she wore a ruby on her finger.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy mother wants me to tell you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat she hopes you have\\r\\nbegun your poem. She says every one ought to write poetry.... All my\\r\\nrelations write poetry,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went on. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t bear to think of it\\r\\nsometimes--because, of course, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s none of it any good. But then one\\r\\nneednÃ¢\\x80\\x99t read it--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t encourage me to write a poem,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not a poet, too, are you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she inquired, turning upon him\\r\\nwith a laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShould I tell you if I were?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. Because I think you speak the truth,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, searching him for\\r\\nproof of this apparently, with eyes now almost impersonally direct. It\\r\\nwould be easy, Ralph thought, to worship one so far removed, and yet of\\r\\nso straight a nature; easy to submit recklessly to her, without thought\\r\\nof future pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you a poet?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she demanded. He felt that her question had an\\r\\nunexplained weight of meaning behind it, as if she sought an answer to a\\r\\nquestion that she did not ask.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. I havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t written any poetry for years,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut all the\\r\\nsame, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t agree with you. I think itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the only thing worth doing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy do you say that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked, almost with impatience, tapping her\\r\\nspoon two or three times against the side of her cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph laid hands on the first words that came to mind. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBecause,\\r\\nI suppose, it keeps an ideal alive which might die otherwise.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA curious change came over her face, as if the flame of her mind were\\r\\nsubdued; and she looked at him ironically and with the expression which\\r\\nhe had called sad before, for want of a better name for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know that thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s much sense in having ideals,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut you have them,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied energetically. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy do we call them\\r\\nideals? ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a stupid word. Dreams, I mean--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe followed his words with parted lips, as though to answer eagerly\\r\\nwhen he had done; but as he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDreams, I mean,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the door of the\\r\\ndrawing-room swung open, and so remained for a perceptible instant. They\\r\\nboth held themselves silent, her lips still parted.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar off, they heard the rustle of skirts. Then the owner of the skirts\\r\\nappeared in the doorway, which she almost filled, nearly concealing the\\r\\nfigure of a very much smaller lady who accompanied her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy aunts!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine murmured, under her breath. Her tone had a hint of\\r\\ntragedy in it, but no less, Ralph thought, than the situation required.\\r\\nShe addressed the larger lady as Aunt Millicent; the smaller was Aunt\\r\\nCelia, Mrs. Milvain, who had lately undertaken the task of marrying\\r\\nCyril to his wife. Both ladies, but Mrs. Cosham (Aunt Millicent)\\r\\nin particular, had that look of heightened, smoothed, incarnadined\\r\\nexistence which is proper to elderly ladies paying calls in London about\\r\\nfive oÃ¢\\x80\\x99clock in the afternoon. Portraits by Romney, seen through glass,\\r\\nhave something of their pink, mellow look, their blooming softness, as\\r\\nof apricots hanging upon a red wall in the afternoon sun. Mrs. Cosham\\r\\nwas so appareled with hanging muffs, chains, and swinging draperies that\\r\\nit was impossible to detect the shape of a human being in the mass of\\r\\nbrown and black which filled the arm-chair. Mrs. Milvain was a much\\r\\nslighter figure; but the same doubt as to the precise lines of her\\r\\ncontour filled Ralph, as he regarded them, with dismal foreboding.\\r\\nWhat remark of his would ever reach these fabulous and fantastic\\r\\ncharacters?--for there was something fantastically unreal in the curious\\r\\nswayings and noddings of Mrs. Cosham, as if her equipment included a\\r\\nlarge wire spring. Her voice had a high-pitched, cooing note, which\\r\\nprolonged words and cut them short until the English language seemed\\r\\nno longer fit for common purposes. In a moment of nervousness, so Ralph\\r\\nthought, Katharine had turned on innumerable electric lights. But Mrs.\\r\\nCosham had gained impetus (perhaps her swaying movements had that end in\\r\\nview) for sustained speech; and she now addressed Ralph deliberately and\\r\\nelaborately.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI come from Woking, Mr. Popham. You may well ask me, why Woking? and to\\r\\nthat I answer, for perhaps the hundredth time, because of the sunsets.\\r\\nWe went there for the sunsets, but that was five-and-twenty years ago.\\r\\nWhere are the sunsets now? Alas! There is no sunset now nearer than the\\r\\nSouth Coast.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Her rich and romantic notes were accompanied by a wave\\r\\nof a long white hand, which, when waved, gave off a flash of diamonds,\\r\\nrubies, and emeralds. Ralph wondered whether she more resembled an\\r\\nelephant, with a jeweled head-dress, or a superb cockatoo, balanced\\r\\ninsecurely upon its perch, and pecking capriciously at a lump of sugar.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhere are the sunsets now?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she repeated. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo you find sunsets now, Mr.\\r\\nPopham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI live at Highgate,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt Highgate? Yes, Highgate has its charms; your Uncle John lived at\\r\\nHighgate,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she jerked in the direction of Katharine. She sank her head\\r\\nupon her breast, as if for a momentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s meditation, which past, she looked\\r\\nup and observed: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI dare say there are very pretty lanes in Highgate.\\r\\nI can recollect walking with your mother, Katharine, through lanes\\r\\nblossoming with wild hawthorn. But where is the hawthorn now? You\\r\\nremember that exquisite description in De Quincey, Mr. Popham?--but\\r\\nI forget, you, in your generation, with all your activity and\\r\\nenlightenment, at which I can only marvelÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--here she displayed both her\\r\\nbeautiful white hands--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdo not read De Quincey. You have your Belloc,\\r\\nyour Chesterton, your Bernard Shaw--why should you read De Quincey?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut I do read De Quincey,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph protested, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmore than Belloc and\\r\\nChesterton, anyhow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIndeed!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Cosham, with a gesture of surprise and\\r\\nrelief mingled. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou are, then, a Ã¢\\x80\\x98rara avisÃ¢\\x80\\x99 in your generation. I am\\r\\ndelighted to meet anyone who reads De Quincey.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere she hollowed her hand into a screen, and, leaning towards\\r\\nKatharine, inquired, in a very audible whisper, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDoes your friend\\r\\nWRITE?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Denham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, with more than her usual clearness and\\r\\nfirmness, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwrites for the Review. He is a lawyer.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe clean-shaven lips, showing the expression of the mouth! I recognize\\r\\nthem at once. I always feel at home with lawyers, Mr. Denham--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey used to come about so much in the old days,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Milvain\\r\\ninterposed, the frail, silvery notes of her voice falling with the sweet\\r\\ntone of an old bell.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou say you live at Highgate,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wonder whether you\\r\\nhappen to know if there is an old house called Tempest Lodge still in\\r\\nexistence--an old white house in a garden?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph shook his head, and she sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, no; it must have been pulled down by this time, with all the other\\r\\nold houses. There were such pretty lanes in those days. That was how\\r\\nyour uncle met your Aunt Emily, you know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she addressed Katharine.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey walked home through the lanes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA sprig of May in her bonnet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Cosham ejaculated, reminiscently.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd next Sunday he had violets in his buttonhole. And that was how we\\r\\nguessed.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine laughed. She looked at Ralph. His eyes were meditative, and\\r\\nshe wondered what he found in this old gossip to make him ponder so\\r\\ncontentedly. She felt, she hardly knew why, a curious pity for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUncle John--yes, Ã¢\\x80\\x98poor John,Ã¢\\x80\\x99 you always called him. Why was that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she asked, to make them go on talking, which, indeed, they needed little\\r\\ninvitation to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat was what his father, old Sir Richard, always called him. Poor\\r\\nJohn, or the fool of the family,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Milvain hastened to inform\\r\\nthem. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe other boys were so brilliant, and he could never pass his\\r\\nexaminations, so they sent him to India--a long voyage in those days,\\r\\npoor fellow. You had your own room, you know, and you did it up. But he\\r\\nwill get his knighthood and a pension, I believe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, turning to\\r\\nRalph, Ã¢\\x80\\x9conly it is not England.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Cosham confirmed her, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit is not England. In those days we\\r\\nthought an Indian Judgeship about equal to a county-court judgeship at\\r\\nhome. His Honor--a pretty title, but still, not at the top of the tree.\\r\\nHowever,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she sighed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif you have a wife and seven children, and people\\r\\nnowadays very quickly forget your fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s name--well, you have to take\\r\\nwhat you can get,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she concluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd I fancy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Milvain resumed, lowering her voice rather\\r\\nconfidentially, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat John would have done more if it hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t been for\\r\\nhis wife, your Aunt Emily. She was a very good woman, devoted to him, of\\r\\ncourse, but she was not ambitious for him, and if a wife isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t ambitious\\r\\nfor her husband, especially in a profession like the law, clients soon\\r\\nget to know of it. In our young days, Mr. Denham, we used to say that we\\r\\nknew which of our friends would become judges, by looking at the girls\\r\\nthey married. And so it was, and so, I fancy, it always will be. I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nthink,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, summing up these scattered remarks, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat any man is\\r\\nreally happy unless he succeeds in his profession.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Cosham approved of this sentiment with more ponderous sagacity from\\r\\nher side of the tea-table, in the first place by swaying her head, and\\r\\nin the second by remarking:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, men are not the same as women. I fancy Alfred Tennyson spoke the\\r\\ntruth about that as about many other things. How I wish heÃ¢\\x80\\x99d lived to\\r\\nwrite Ã¢\\x80\\x98The PrinceÃ¢\\x80\\x99--a sequel to Ã¢\\x80\\x98The PrincessÃ¢\\x80\\x99! I confess IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m almost\\r\\ntired of Princesses. We want some one to show us what a good man can be.\\r\\nWe have Laura and Beatrice, Antigone and Cordelia, but we have no heroic\\r\\nman. How do you, as a poet, account for that, Mr. Denham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not a poet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph good-humoredly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m only a solicitor.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut you write, too?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Cosham demanded, afraid lest she should\\r\\nbe balked of her priceless discovery, a young man truly devoted to\\r\\nliterature.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn my spare time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham reassured her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn your spare time!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Cosham echoed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThat is a proof of devotion,\\r\\nindeed.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She half closed her eyes, and indulged herself in a fascinating\\r\\npicture of a briefless barrister lodged in a garret, writing immortal\\r\\nnovels by the light of a farthing dip. But the romance which fell upon\\r\\nthe figures of great writers and illumined their pages was no false\\r\\nradiance in her case. She carried her pocket Shakespeare about with\\r\\nher, and met life fortified by the words of the poets. How far she saw\\r\\nDenham, and how far she confused him with some hero of fiction, it would\\r\\nbe hard to say. Literature had taken possession even of her memories.\\r\\nShe was matching him, presumably, with certain characters in the old\\r\\nnovels, for she came out, after a pause, with:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUm--um--Pendennis--Warrington--I could never forgive Laura,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\npronounced energetically, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor not marrying George, in spite of\\r\\neverything. George Eliot did the very same thing; and Lewes was a little\\r\\nfrog-faced man, with the manner of a dancing master. But Warrington,\\r\\nnow, had everything in his favor; intellect, passion, romance,\\r\\ndistinction, and the connection was a mere piece of undergraduate folly.\\r\\nArthur, I confess, has always seemed to me a bit of a fop; I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nimagine how Laura married him. But you say youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re a solicitor, Mr.\\r\\nDenham. Now there are one or two things I should like to ask you--about\\r\\nShakespeare--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She drew out her small, worn volume with some difficulty,\\r\\nopened it, and shook it in the air. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThey say, nowadays, that\\r\\nShakespeare was a lawyer. They say, that accounts for his knowledge of\\r\\nhuman nature. ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a fine example for you, Mr. Denham. Study your\\r\\nclients, young man, and the world will be the richer one of these days,\\r\\nI have no doubt. Tell me, how do we come out of it, now; better or worse\\r\\nthan you expected?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThus called upon to sum up the worth of human nature in a few words,\\r\\nRalph answered unhesitatingly:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWorse, Mrs. Cosham, a good deal worse. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid the ordinary man is a\\r\\nbit of a rascal--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd the ordinary woman?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like the ordinary woman either--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, dear me, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve no doubt thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s very true, very true.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Cosham\\r\\nsighed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSwift would have agreed with you, anyhow--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She looked at him,\\r\\nand thought that there were signs of distinct power in his brow. He\\r\\nwould do well, she thought, to devote himself to satire.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCharles Lavington, you remember, was a solicitor,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Milvain\\r\\ninterposed, rather resenting the waste of time involved in talking about\\r\\nfictitious people when you might be talking about real people. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut you\\r\\nwouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t remember him, Katharine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Lavington? Oh, yes, I do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, waking from other\\r\\nthoughts with her little start. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe summer we had a house near Tenby. I\\r\\nremember the field and the pond with the tadpoles, and making haystacks\\r\\nwith Mr. Lavington.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe is right. There WAS a pond with tadpoles,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Cosham\\r\\ncorroborated. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMillais made studies of it for Ã¢\\x80\\x98Ophelia.Ã¢\\x80\\x99 Some say that\\r\\nis the best picture he ever painted--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd I remember the dog chained up in the yard, and the dead snakes\\r\\nhanging in the toolhouse.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt was at Tenby that you were chased by the bull,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Milvain\\r\\ncontinued. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut that you couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t remember, though itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s true you were\\r\\na wonderful child. Such eyes she had, Mr. Denham! I used to say to her\\r\\nfather, Ã¢\\x80\\x98SheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s watching us, and summing us all up in her little mind.Ã¢\\x80\\x99\\r\\nAnd they had a nurse in those days,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went on, telling her story with\\r\\ncharming solemnity to Ralph, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwho was a good woman, but engaged to a\\r\\nsailor. When she ought to have been attending to the baby, her eyes were\\r\\non the sea. And Mrs. Hilbery allowed this girl--Susan her name was--to\\r\\nhave him to stay in the village. They abused her goodness, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sorry\\r\\nto say, and while they walked in the lanes, they stood the perambulator\\r\\nalone in a field where there was a bull. The animal became enraged by\\r\\nthe red blanket in the perambulator, and Heaven knows what might have\\r\\nhappened if a gentleman had not been walking by in the nick of time, and\\r\\nrescued Katharine in his arms!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think the bull was only a cow, Aunt Celia,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy darling, it was a great red Devonshire bull, and not long after it\\r\\ngored a man to death and had to be destroyed. And your mother forgave\\r\\nSusan--a thing I could never have done.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMaggieÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sympathies were entirely with Susan and the sailor, I\\r\\nam sure,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Cosham, rather tartly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMy sister-in-law,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\ncontinued, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chas laid her burdens upon Providence at every crisis in her\\r\\nlife, and Providence, I must confess, has responded nobly, so far--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, with a laugh, for she liked the rashness which\\r\\nirritated the rest of the family. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMy motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s bulls always turn into\\r\\ncows at the critical moment.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Milvain, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m glad you have some one to protect you\\r\\nfrom bulls now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t imagine William protecting any one from bulls,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that Mrs. Cosham had once more produced her pocket volume\\r\\nof Shakespeare, and was consulting Ralph upon an obscure passage in\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMeasure for Measure.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He did not at once seize the meaning of what\\r\\nKatharine and her aunt were saying; William, he supposed, referred to\\r\\nsome small cousin, for he now saw Katharine as a child in a pinafore;\\r\\nbut, nevertheless, he was so much distracted that his eye could hardly\\r\\nfollow the words on the paper. A moment later he heard them speak\\r\\ndistinctly of an engagement ring.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI like rubies,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he heard Katharine say.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTo be imprisonÃ¢\\x80\\x99d in the viewless winds,\\r\\n    And blown with restless violence round about\\r\\n    The pendant world....Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Cosham intoned; at the same instant Ã¢\\x80\\x9cRodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x9d fitted itself to\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x9d in RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mind. He felt convinced that Katharine was engaged\\r\\nto Rodney. His first sensation was one of violent rage with her for\\r\\nhaving deceived him throughout the visit, fed him with pleasant old\\r\\nwivesÃ¢\\x80\\x99 tales, let him see her as a child playing in a meadow, shared\\r\\nher youth with him, while all the time she was a stranger entirely, and\\r\\nengaged to marry Rodney.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut was it possible? Surely it was not possible. For in his eyes she was\\r\\nstill a child. He paused so long over the book that Mrs. Cosham had time\\r\\nto look over his shoulder and ask her niece:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd have you settled upon a house yet, Katharine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis convinced him of the truth of the monstrous idea. He looked up at\\r\\nonce and said:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a difficult passage.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis voice had changed so much, he spoke with such curtness and even with\\r\\nsuch contempt, that Mrs. Cosham looked at him fairly puzzled. Happily\\r\\nshe belonged to a generation which expected uncouthness in its men, and\\r\\nshe merely felt convinced that this Mr. Denham was very, very clever.\\r\\nShe took back her Shakespeare, as Denham seemed to have no more to say,\\r\\nand secreted it once more about her person with the infinitely pathetic\\r\\nresignation of the old.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s engaged to William Rodney,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, by way of filling in\\r\\nthe pause; Ã¢\\x80\\x9ca very old friend of ours. He has a wonderful knowledge of\\r\\nliterature, too--wonderful.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She nodded her head rather vaguely. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\nshould meet each other.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s one wish was to leave the house as soon as he could; but the\\r\\nelderly ladies had risen, and were proposing to visit Mrs. Hilbery in\\r\\nher bedroom, so that any move on his part was impossible. At the same\\r\\ntime, he wished to say something, but he knew not what, to Katharine\\r\\nalone. She took her aunts upstairs, and returned, coming towards him\\r\\nonce more with an air of innocence and friendliness that amazed him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy father will be back,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you sit down?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and she\\r\\nlaughed, as if now they might share a perfectly friendly laugh at the\\r\\ntea-party.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Ralph made no attempt to seat himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI must congratulate you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt was news to me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He saw her face\\r\\nchange, but only to become graver than before.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy engagement?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I am going to marry William Rodney.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph remained standing with his hand on the back of a chair in absolute\\r\\nsilence. Abysses seemed to plunge into darkness between them. He looked\\r\\nat her, but her face showed that she was not thinking of him. No regret\\r\\nor consciousness of wrong disturbed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, I must go,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said at length.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe seemed about to say something, then changed her mind and said\\r\\nmerely:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou will come again, I hope. We always seemÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--she hesitated--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto be\\r\\ninterrupted.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bowed and left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph strode with extreme swiftness along the Embankment. Every muscle\\r\\nwas taut and braced as if to resist some sudden attack from outside. For\\r\\nthe moment it seemed as if the attack were about to be directed\\r\\nagainst his body, and his brain thus was on the alert, but without\\r\\nunderstanding. Finding himself, after a few minutes, no longer under\\r\\nobservation, and no attack delivered, he slackened his pace, the pain\\r\\nspread all through him, took possession of every governing seat, and met\\r\\nwith scarcely any resistance from powers exhausted by their first effort\\r\\nat defence. He took his way languidly along the river embankment, away\\r\\nfrom home rather than towards it. The world had him at its mercy. He\\r\\nmade no pattern out of the sights he saw. He felt himself now, as he had\\r\\noften fancied other people, adrift on the stream, and far removed from\\r\\ncontrol of it, a man with no grasp upon circumstances any longer. Old\\r\\nbattered men loafing at the doors of public-houses now seemed to be his\\r\\nfellows, and he felt, as he supposed them to feel, a mingling of envy\\r\\nand hatred towards those who passed quickly and certainly to a goal of\\r\\ntheir own. They, too, saw things very thin and shadowy, and were wafted\\r\\nabout by the lightest breath of wind. For the substantial world, with\\r\\nits prospect of avenues leading on and on to the invisible distance,\\r\\nhad slipped from him, since Katharine was engaged. Now all his life\\r\\nwas visible, and the straight, meager path had its ending soon enough.\\r\\nKatharine was engaged, and she had deceived him, too. He felt for\\r\\ncorners of his being untouched by his disaster; but there was no\\r\\nlimit to the flood of damage; not one of his possessions was safe now.\\r\\nKatharine had deceived him; she had mixed herself with every thought of\\r\\nhis, and reft of her they seemed false thoughts which he would blush to\\r\\nthink again. His life seemed immeasurably impoverished.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat himself down, in spite of the chilly fog which obscured the\\r\\nfarther bank and left its lights suspended upon a blank surface, upon\\r\\none of the riverside seats, and let the tide of disillusionment sweep\\r\\nthrough him. For the time being all bright points in his life were\\r\\nblotted out; all prominences leveled. At first he made himself believe\\r\\nthat Katharine had treated him badly, and drew comfort from the thought\\r\\nthat, left alone, she would recollect this, and think of him and tender\\r\\nhim, in silence, at any rate, an apology. But this grain of comfort\\r\\nfailed him after a second or two, for, upon reflection, he had to admit\\r\\nthat Katharine owed him nothing. Katharine had promised nothing, taken\\r\\nnothing; to her his dreams had meant nothing. This, indeed, was the\\r\\nlowest pitch of his despair. If the best of oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s feelings means nothing\\r\\nto the person most concerned in those feelings, what reality is left\\r\\nus? The old romance which had warmed his days for him, the thoughts of\\r\\nKatharine which had painted every hour, were now made to appear foolish\\r\\nand enfeebled. He rose, and looked into the river, whose swift race of\\r\\ndun-colored waters seemed the very spirit of futility and oblivion.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn what can one trust, then?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he thought, as he leant there. So feeble\\r\\nand insubstantial did he feel himself that he repeated the word aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn what can one trust? Not in men and women. Not in oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s dreams about\\r\\nthem. ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s nothing--nothing, nothing left at all.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Denham had reason to know that he could bring to birth and keep\\r\\nalive a fine anger when he chose. Rodney provided a good target for\\r\\nthat emotion. And yet at the moment, Rodney and Katharine herself seemed\\r\\ndisembodied ghosts. He could scarcely remember the look of them. His\\r\\nmind plunged lower and lower. Their marriage seemed of no importance to\\r\\nhim. All things had turned to ghosts; the whole mass of the world was\\r\\ninsubstantial vapor, surrounding the solitary spark in his mind, whose\\r\\nburning point he could remember, for it burnt no more. He had once\\r\\ncherished a belief, and Katharine had embodied this belief, and she did\\r\\nso no longer. He did not blame her; he blamed nothing, nobody; he saw\\r\\nthe truth. He saw the dun-colored race of waters and the blank shore.\\r\\nBut life is vigorous; the body lives, and the body, no doubt, dictated\\r\\nthe reflection, which now urged him to movement, that one may cast\\r\\naway the forms of human beings, and yet retain the passion which seemed\\r\\ninseparable from their existence in the flesh. Now this passion burnt on\\r\\nhis horizon, as the winter sun makes a greenish pane in the west through\\r\\nthinning clouds. His eyes were set on something infinitely far and\\r\\nremote; by that light he felt he could walk, and would, in future, have\\r\\nto find his way. But that was all there was left to him of a populous\\r\\nand teeming world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lunch hour in the office was only partly spent by Denham in the\\r\\nconsumption of food. Whether fine or wet, he passed most of it pacing\\r\\nthe gravel paths in LincolnÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Inn Fields. The children got to know\\r\\nhis figure, and the sparrows expected their daily scattering of\\r\\nbread-crumbs. No doubt, since he often gave a copper and almost always a\\r\\nhandful of bread, he was not as blind to his surroundings as he thought\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe thought that these winter days were spent in long hours before\\r\\nwhite papers radiant in electric light; and in short passages through\\r\\nfog-dimmed streets. When he came back to his work after lunch he carried\\r\\nin his head a picture of the Strand, scattered with omnibuses, and of\\r\\nthe purple shapes of leaves pressed flat upon the gravel, as if his eyes\\r\\nhad always been bent upon the ground. His brain worked incessantly, but\\r\\nhis thought was attended with so little joy that he did not willingly\\r\\nrecall it; but drove ahead, now in this direction, now in that; and came\\r\\nhome laden with dark books borrowed from a library.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary Datchet, coming from the Strand at lunch-time, saw him one day\\r\\ntaking his turn, closely buttoned in an overcoat, and so lost in thought\\r\\nthat he might have been sitting in his own room.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was overcome by something very like awe by the sight of him; then\\r\\nshe felt much inclined to laugh, although her pulse beat faster. She\\r\\npassed him, and he never saw her. She came back and touched him on the\\r\\nshoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGracious, Mary!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow you startled me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. You looked as if you were walking in your sleep,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAre\\r\\nyou arranging some terrible love affair? Have you got to reconcile a\\r\\ndesperate couple?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t thinking about my work,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph replied, rather hastily. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd,\\r\\nbesides, that sort of thingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not in my line,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, rather grimly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning was fine, and they had still some minutes of leisure to\\r\\nspend. They had not met for two or three weeks, and Mary had much to\\r\\nsay to Ralph; but she was not certain how far he wished for her company.\\r\\nHowever, after a turn or two, in which a few facts were communicated, he\\r\\nsuggested sitting down, and she took the seat beside him. The sparrows\\r\\ncame fluttering about them, and Ralph produced from his pocket the half\\r\\nof a roll saved from his luncheon. He threw a few crumbs among them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve never seen sparrows so tame,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary observed, by way of saying\\r\\nsomething.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe sparrows in Hyde Park arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t as tame as this. If\\r\\nwe keep perfectly still, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll get one to settle on my arm.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary felt that she could have forgone this display of animal good\\r\\ntemper, but seeing that Ralph, for some curious reason, took a pride in\\r\\nthe sparrows, she bet him sixpence that he would not succeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDone!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said; and his eye, which had been gloomy, showed a spark\\r\\nof light. His conversation was now addressed entirely to a bald\\r\\ncock-sparrow, who seemed bolder than the rest; and Mary took the\\r\\nopportunity of looking at him. She was not satisfied; his face was worn,\\r\\nand his expression stern. A child came bowling its hoop through the\\r\\nconcourse of birds, and Ralph threw his last crumbs of bread into the\\r\\nbushes with a snort of impatience.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what always happens--just as IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve almost got him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s your sixpence, Mary. But youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve only got it thanks to that brute\\r\\nof a boy. They oughtnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t to be allowed to bowl hoops here--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOughtnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t to be allowed to bowl hoops! My dear Ralph, what nonsense!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou always say that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he complained; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand it isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t nonsense. WhatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the\\r\\npoint of having a garden if one canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t watch birds in it? The street does\\r\\nall right for hoops. And if children canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be trusted in the streets,\\r\\ntheir mothers should keep them at home.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary made no answer to this remark, but frowned.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe leant back on the seat and looked about her at the great houses\\r\\nbreaking the soft gray-blue sky with their chimneys.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, well,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLondonÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a fine place to live in. I believe I\\r\\ncould sit and watch people all day long. I like my fellow-creatures....Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph sighed impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I think so, when you come to know them,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, as if his\\r\\ndisagreement had been spoken.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s just when I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like them,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cStill, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see\\r\\nwhy you shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t cherish that illusion, if it pleases you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He spoke\\r\\nwithout much vehemence of agreement or disagreement. He seemed chilled.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWake up, Ralph! YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re half asleep!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary cried, turning and pinching\\r\\nhis sleeve. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat have you been doing with yourself? Moping? Working?\\r\\nDespising the world, as usual?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he merely shook his head, and filled his pipe, she went on:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a bit of a pose, isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot more than most things,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary remarked, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve a great deal to say to you, but I must go\\r\\non--we have a committee.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She rose, but hesitated, looking down upon\\r\\nhim rather gravely. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t look happy, Ralph,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIs it\\r\\nanything, or is it nothing?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not immediately answer her, but rose, too, and walked with her\\r\\ntowards the gate. As usual, he did not speak to her without considering\\r\\nwhether what he was about to say was the sort of thing that he could say\\r\\nto her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been bothered,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said at length. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPartly by work, and partly by\\r\\nfamily troubles. Charles has been behaving like a fool. He wants to go\\r\\nout to Canada as a farmer--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s something to be said for that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary; and they\\r\\npassed the gate, and walked slowly round the Fields again, discussing\\r\\ndifficulties which, as a matter of fact, were more or less chronic\\r\\nin the Denham family, and only now brought forward to appease MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsympathy, which, however, soothed Ralph more than he was aware of. She\\r\\nmade him at least dwell upon problems which were real in the sense that\\r\\nthey were capable of solution; and the true cause of his melancholy,\\r\\nwhich was not susceptible to such treatment, sank rather more deeply\\r\\ninto the shades of his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was attentive; she was helpful. Ralph could not help feeling\\r\\ngrateful to her, the more so, perhaps, because he had not told her the\\r\\ntruth about his state; and when they reached the gate again he wished to\\r\\nmake some affectionate objection to her leaving him. But his affection\\r\\ntook the rather uncouth form of expostulating with her about her work.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat dÃ¢\\x80\\x99you want to sit on a committee for?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s waste of\\r\\nyour time, Mary.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI agree with you that a country walk would benefit the world more,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLook here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added suddenly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhy donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you come to us at\\r\\nChristmas? ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s almost the best time of year.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCome to you at Disham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. We wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t interfere with you. But you can tell me later,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said,\\r\\nrather hastily, and then started off in the direction of Russell Square.\\r\\nShe had invited him on the impulse of the moment, as a vision of the\\r\\ncountry came before her; and now she was annoyed with herself for having\\r\\ndone so, and then she was annoyed at being annoyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t face a walk in a field alone with Ralph,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she reasoned, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nbetter buy a cat and live in a lodging at Ealing, like Sally Seal--and\\r\\nhe wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t come. Or did he mean that he WOULD come?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head. She really did not know what he had meant. She never\\r\\nfelt quite certain; but now she was more than usually baffled. Was\\r\\nhe concealing something from her? His manner had been odd; his deep\\r\\nabsorption had impressed her; there was something in him that she had\\r\\nnot fathomed, and the mystery of his nature laid more of a spell upon\\r\\nher than she liked. Moreover, she could not prevent herself from doing\\r\\nnow what she had often blamed others of her sex for doing--from endowing\\r\\nher friend with a kind of heavenly fire, and passing her life before it\\r\\nfor his sanction.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder this process, the committee rather dwindled in importance;\\r\\nthe Suffrage shrank; she vowed she would work harder at the Italian\\r\\nlanguage; she thought she would take up the study of birds. But this\\r\\nprogram for a perfect life threatened to become so absurd that she very\\r\\nsoon caught herself out in the evil habit, and was rehearsing her speech\\r\\nto the committee by the time the chestnut-colored bricks of Russell\\r\\nSquare came in sight. Indeed, she never noticed them. She ran upstairs\\r\\nas usual, and was completely awakened to reality by the sight of Mrs.\\r\\nSeal, on the landing outside the office, inducing a very large dog to\\r\\ndrink water out of a tumbler.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss Markham has already arrived,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Seal remarked, with due\\r\\nsolemnity, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand this is her dog.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA very fine dog, too,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, patting him on the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. A magnificent fellow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Seal agreed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA kind of St. Bernard,\\r\\nshe tells me--so like Kit to have a St. Bernard. And you guard your\\r\\nmistress well, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you, Sailor? You see that wicked men donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t break\\r\\ninto her larder when sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s out at HER work--helping poor souls who have\\r\\nlost their way.... But weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re late--we must begin!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and scattering the\\r\\nrest of the water indiscriminately over the floor, she hurried Mary into\\r\\nthe committee-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Clacton was in his glory. The machinery which he had perfected and\\r\\ncontrolled was now about to turn out its bi-monthly product, a committee\\r\\nmeeting; and his pride in the perfect structure of these assemblies was\\r\\ngreat. He loved the jargon of committee-rooms; he loved the way in which\\r\\nthe door kept opening as the clock struck the hour, in obedience to\\r\\na few strokes of his pen on a piece of paper; and when it had opened\\r\\nsufficiently often, he loved to issue from his inner chamber with\\r\\ndocuments in his hands, visibly important, with a preoccupied expression\\r\\non his face that might have suited a Prime Minister advancing to meet\\r\\nhis Cabinet. By his orders the table had been decorated beforehand with\\r\\nsix sheets of blotting-paper, with six pens, six ink-pots, a tumbler\\r\\nand a jug of water, a bell, and, in deference to the taste of the lady\\r\\nmembers, a vase of hardy chrysanthemums. He had already surreptitiously\\r\\nstraightened the sheets of blotting-paper in relation to the ink-pots,\\r\\nand now stood in front of the fire engaged in conversation with Miss\\r\\nMarkham. But his eye was on the door, and when Mary and Mrs. Seal\\r\\nentered, he gave a little laugh and observed to the assembly which was\\r\\nscattered about the room:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI fancy, ladies and gentlemen, that we are ready to commence.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo speaking, he took his seat at the head of the table, and arranging\\r\\none bundle of papers upon his right and another upon his left, called\\r\\nupon Miss Datchet to read the minutes of the previous meeting. Mary\\r\\nobeyed. A keen observer might have wondered why it was necessary for the\\r\\nsecretary to knit her brows so closely over the tolerably matter-of-fact\\r\\nstatement before her. Could there be any doubt in her mind that it had\\r\\nbeen resolved to circularize the provinces with Leaflet No. 3, or to\\r\\nissue a statistical diagram showing the proportion of married women\\r\\nto spinsters in New Zealand; or that the net profits of Mrs. HipsleyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nBazaar had reached a total of five pounds eight shillings and twopence\\r\\nhalf-penny?\\r\\n\\r\\nCould any doubt as to the perfect sense and propriety of these\\r\\nstatements be disturbing her? No one could have guessed, from the look\\r\\nof her, that she was disturbed at all. A pleasanter and saner woman\\r\\nthan Mary Datchet was never seen within a committee-room. She seemed a\\r\\ncompound of the autumn leaves and the winter sunshine; less poetically\\r\\nspeaking, she showed both gentleness and strength, an indefinable\\r\\npromise of soft maternity blending with her evident fitness for honest\\r\\nlabor. Nevertheless, she had great difficulty in reducing her mind to\\r\\nobedience; and her reading lacked conviction, as if, as was indeed the\\r\\ncase, she had lost the power of visualizing what she read. And directly\\r\\nthe list was completed, her mind floated to LincolnÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Inn Fields and the\\r\\nfluttering wings of innumerable sparrows. Was Ralph still enticing the\\r\\nbald-headed cock-sparrow to sit upon his hand? Had he succeeded? Would\\r\\nhe ever succeed? She had meant to ask him why it is that the sparrows in\\r\\nLincolnÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Inn Fields are tamer than the sparrows in Hyde Park--perhaps\\r\\nit is that the passers-by are rarer, and they come to recognize their\\r\\nbenefactors. For the first half-hour of the committee meeting, Mary\\r\\nhad thus to do battle with the skeptical presence of Ralph Denham, who\\r\\nthreatened to have it all his own way. Mary tried half a dozen methods\\r\\nof ousting him. She raised her voice, she articulated distinctly, she\\r\\nlooked firmly at Mr. ClactonÃ¢\\x80\\x99s bald head, she began to write a note.\\r\\nTo her annoyance, her pencil drew a little round figure on the\\r\\nblotting-paper, which, she could not deny, was really a bald-headed\\r\\ncock-sparrow. She looked again at Mr. Clacton; yes, he was bald, and so\\r\\nare cock-sparrows. Never was a secretary tormented by so many unsuitable\\r\\nsuggestions, and they all came, alas! with something ludicrously\\r\\ngrotesque about them, which might, at any moment, provoke her to such\\r\\nflippancy as would shock her colleagues for ever. The thought of what\\r\\nshe might say made her bite her lips, as if her lips would protect her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut all these suggestions were but flotsam and jetsam cast to the\\r\\nsurface by a more profound disturbance, which, as she could not consider\\r\\nit at present, manifested its existence by these grotesque nods\\r\\nand beckonings. Consider it, she must, when the committee was over.\\r\\nMeanwhile, she was behaving scandalously; she was looking out of the\\r\\nwindow, and thinking of the color of the sky, and of the decorations\\r\\non the Imperial Hotel, when she ought to have been shepherding her\\r\\ncolleagues, and pinning them down to the matter in hand. She could not\\r\\nbring herself to attach more weight to one project than to another.\\r\\nRalph had said--she could not stop to consider what he had said, but he\\r\\nhad somehow divested the proceedings of all reality. And then, without\\r\\nconscious effort, by some trick of the brain, she found herself becoming\\r\\ninterested in some scheme for organizing a newspaper campaign. Certain\\r\\narticles were to be written; certain editors approached. What line was\\r\\nit advisable to take? She found herself strongly disapproving of what\\r\\nMr. Clacton was saying. She committed herself to the opinion that now\\r\\nwas the time to strike hard. Directly she had said this, she felt that\\r\\nshe had turned upon RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s ghost; and she became more and more in\\r\\nearnest, and anxious to bring the others round to her point of view.\\r\\nOnce more, she knew exactly and indisputably what is right and what\\r\\nis wrong. As if emerging from a mist, the old foes of the public\\r\\ngood loomed ahead of her--capitalists, newspaper proprietors,\\r\\nanti-suffragists, and, in some ways most pernicious of all, the masses\\r\\nwho take no interest one way or another--among whom, for the time being,\\r\\nshe certainly discerned the features of Ralph Denham. Indeed, when Miss\\r\\nMarkham asked her to suggest the names of a few friends of hers, she\\r\\nexpressed herself with unusual bitterness:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy friends think all this kind of thing useless.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She felt that she was\\r\\nreally saying that to Ralph himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re that sort, are they?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Miss Markham, with a little\\r\\nlaugh; and with renewed vigor their legions charged the foe.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s spirits had been low when she entered the committee-room; but now\\r\\nthey were considerably improved. She knew the ways of this world; it was\\r\\na shapely, orderly place; she felt convinced of its right and its\\r\\nwrong; and the feeling that she was fit to deal a heavy blow against her\\r\\nenemies warmed her heart and kindled her eye. In one of those flights of\\r\\nfancy, not characteristic of her but tiresomely frequent this afternoon,\\r\\nshe envisaged herself battered with rotten eggs upon a platform, from\\r\\nwhich Ralph vainly begged her to descend. But--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do I matter compared with the cause?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, and so on. Much to\\r\\nher credit, however teased by foolish fancies, she kept the surface of\\r\\nher brain moderate and vigilant, and subdued Mrs. Seal very tactfully\\r\\nmore than once when she demanded, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAction!--everywhere!--at once!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d as\\r\\nbecame her fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other members of the committee, who were all rather elderly people,\\r\\nwere a good deal impressed by Mary, and inclined to side with her and\\r\\nagainst each other, partly, perhaps, because of her youth. The feeling\\r\\nthat she controlled them all filled Mary with a sense of power; and she\\r\\nfelt that no work can equal in importance, or be so exciting as, the\\r\\nwork of making other people do what you want them to do. Indeed, when\\r\\nshe had won her point she felt a slight degree of contempt for the\\r\\npeople who had yielded to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe committee now rose, gathered together their papers, shook them\\r\\nstraight, placed them in their attache-cases, snapped the locks firmly\\r\\ntogether, and hurried away, having, for the most part, to catch trains,\\r\\nin order to keep other appointments with other committees, for they were\\r\\nall busy people. Mary, Mrs. Seal, and Mr. Clacton were left alone; the\\r\\nroom was hot and untidy, the pieces of pink blotting-paper were lying at\\r\\ndifferent angles upon the table, and the tumbler was half full of water,\\r\\nwhich some one had poured out and forgotten to drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Seal began preparing the tea, while Mr. Clacton retired to his room\\r\\nto file the fresh accumulation of documents. Mary was too much excited\\r\\neven to help Mrs. Seal with the cups and saucers. She flung up the\\r\\nwindow and stood by it, looking out. The street lamps were already lit;\\r\\nand through the mist in the square one could see little figures hurrying\\r\\nacross the road and along the pavement, on the farther side. In her\\r\\nabsurd mood of lustful arrogance, Mary looked at the little figures and\\r\\nthought, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf I liked I could make you go in there or stop short; I could\\r\\nmake you walk in single file or in double file; I could do what I liked\\r\\nwith you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Then Mrs. Seal came and stood by her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOughtnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you to put something round your shoulders, Sally?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary asked,\\r\\nin rather a condescending tone of voice, feeling a sort of pity for the\\r\\nenthusiastic ineffective little woman. But Mrs. Seal paid no attention\\r\\nto the suggestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, did you enjoy yourself?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary asked, with a little laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Seal drew a deep breath, restrained herself, and then burst out,\\r\\nlooking out, too, upon Russell Square and Southampton Row, and at the\\r\\npassers-by, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAh, if only one could get every one of those people into\\r\\nthis room, and make them understand for five minutes! But they MUST see\\r\\nthe truth some day.... If only one could MAKE them see it....Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary knew herself to be very much wiser than Mrs. Seal, and when Mrs.\\r\\nSeal said anything, even if it was what Mary herself was feeling, she\\r\\nautomatically thought of all that there was to be said against it.\\r\\nOn this occasion her arrogant feeling that she could direct everybody\\r\\ndwindled away.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s have our tea,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, turning back from the window and pulling\\r\\ndown the blind. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt was a good meeting--didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you think so, Sally?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nlet fall, casually, as she sat down at the table. Surely Mrs. Seal must\\r\\nrealize that Mary had been extraordinarily efficient?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut we go at such a snailÃ¢\\x80\\x99s pace,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Sally, shaking her head\\r\\nimpatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this Mary burst out laughing, and all her arrogance was dissipated.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou can afford to laugh,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Sally, with another shake of her head,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cbut I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m fifty-five, and I dare say I shall be in my grave by\\r\\nthe time we get it--if we ever do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, no, you wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be in your grave,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, kindly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be such a great day,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Seal, with a toss of her locks.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA great day, not only for us, but for civilization. ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what I feel,\\r\\nyou know, about these meetings. Each one of them is a step onwards in\\r\\nthe great march--humanity, you know. We do want the people after us to\\r\\nhave a better time of it--and so many donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see it. I wonder how it is\\r\\nthat they donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was carrying plates and cups from the cupboard as she spoke, so that\\r\\nher sentences were more than usually broken apart. Mary could not help\\r\\nlooking at the odd little priestess of humanity with something like\\r\\nadmiration. While she had been thinking about herself, Mrs. Seal had\\r\\nthought of nothing but her vision.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou mustnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t wear yourself out, Sally, if you want to see the great\\r\\nday,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, rising and trying to take a plate of biscuits from Mrs.\\r\\nSealÃ¢\\x80\\x99s hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear child, what else is my old body good for?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed,\\r\\nclinging more tightly than before to her plate of biscuits. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nI be proud to give everything I have to the cause?--for IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not an\\r\\nintelligence like you. There were domestic circumstances--IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d like to\\r\\ntell you one of these days--so I say foolish things. I lose my head,\\r\\nyou know. You donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t. Mr. Clacton doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a great mistake, to lose\\r\\noneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s head. But my heartÃ¢\\x80\\x99s in the right place. And IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m so glad Kit has a\\r\\nbig dog, for I didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think her looking well.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had their tea, and went over many of the points that had been\\r\\nraised in the committee rather more intimately than had been possible\\r\\nthen; and they all felt an agreeable sense of being in some way behind\\r\\nthe scenes; of having their hands upon strings which, when pulled, would\\r\\ncompletely change the pageant exhibited daily to those who read the\\r\\nnewspapers. Although their views were very different, this sense united\\r\\nthem and made them almost cordial in their manners to each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, however, left the tea-party rather early, desiring both to be\\r\\nalone, and then to hear some music at the QueenÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Hall. She fully\\r\\nintended to use her loneliness to think out her position with regard to\\r\\nRalph; but although she walked back to the Strand with this end in view,\\r\\nshe found her mind uncomfortably full of different trains of thought.\\r\\nShe started one and then another. They seemed even to take their color\\r\\nfrom the street she happened to be in. Thus the vision of humanity\\r\\nappeared to be in some way connected with Bloomsbury, and faded\\r\\ndistinctly by the time she crossed the main road; then a belated\\r\\norgan-grinder in Holborn set her thoughts dancing incongruously; and\\r\\nby the time she was crossing the great misty square of LincolnÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Inn\\r\\nFields, she was cold and depressed again, and horribly clear-sighted.\\r\\nThe dark removed the stimulus of human companionship, and a tear\\r\\nactually slid down her cheek, accompanying a sudden conviction within\\r\\nher that she loved Ralph, and that he didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t love her. All dark and\\r\\nempty now was the path where they had walked that morning, and the\\r\\nsparrows silent in the bare trees. But the lights in her own building\\r\\nsoon cheered her; all these different states of mind were submerged in\\r\\nthe deep flood of desires, thoughts, perceptions, antagonisms, which\\r\\nwashed perpetually at the base of her being, to rise into prominence in\\r\\nturn when the conditions of the upper world were favorable. She put off\\r\\nthe hour of clear thought until Christmas, saying to herself, as she lit\\r\\nher fire, that it is impossible to think anything out in London; and, no\\r\\ndoubt, Ralph wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t come at Christmas, and she would take long walks\\r\\ninto the heart of the country, and decide this question and all the\\r\\nothers that puzzled her. Meanwhile, she thought, drawing her feet up on\\r\\nto the fender, life was full of complexity; life was a thing one must\\r\\nlove to the last fiber of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had sat there for five minutes or so, and her thoughts had had time\\r\\nto grow dim, when there came a ring at her bell. Her eye brightened;\\r\\nshe felt immediately convinced that Ralph had come to visit her.\\r\\nAccordingly, she waited a moment before opening the door; she wanted\\r\\nto feel her hands secure upon the reins of all the troublesome emotions\\r\\nwhich the sight of Ralph would certainly arouse. She composed herself\\r\\nunnecessarily, however, for she had to admit, not Ralph, but Katharine\\r\\nand William Rodney. Her first impression was that they were both\\r\\nextremely well dressed. She felt herself shabby and slovenly beside\\r\\nthem, and did not know how she should entertain them, nor could she\\r\\nguess why they had come. She had heard nothing of their engagement. But\\r\\nafter the first disappointment, she was pleased, for she felt instantly\\r\\nthat Katharine was a personality, and, moreover, she need not now\\r\\nexercise her self-control.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe were passing and saw a light in your window, so we came up,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Katharine explained, standing and looking very tall and distinguished\\r\\nand rather absent-minded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe have been to see some pictures,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said William. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, dear,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nexclaimed, looking about him, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthis room reminds me of one of the worst\\r\\nhours in my existence--when I read a paper, and you all sat round and\\r\\njeered at me. Katharine was the worst. I could feel her gloating over\\r\\nevery mistake I made. Miss Datchet was kind. Miss Datchet just made it\\r\\npossible for me to get through, I remember.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSitting down, he drew off his light yellow gloves, and began slapping\\r\\nhis knees with them. His vitality was pleasant, Mary thought, although\\r\\nhe made her laugh. The very look of him was inclined to make her laugh.\\r\\nHis rather prominent eyes passed from one young woman to the other, and\\r\\nhis lips perpetually formed words which remained unspoken.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe have been seeing old masters at the Grafton Gallery,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nKatharine, apparently paying no attention to William, and accepting a\\r\\ncigarette which Mary offered her. She leant back in her chair, and the\\r\\nsmoke which hung about her face seemed to withdraw her still further\\r\\nfrom the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWould you believe it, Miss Datchet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William continued, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine\\r\\ndoesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like Titian. She doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like apricots, she doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like\\r\\npeaches, she doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like green peas. She likes the Elgin marbles, and\\r\\ngray days without any sun. SheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a typical example of the cold northern\\r\\nnature. I come from Devonshire--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHad they been quarreling, Mary wondered, and had they, for that reason,\\r\\nsought refuge in her room, or were they engaged, or had Katharine just\\r\\nrefused him? She was completely baffled.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine now reappeared from her veil of smoke, knocked the ash from\\r\\nher cigarette into the fireplace, and looked, with an odd expression of\\r\\nsolicitude, at the irritable man.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps, Mary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said tentatively, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mind giving us some\\r\\ntea? We did try to get some, but the shop was so crowded, and in the\\r\\nnext one there was a band playing; and most of the pictures, at any\\r\\nrate, were very dull, whatever you may say, William.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She spoke with a\\r\\nkind of guarded gentleness.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary, accordingly, retired to make preparations in the pantry.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat in the world are they after?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked of her own reflection in\\r\\nthe little looking-glass which hung there. She was not left to doubt\\r\\nmuch longer, for, on coming back into the sitting-room with the\\r\\ntea-things, Katharine informed her, apparently having been instructed so\\r\\nto do by William, of their engagement.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWilliam,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthinks that perhaps you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know. We are going\\r\\nto be married.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary found herself shaking WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s hand, and addressing her\\r\\ncongratulations to him, as if Katharine were inaccessible; she had,\\r\\nindeed, taken hold of the tea-kettle.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLet me see,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cone puts hot water into the cups first,\\r\\ndoesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t one? You have some dodge of your own, havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you, William,\\r\\nabout making tea?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was half inclined to suspect that this was said in order to conceal\\r\\nnervousness, but if so, the concealment was unusually perfect. Talk\\r\\nof marriage was dismissed. Katharine might have been seated in her\\r\\nown drawing-room, controlling a situation which presented no sort of\\r\\ndifficulty to her trained mind. Rather to her surprise, Mary found\\r\\nherself making conversation with William about old Italian pictures,\\r\\nwhile Katharine poured out tea, cut cake, kept WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s plate supplied,\\r\\nwithout joining more than was necessary in the conversation. She seemed\\r\\nto have taken possession of MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s room, and to handle the cups as\\r\\nif they belonged to her. But it was done so naturally that it bred no\\r\\nresentment in Mary; on the contrary, she found herself putting her hand\\r\\non KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s knee, affectionately, for an instant. Was there something\\r\\nmaternal in this assumption of control? And thinking of Katharine as one\\r\\nwho would soon be married, these maternal airs filled MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mind with a\\r\\nnew tenderness, and even with awe. Katharine seemed very much older and\\r\\nmore experienced than she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Rodney talked. If his appearance was superficially against\\r\\nhim, it had the advantage of making his solid merits something of a\\r\\nsurprise. He had kept notebooks; he knew a great deal about pictures.\\r\\nHe could compare different examples in different galleries, and his\\r\\nauthoritative answers to intelligent questions gained not a little, Mary\\r\\nfelt, from the smart taps which he dealt, as he delivered them, upon the\\r\\nlumps of coal. She was impressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYour tea, William,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine gently.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused, gulped it down, obediently, and continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then it struck Mary that Katharine, in the shade of her\\r\\nbroad-brimmed hat, and in the midst of the smoke, and in the obscurity\\r\\nof her character, was, perhaps, smiling to herself, not altogether in\\r\\nthe maternal spirit. What she said was very simple, but her words, even\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYour tea, William,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d were set down as gently and cautiously and exactly\\r\\nas the feet of a Persian cat stepping among China ornaments. For the\\r\\nsecond time that day Mary felt herself baffled by something inscrutable\\r\\nin the character of a person to whom she felt herself much attracted.\\r\\nShe thought that if she were engaged to Katharine, she, too, would\\r\\nfind herself very soon using those fretful questions with which William\\r\\nevidently teased his bride. And yet KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s voice was humble.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wonder how you find the time to know all about pictures as well as\\r\\nbooks?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow do I find the time?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William answered, delighted, Mary guessed, at\\r\\nthis little compliment. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, I always travel with a notebook. And I ask\\r\\nmy way to the picture gallery the very first thing in the morning. And\\r\\nthen I meet men, and talk to them. ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a man in my office who knows\\r\\nall about the Flemish school. I was telling Miss Datchet about the\\r\\nFlemish school. I picked up a lot of it from him--itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a way men\\r\\nhave--Gibbons, his name is. You must meet him. WeÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll ask him to lunch.\\r\\nAnd this not caring about art,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he explained, turning to Mary, Ã¢\\x80\\x9citÃ¢\\x80\\x99s one\\r\\nof KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s poses, Miss Datchet. Did you know she posed? She pretends\\r\\nthat sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s never read Shakespeare. And why should she read Shakespeare,\\r\\nsince she IS Shakespeare--Rosalind, you know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and he gave his queer\\r\\nlittle chuckle. Somehow this compliment appeared very old-fashioned and\\r\\nalmost in bad taste. Mary actually felt herself blush, as if he had said\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cthe sexÃ¢\\x80\\x9d or Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe ladies.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Constrained, perhaps, by nervousness, Rodney\\r\\ncontinued in the same vein.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe knows enough--enough for all decent purposes. What do you women\\r\\nwant with learning, when you have so much else--everything, I should\\r\\nsay--everything. Leave us something, eh, Katharine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLeave you something?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, apparently waking from a brown\\r\\nstudy. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI was thinking we must be going--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs it to-night that Lady Ferrilby dines with us? No, we mustnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be\\r\\nlate,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Rodney, rising. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDÃ¢\\x80\\x99you know the Ferrilbys, Miss Datchet?\\r\\nThey own Trantem Abbey,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, for her information, as she looked\\r\\ndoubtful. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd if Katharine makes herself very charming to-night,\\r\\nperhapsÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll lend it to us for the honeymoon.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI agree that may be a reason. Otherwise sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a dull woman,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nKatharine. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAt least,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, as if to qualify her abruptness, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nfind it difficult to talk to her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause you expect every one else to take all the trouble. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve seen\\r\\nher sit silent a whole evening,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, turning to Mary, as he had\\r\\nfrequently done already. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you find that, too? Sometimes when weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re\\r\\nalone, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve counted the time on my watchÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--here he took out a large gold\\r\\nwatch, and tapped the glass--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthe time between one remark and the next.\\r\\nAnd once I counted ten minutes and twenty seconds, and then, if youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nbelieve me, she only said Ã¢\\x80\\x98Um!Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sorry,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine apologized. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI know itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a bad habit,\\r\\nbut then, you see, at home--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of her excuse was cut short, so far as Mary was concerned,\\r\\nby the closing of the door. She fancied she could hear William finding\\r\\nfresh fault on the stairs. A moment later, the door-bell rang again, and\\r\\nKatharine reappeared, having left her purse on a chair. She soon found\\r\\nit, and said, pausing for a moment at the door, and speaking differently\\r\\nas they were alone:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think being engaged is very bad for the character.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She shook her\\r\\npurse in her hand until the coins jingled, as if she alluded merely\\r\\nto this example of her forgetfulness. But the remark puzzled Mary;\\r\\nit seemed to refer to something else; and her manner had changed so\\r\\nstrangely, now that William was out of hearing, that she could not help\\r\\nlooking at her for an explanation. She looked almost stern, so that\\r\\nMary, trying to smile at her, only succeeded in producing a silent stare\\r\\nof interrogation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the door shut for the second time, she sank on to the floor in front\\r\\nof the fire, trying, now that their bodies were not there to distract\\r\\nher, to piece together her impressions of them as a whole. And, though\\r\\npriding herself, with all other men and women, upon an infallible eye\\r\\nfor character, she could not feel at all certain that she knew what\\r\\nmotives inspired Katharine Hilbery in life. There was something\\r\\nthat carried her on smoothly, out of reach--something, yes, but\\r\\nwhat?--something that reminded Mary of Ralph. Oddly enough, he gave\\r\\nher the same feeling, too, and with him, too, she felt baffled. Oddly\\r\\nenough, for no two people, she hastily concluded, were more unlike. And\\r\\nyet both had this hidden impulse, this incalculable force--this thing\\r\\nthey cared for and didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t talk about--oh, what was it?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village of Disham lies somewhere on the rolling piece of cultivated\\r\\nground in the neighborhood of Lincoln, not so far inland but that a\\r\\nsound, bringing rumors of the sea, can be heard on summer nights or when\\r\\nthe winter storms fling the waves upon the long beach. So large is\\r\\nthe church, and in particular the church tower, in comparison with the\\r\\nlittle street of cottages which compose the village, that the traveler\\r\\nis apt to cast his mind back to the Middle Ages, as the only time when\\r\\nso much piety could have been kept alive. So great a trust in the Church\\r\\ncan surely not belong to our day, and he goes on to conjecture that\\r\\nevery one of the villagers has reached the extreme limit of human life.\\r\\nSuch are the reflections of the superficial stranger, and his sight of\\r\\nthe population, as it is represented by two or three men hoeing in a\\r\\nturnip-field, a small child carrying a jug, and a young woman shaking\\r\\na piece of carpet outside her cottage door, will not lead him to see\\r\\nanything very much out of keeping with the Middle Ages in the village\\r\\nof Disham as it is to-day. These people, though they seem young enough,\\r\\nlook so angular and so crude that they remind him of the little pictures\\r\\npainted by monks in the capital letters of their manuscripts. He only\\r\\nhalf understands what they say, and speaks very loud and clearly, as\\r\\nthough, indeed, his voice had to carry through a hundred years or\\r\\nmore before it reached them. He would have a far better chance of\\r\\nunderstanding some dweller in Paris or Rome, Berlin or Madrid, than\\r\\nthese countrymen of his who have lived for the last two thousand years\\r\\nnot two hundred miles from the City of London.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rectory stands about half a mile beyond the village. It is a large\\r\\nhouse, and has been growing steadily for some centuries round the great\\r\\nkitchen, with its narrow red tiles, as the Rector would point out to\\r\\nhis guests on the first night of their arrival, taking his brass\\r\\ncandlestick, and bidding them mind the steps up and the steps down,\\r\\nand notice the immense thickness of the walls, the old beams across the\\r\\nceiling, the staircases as steep as ladders, and the attics, with their\\r\\ndeep, tent-like roofs, in which swallows bred, and once a white owl.\\r\\nBut nothing very interesting or very beautiful had resulted from the\\r\\ndifferent additions made by the different rectors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house, however, was surrounded by a garden, in which the Rector took\\r\\nconsiderable pride. The lawn, which fronted the drawing-room windows,\\r\\nwas a rich and uniform green, unspotted by a single daisy, and on the\\r\\nother side of it two straight paths led past beds of tall, standing\\r\\nflowers to a charming grassy walk, where the Rev. Wyndham Datchet would\\r\\npace up and down at the same hour every morning, with a sundial to\\r\\nmeasure the time for him. As often as not, he carried a book in his\\r\\nhand, into which he would glance, then shut it up, and repeat the rest\\r\\nof the ode from memory. He had most of Horace by heart, and had got into\\r\\nthe habit of connecting this particular walk with certain odes which he\\r\\nrepeated duly, at the same time noting the condition of his flowers, and\\r\\nstooping now and again to pick any that were withered or overblown. On\\r\\nwet days, such was the power of habit over him, he rose from his chair\\r\\nat the same hour, and paced his study for the same length of time,\\r\\npausing now and then to straighten some book in the bookcase, or\\r\\nalter the position of the two brass crucifixes standing upon cairns of\\r\\nserpentine stone upon the mantelpiece. His children had a great respect\\r\\nfor him, credited him with far more learning than he actually possessed,\\r\\nand saw that his habits were not interfered with, if possible. Like most\\r\\npeople who do things methodically, the Rector himself had more\\r\\nstrength of purpose and power of self-sacrifice than of intellect or of\\r\\noriginality. On cold and windy nights he rode off to visit sick people,\\r\\nwho might need him, without a murmur; and by virtue of doing dull duties\\r\\npunctually, he was much employed upon committees and local Boards and\\r\\nCouncils; and at this period of his life (he was sixty-eight) he was\\r\\nbeginning to be commiserated by tender old ladies for the extreme\\r\\nleanness of his person, which, they said, was worn out upon the roads\\r\\nwhen it should have been resting before a comfortable fire. His elder\\r\\ndaughter, Elizabeth, lived with him and managed the house, and already\\r\\nmuch resembled him in dry sincerity and methodical habit of mind; of the\\r\\ntwo sons one, Richard, was an estate agent, the other, Christopher, was\\r\\nreading for the Bar. At Christmas, naturally, they met together; and for\\r\\na month past the arrangement of the Christmas week had been much in\\r\\nthe mind of mistress and maid, who prided themselves every year more\\r\\nconfidently upon the excellence of their equipment. The late Mrs.\\r\\nDatchet had left an excellent cupboard of linen, to which Elizabeth had\\r\\nsucceeded at the age of nineteen, when her mother died, and the charge\\r\\nof the family rested upon the shoulders of the eldest daughter. She kept\\r\\na fine flock of yellow chickens, sketched a little, certain rose-trees\\r\\nin the garden were committed specially to her care; and what with the\\r\\ncare of the house, the care of the chickens, and the care of the\\r\\npoor, she scarcely knew what it was to have an idle minute. An extreme\\r\\nrectitude of mind, rather than any gift, gave her weight in the family.\\r\\nWhen Mary wrote to say that she had asked Ralph Denham to stay with\\r\\nthem, she added, out of deference to ElizabethÃ¢\\x80\\x99s character, that he\\r\\nwas very nice, though rather queer, and had been overworking himself in\\r\\nLondon. No doubt Elizabeth would conclude that Ralph was in love with\\r\\nher, but there could be no doubt either that not a word of this would be\\r\\nspoken by either of them, unless, indeed, some catastrophe made mention\\r\\nof it unavoidable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary went down to Disham without knowing whether Ralph intended to come;\\r\\nbut two or three days before Christmas she received a telegram from\\r\\nRalph, asking her to take a room for him in the village. This was\\r\\nfollowed by a letter explaining that he hoped he might have his meals\\r\\nwith them; but quiet, essential for his work, made it necessary to sleep\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was walking in the garden with Elizabeth, and inspecting the roses,\\r\\nwhen the letter arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s absurd,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth decidedly, when the plan was\\r\\nexplained to her. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere are five spare rooms, even when the boys are\\r\\nhere. Besides, he wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t get a room in the village. And he oughtnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t to\\r\\nwork if heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s overworked.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut perhaps he doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to see so much of us,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary thought to\\r\\nherself, although outwardly she assented, and felt grateful to Elizabeth\\r\\nfor supporting her in what was, of course, her desire. They were cutting\\r\\nroses at the time, and laying them, head by head, in a shallow basket.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf Ralph were here, heÃ¢\\x80\\x99d find this very dull,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary thought, with a\\r\\nlittle shiver of irritation, which led her to place her rose the wrong\\r\\nway in the basket. Meanwhile, they had come to the end of the path, and\\r\\nwhile Elizabeth straightened some flowers, and made them stand upright\\r\\nwithin their fence of string, Mary looked at her father, who was\\r\\npacing up and down, with his hand behind his back and his head bowed\\r\\nin meditation. Obeying an impulse which sprang from some desire to\\r\\ninterrupt this methodical marching, Mary stepped on to the grass walk\\r\\nand put her hand on his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA flower for your buttonhole, father,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, presenting a rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEh, dear?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Datchet, taking the flower, and holding it at an\\r\\nangle which suited his bad eyesight, without pausing in his walk.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhere does this fellow come from? One of ElizabethÃ¢\\x80\\x99s roses--I hope you\\r\\nasked her leave. Elizabeth doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like having her roses picked without\\r\\nher leave, and quite right, too.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had a habit, Mary remarked, and she had never noticed it so clearly\\r\\nbefore, of letting his sentences tail away in a continuous murmur,\\r\\nwhereupon he passed into a state of abstraction, presumed by his\\r\\nchildren to indicate some train of thought too profound for utterance.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, interrupting, for the first time in her life,\\r\\nperhaps, when the murmur ceased. He made no reply. She knew very well\\r\\nthat he wished to be left alone, but she stuck to his side much as\\r\\nshe might have stuck to some sleep-walker, whom she thought it right\\r\\ngradually to awaken. She could think of nothing to rouse him with\\r\\nexcept:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe gardenÃ¢\\x80\\x99s looking very nice, father.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, yes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Datchet, running his words together in the\\r\\nsame abstracted manner, and sinking his head yet lower upon his breast.\\r\\nAnd suddenly, as they turned their steps to retrace their way, he jerked\\r\\nout:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe trafficÃ¢\\x80\\x99s very much increased, you know. More rolling-stock needed\\r\\nalready. Forty trucks went down yesterday by the 12.15--counted them\\r\\nmyself. TheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve taken off the 9.3, and given us an 8.30 instead--suits\\r\\nthe business men, you know. You came by the old 3.10 yesterday, I\\r\\nsuppose?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d as he seemed to wish for a reply, and then he looked\\r\\nat his watch, and made off down the path towards the house, holding the\\r\\nrose at the same angle in front of him. Elizabeth had gone round to the\\r\\nside of the house, where the chickens lived, so that Mary found herself\\r\\nalone, holding RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s letter in her hand. She was uneasy. She had put\\r\\noff the season for thinking things out very successfully, and now that\\r\\nRalph was actually coming, the next day, she could only wonder how her\\r\\nfamily would impress him. She thought it likely that her father would\\r\\ndiscuss the train service with him; Elizabeth would be bright and\\r\\nsensible, and always leaving the room to give messages to the servants.\\r\\nHer brothers had already said that they would give him a dayÃ¢\\x80\\x99s shooting.\\r\\nShe was content to leave the problem of RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s relations to the\\r\\nyoung men obscure, trusting that they would find some common ground of\\r\\nmasculine agreement. But what would he think of HER? Would he see that\\r\\nshe was different from the rest of the family? She devised a plan for\\r\\ntaking him to her sitting-room, and artfully leading the talk towards\\r\\nthe English poets, who now occupied prominent places in her little\\r\\nbookcase. Moreover, she might give him to understand, privately, that\\r\\nshe, too, thought her family a queer one--queer, yes, but not dull. That\\r\\nwas the rock past which she was bent on steering him. And she thought\\r\\nhow she would draw his attention to EdwardÃ¢\\x80\\x99s passion for Jorrocks, and\\r\\nthe enthusiasm which led Christopher to collect moths and butterflies\\r\\nthough he was now twenty-two. Perhaps ElizabethÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sketching, if the\\r\\nfruits were invisible, might lend color to the general effect which she\\r\\nwished to produce of a family, eccentric and limited, perhaps, but\\r\\nnot dull. Edward, she perceived, was rolling the lawn, for the sake of\\r\\nexercise; and the sight of him, with pink cheeks, bright little brown\\r\\neyes, and a general resemblance to a clumsy young cart-horse in its\\r\\nwinter coat of dusty brown hair, made Mary violently ashamed of her\\r\\nambitious scheming. She loved him precisely as he was; she loved them\\r\\nall; and as she walked by his side, up and down, and down and up,\\r\\nher strong moral sense administered a sound drubbing to the vain and\\r\\nromantic element aroused in her by the mere thought of Ralph. She felt\\r\\nquite certain that, for good or for bad, she was very like the rest of\\r\\nher family.\\r\\n\\r\\nSitting in the corner of a third-class railway carriage, on the\\r\\nafternoon of the following day, Ralph made several inquiries of a\\r\\ncommercial traveler in the opposite corner. They centered round a\\r\\nvillage called Lampsher, not three miles, he understood, from Lincoln;\\r\\nwas there a big house in Lampsher, he asked, inhabited by a gentleman of\\r\\nthe name of Otway?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe traveler knew nothing, but rolled the name of Otway on his tongue,\\r\\nreflectively, and the sound of it gratified Ralph amazingly. It gave\\r\\nhim an excuse to take a letter from his pocket in order to verify the\\r\\naddress.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cStogdon House, Lampsher, Lincoln,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he read out.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll find somebody to direct you at Lincoln,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the man; and Ralph\\r\\nhad to confess that he was not bound there this very evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got to walk over from Disham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, and in the heart of him\\r\\ncould not help marveling at the pleasure which he derived from making\\r\\na bagman in a train believe what he himself did not believe. For the\\r\\nletter, though signed by KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s father, contained no invitation or\\r\\nwarrant for thinking that Katharine herself was there; the only fact it\\r\\ndisclosed was that for a fortnight this address would be Mr. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\naddress. But when he looked out of the window, it was of her he thought;\\r\\nshe, too, had seen these gray fields, and, perhaps, she was there where\\r\\nthe trees ran up a slope, and one yellow light shone now, and then went\\r\\nout again, at the foot of the hill. The light shone in the windows of\\r\\nan old gray house, he thought. He lay back in his corner and forgot the\\r\\ncommercial traveler altogether. The process of visualizing Katharine\\r\\nstopped short at the old gray manor-house; instinct warned him that if\\r\\nhe went much further with this process reality would soon force itself\\r\\nin; he could not altogether neglect the figure of William Rodney. Since\\r\\nthe day when he had heard from KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s lips of her engagement, he\\r\\nhad refrained from investing his dream of her with the details of\\r\\nreal life. But the light of the late afternoon glowed green behind the\\r\\nstraight trees, and became a symbol of her. The light seemed to expand\\r\\nhis heart. She brooded over the gray fields, and was with him now in\\r\\nthe railway carriage, thoughtful, silent, and infinitely tender; but\\r\\nthe vision pressed too close, and must be dismissed, for the train\\r\\nwas slackening. Its abrupt jerks shook him wide awake, and he saw Mary\\r\\nDatchet, a sturdy russet figure, with a dash of scarlet about it, as the\\r\\ncarriage slid down the platform. A tall youth who accompanied her shook\\r\\nhim by the hand, took his bag, and led the way without uttering one\\r\\narticulate word.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever are voices so beautiful as on a winterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s evening, when dusk almost\\r\\nhides the body, and they seem to issue from nothingness with a note of\\r\\nintimacy seldom heard by day. Such an edge was there in MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s voice\\r\\nwhen she greeted him. About her seemed to hang the mist of the winter\\r\\nhedges, and the clear red of the bramble leaves. He felt himself at once\\r\\nstepping on to the firm ground of an entirely different world, but he\\r\\ndid not allow himself to yield to the pleasure of it directly. They\\r\\ngave him his choice of driving with Edward or of walking home across the\\r\\nfields with Mary--not a shorter way, they explained, but Mary thought it\\r\\na nicer way. He decided to walk with her, being conscious, indeed,\\r\\nthat he got comfort from her presence. What could be the cause of her\\r\\ncheerfulness, he wondered, half ironically, and half enviously, as the\\r\\npony-cart started briskly away, and the dusk swam between their eyes\\r\\nand the tall form of Edward, standing up to drive, with the reins in one\\r\\nhand and the whip in the other. People from the village, who had been to\\r\\nthe market town, were climbing into their gigs, or setting off home down\\r\\nthe road together in little parties. Many salutations were addressed\\r\\nto Mary, who shouted back, with the addition of the speakerÃ¢\\x80\\x99s name. But\\r\\nsoon she led the way over a stile, and along a path worn slightly darker\\r\\nthan the dim green surrounding it. In front of them the sky now showed\\r\\nitself of a reddish-yellow, like a slice of some semilucent stone behind\\r\\nwhich a lamp burnt, while a fringe of black trees with distinct branches\\r\\nstood against the light, which was obscured in one direction by a hump\\r\\nof earth, in all other directions the land lying flat to the very verge\\r\\nof the sky. One of the swift and noiseless birds of the winterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s night\\r\\nseemed to follow them across the field, circling a few feet in front of\\r\\nthem, disappearing and returning again and again.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had gone this walk many hundred times in the course of her life,\\r\\ngenerally alone, and at different stages the ghosts of past moods would\\r\\nflood her mind with a whole scene or train of thought merely at the\\r\\nsight of three trees from a particular angle, or at the sound of the\\r\\npheasant clucking in the ditch. But to-night the circumstances were\\r\\nstrong enough to oust all other scenes; and she looked at the field\\r\\nand the trees with an involuntary intensity as if they had no such\\r\\nassociations for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Ralph,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthis is better than LincolnÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Inn Fields,\\r\\nisnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it? Look, thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a bird for you! Oh, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve brought glasses, have\\r\\nyou? Edward and Christopher mean to make you shoot. Can you shoot? I\\r\\nshouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think so--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLook here, you must explain,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWho are these young men?\\r\\nWhere am I staying?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are staying with us, of course,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said boldly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course,\\r\\nyouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re staying with us--you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mind coming, do you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf I had, I shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have come,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said sturdily. They walked on in\\r\\nsilence; Mary took care not to break it for a time. She wished Ralph to\\r\\nfeel, as she thought he would, all the fresh delights of the earth and\\r\\nair. She was right. In a moment he expressed his pleasure, much to her\\r\\ncomfort.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is the sort of country I thought youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d live in, Mary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said,\\r\\npushing his hat back on his head, and looking about him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cReal country.\\r\\nNo gentlemenÃ¢\\x80\\x99s seats.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe snuffed the air, and felt more keenly than he had done for many weeks\\r\\nthe pleasure of owning a body.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow we have to find our way through a hedge,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary. In the gap of\\r\\nthe hedge Ralph tore up a poacherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s wire, set across a hole to trap a\\r\\nrabbit.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s quite right that they should poach,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, watching him\\r\\ntugging at the wire. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wonder whether it was Alfred Duggins or Sid\\r\\nRankin? How can one expect them not to, when they only make fifteen\\r\\nshillings a week? Fifteen shillings a week,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she repeated, coming out on\\r\\nthe other side of the hedge, and running her fingers through her hair to\\r\\nrid herself of a bramble which had attached itself to her. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI could live\\r\\non fifteen shillings a week--easily.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCould you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe you could,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh yes. They have a cottage thrown in, and a garden where one can grow\\r\\nvegetables. It wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be half bad,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, with a soberness which\\r\\nimpressed Ralph very much.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d get tired of it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he urged.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI sometimes think itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the only thing one would never get tired of,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of a cottage where one grew oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s own vegetables and lived on\\r\\nfifteen shillings a week, filled Ralph with an extraordinary sense of\\r\\nrest and satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it be on the main road, or next door to a woman with\\r\\nsix squalling children, whoÃ¢\\x80\\x99d always be hanging her washing out to dry\\r\\nacross your garden?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe cottage IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m thinking of stands by itself in a little orchard.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd what about the Suffrage?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked, attempting sarcasm.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, there are other things in the world besides the Suffrage,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nreplied, in an off-hand manner which was slightly mysterious.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph fell silent. It annoyed him that she should have plans of which he\\r\\nknew nothing; but he felt that he had no right to press her further. His\\r\\nmind settled upon the idea of life in a country cottage. Conceivably,\\r\\nfor he could not examine into it now, here lay a tremendous possibility;\\r\\na solution of many problems. He struck his stick upon the earth, and\\r\\nstared through the dusk at the shape of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDÃ¢\\x80\\x99you know the points of the compass?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, of course,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat dÃ¢\\x80\\x99you take me for?--a Cockney like\\r\\nyou?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She then told him exactly where the north lay, and where the\\r\\nsouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s my native land, this,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI could smell my way about it\\r\\nblindfold.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if to prove this boast, she walked a little quicker, so that Ralph\\r\\nfound it difficult to keep pace with her. At the same time, he felt\\r\\ndrawn to her as he had never been before; partly, no doubt, because she\\r\\nwas more independent of him than in London, and seemed to be attached\\r\\nfirmly to a world where he had no place at all. Now the dusk had fallen\\r\\nto such an extent that he had to follow her implicitly, and even lean\\r\\nhis hand on her shoulder when they jumped a bank into a very narrow\\r\\nlane. And he felt curiously shy of her when she began to shout through\\r\\nher hands at a spot of light which swung upon the mist in a neighboring\\r\\nfield. He shouted, too, and the light stood still.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Christopher, come in already, and gone to feed his chickens,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe introduced him to Ralph, who could see only a tall figure in\\r\\ngaiters, rising from a fluttering circle of soft feathery bodies, upon\\r\\nwhom the light fell in wavering discs, calling out now a bright spot of\\r\\nyellow, now one of greenish-black and scarlet. Mary dipped her hand in\\r\\nthe bucket he carried, and was at once the center of a circle also; and\\r\\nas she cast her grain she talked alternately to the birds and to her\\r\\nbrother, in the same clucking, half-inarticulate voice, as it sounded to\\r\\nRalph, standing on the outskirts of the fluttering feathers in his black\\r\\novercoat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had removed his overcoat by the time they sat round the dinner-table,\\r\\nbut nevertheless he looked very strange among the others. A country life\\r\\nand breeding had preserved in them all a look which Mary hesitated to\\r\\ncall either innocent or youthful, as she compared them, now sitting\\r\\nround in an oval, softly illuminated by candlelight; and yet it was\\r\\nsomething of the kind, yes, even in the case of the Rector himself.\\r\\nThough superficially marked with lines, his face was a clear pink, and\\r\\nhis blue eyes had the long-sighted, peaceful expression of eyes seeking\\r\\nthe turn of the road, or a distant light through rain, or the darkness\\r\\nof winter. She looked at Ralph. He had never appeared to her more\\r\\nconcentrated and full of purpose; as if behind his forehead were massed\\r\\nso much experience that he could choose for himself which part of it\\r\\nhe would display and which part he would keep to himself. Compared with\\r\\nthat dark and stern countenance, her brothersÃ¢\\x80\\x99 faces, bending low over\\r\\ntheir soup-plates, were mere circles of pink, unmolded flesh.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou came by the 3.10, Mr. Denham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the Reverend Wyndham Datchet,\\r\\ntucking his napkin into his collar, so that almost the whole of his body\\r\\nwas concealed by a large white diamond. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThey treat us very well, on\\r\\nthe whole. Considering the increase of traffic, they treat us very well\\r\\nindeed. I have the curiosity sometimes to count the trucks on the goodsÃ¢\\x80\\x99\\r\\ntrains, and theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re well over fifty--well over fifty, at this season of\\r\\nthe year.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old gentleman had been roused agreeably by the presence of this\\r\\nattentive and well-informed young man, as was evident by the care\\r\\nwith which he finished the last words in his sentences, and his slight\\r\\nexaggeration in the number of trucks on the trains. Indeed, the chief\\r\\nburden of the talk fell upon him, and he sustained it to-night in a\\r\\nmanner which caused his sons to look at him admiringly now and then; for\\r\\nthey felt shy of Denham, and were glad not to have to talk themselves.\\r\\nThe store of information about the present and past of this particular\\r\\ncorner of Lincolnshire which old Mr. Datchet produced really surprised\\r\\nhis children, for though they knew of its existence, they had forgotten\\r\\nits extent, as they might have forgotten the amount of family plate\\r\\nstored in the plate-chest, until some rare celebration brought it forth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dinner, parish business took the Rector to his study, and Mary\\r\\nproposed that they should sit in the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not the kitchen really,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Elizabeth hastened to explain to her\\r\\nguest, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut we call it so--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the nicest room in the house,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Edward.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s got the old rests by the side of the fireplace, where the men\\r\\nhung their guns,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth, leading the way, with a tall brass\\r\\ncandlestick in her hand, down a passage. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShow Mr. Denham the steps,\\r\\nChristopher.... When the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were here two\\r\\nyears ago they said this was the most interesting part of the house.\\r\\nThese narrow bricks prove that it is five hundred years old--five\\r\\nhundred years, I think--they may have said six.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She, too, felt\\r\\nan impulse to exaggerate the age of the bricks, as her father had\\r\\nexaggerated the number of trucks. A big lamp hung down from the center\\r\\nof the ceiling and, together with a fine log fire, illuminated a large\\r\\nand lofty room, with rafters running from wall to wall, a floor of red\\r\\ntiles, and a substantial fireplace built up of those narrow red\\r\\nbricks which were said to be five hundred years old. A few rugs and\\r\\na sprinkling of arm-chairs had made this ancient kitchen into a\\r\\nsitting-room. Elizabeth, after pointing out the gun-racks, and the\\r\\nhooks for smoking hams, and other evidence of incontestable age,\\r\\nand explaining that Mary had had the idea of turning the room into a\\r\\nsitting-room--otherwise it was used for hanging out the wash and for the\\r\\nmen to change in after shooting--considered that she had done her duty\\r\\nas hostess, and sat down in an upright chair directly beneath the lamp,\\r\\nbeside a very long and narrow oak table. She placed a pair of horn\\r\\nspectacles upon her nose, and drew towards her a basketful of threads\\r\\nand wools. In a few minutes a smile came to her face, and remained there\\r\\nfor the rest of the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWill you come out shooting with us to-morrow?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Christopher, who\\r\\nhad, on the whole, formed a favorable impression of his sisterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t shoot, but IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll come with you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you care about shooting?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d asked Edward, whose suspicions were not\\r\\nyet laid to rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve never shot in my life,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph, turning and looking him in the\\r\\nface, because he was not sure how this confession would be received.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have much chance in London, I suppose,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Christopher.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you find it rather dull--just watching us?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI shall watch birds,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph replied, with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI can show you the place for watching birds,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Edward, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwhat you like doing. I know a fellow who comes down from London about\\r\\nthis time every year to watch them. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a great place for the wild\\r\\ngeese and the ducks. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve heard this man say that itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s one of the best\\r\\nplaces for birds in the country.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s about the best place in England,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph replied. They were all\\r\\ngratified by this praise of their native county; and Mary now had\\r\\nthe pleasure of hearing these short questions and answers lose their\\r\\nundertone of suspicious inspection, so far as her brothers were\\r\\nconcerned, and develop into a genuine conversation about the habits\\r\\nof birds which afterwards turned to a discussion as to the habits of\\r\\nsolicitors, in which it was scarcely necessary for her to take part. She\\r\\nwas pleased to see that her brothers liked Ralph, to the extent, that\\r\\nis, of wishing to secure his good opinion. Whether or not he liked them\\r\\nit was impossible to tell from his kind but experienced manner. Now and\\r\\nthen she fed the fire with a fresh log, and as the room filled with\\r\\nthe fine, dry heat of burning wood, they all, with the exception of\\r\\nElizabeth, who was outside the range of the fire, felt less and less\\r\\nanxious about the effect they were making, and more and more inclined\\r\\nfor sleep. At this moment a vehement scratching was heard on the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPiper!--oh, damn!--I shall have to get up,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d murmured Christopher.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not Piper, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Pitch,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Edward grunted.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAll the same, I shall have to get up,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Christopher grumbled. He let\\r\\nin the dog, and stood for a moment by the door, which opened into the\\r\\ngarden, to revive himself with a draught of the black, starlit air.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo come in and shut the door!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary cried, half turning in her chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe shall have a fine day to-morrow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Christopher with complacency,\\r\\nand he sat himself on the floor at her feet, and leant his back against\\r\\nher knees, and stretched out his long stockinged legs to the fire--all\\r\\nsigns that he felt no longer any restraint at the presence of the\\r\\nstranger. He was the youngest of the family, and MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s favorite, partly\\r\\nbecause his character resembled hers, as EdwardÃ¢\\x80\\x99s character resembled\\r\\nElizabethÃ¢\\x80\\x99s. She made her knees a comfortable rest for his head, and ran\\r\\nher fingers through his hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should like Mary to stroke my head like that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph thought to\\r\\nhimself suddenly, and he looked at Christopher, almost affectionately,\\r\\nfor calling forth his sisterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s caresses. Instantly he thought of\\r\\nKatharine, the thought of her being surrounded by the spaces of night\\r\\nand the open air; and Mary, watching him, saw the lines upon his\\r\\nforehead suddenly deepen. He stretched out an arm and placed a log upon\\r\\nthe fire, constraining himself to fit it carefully into the frail red\\r\\nscaffolding, and also to limit his thoughts to this one room.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had ceased to stroke her brotherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s head; he moved it impatiently\\r\\nbetween her knees, and, much as though he were a child, she began once\\r\\nmore to part the thick, reddish-colored locks this way and that. But\\r\\na far stronger passion had taken possession of her soul than any her\\r\\nbrother could inspire in her, and, seeing RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s change of expression,\\r\\nher hand almost automatically continued its movements, while her mind\\r\\nplunged desperately for some hold upon slippery banks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI\\r\\n\\r\\nInto that same black night, almost, indeed, into the very same layer of\\r\\nstarlit air, Katharine Hilbery was now gazing, although not with a view\\r\\nto the prospects of a fine day for duck shooting on the morrow. She was\\r\\nwalking up and down a gravel path in the garden of Stogdon House, her\\r\\nsight of the heavens being partially intercepted by the light leafless\\r\\nhoops of a pergola. Thus a spray of clematis would completely obscure\\r\\nCassiopeia, or blot out with its black pattern myriads of miles of the\\r\\nMilky Way. At the end of the pergola, however, there was a stone seat,\\r\\nfrom which the sky could be seen completely swept clear of any earthly\\r\\ninterruption, save to the right, indeed, where a line of elm-trees was\\r\\nbeautifully sprinkled with stars, and a low stable building had a full\\r\\ndrop of quivering silver just issuing from the mouth of the chimney. It\\r\\nwas a moonless night, but the light of the stars was sufficient to show\\r\\nthe outline of the young womanÃ¢\\x80\\x99s form, and the shape of her face gazing\\r\\ngravely, indeed almost sternly, into the sky. She had come out into\\r\\nthe winterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s night, which was mild enough, not so much to look with\\r\\nscientific eyes upon the stars, as to shake herself free from certain\\r\\npurely terrestrial discontents. Much as a literary person in like\\r\\ncircumstances would begin, absent-mindedly, pulling out volume after\\r\\nvolume, so she stepped into the garden in order to have the stars at\\r\\nhand, even though she did not look at them. Not to be happy, when she\\r\\nwas supposed to be happier than she would ever be again--that, as far as\\r\\nshe could see, was the origin of a discontent which had begun almost as\\r\\nsoon as she arrived, two days before, and seemed now so intolerable\\r\\nthat she had left the family party, and come out here to consider it by\\r\\nherself. It was not she who thought herself unhappy, but her cousins,\\r\\nwho thought it for her. The house was full of cousins, much of her age,\\r\\nor even younger, and among them they had some terribly bright eyes. They\\r\\nseemed always on the search for something between her and Rodney, which\\r\\nthey expected to find, and yet did not find; and when they searched,\\r\\nKatharine became aware of wanting what she had not been conscious of\\r\\nwanting in London, alone with William and her parents. Or, if she\\r\\ndid not want it, she missed it. And this state of mind depressed her,\\r\\nbecause she had been accustomed always to give complete satisfaction,\\r\\nand her self-love was now a little ruffled. She would have liked to\\r\\nbreak through the reserve habitual to her in order to justify her\\r\\nengagement to some one whose opinion she valued. No one had spoken a\\r\\nword of criticism, but they left her alone with William; not that that\\r\\nwould have mattered, if they had not left her alone so politely; and,\\r\\nperhaps, that would not have mattered if they had not seemed so queerly\\r\\nsilent, almost respectful, in her presence, which gave way to criticism,\\r\\nshe felt, out of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking now and then at the sky, she went through the list of her\\r\\ncousinsÃ¢\\x80\\x99 names: Eleanor, Humphrey, Marmaduke, Silvia, Henry, Cassandra,\\r\\nGilbert, and Mostyn--Henry, the cousin who taught the young ladies\\r\\nof Bungay to play upon the violin, was the only one in whom she could\\r\\nconfide, and as she walked up and down beneath the hoops of the pergola,\\r\\nshe did begin a little speech to him, which ran something like this:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTo begin with, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m very fond of William. You canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t deny that. I know\\r\\nhim better than any one, almost. But why IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m marrying him is, partly,\\r\\nI admit--IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m being quite honest with you, and you mustnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t tell any\\r\\none--partly because I want to get married. I want to have a house of my\\r\\nown. It isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t possible at home. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all very well for you, Henry; you\\r\\ncan go your own way. I have to be there always. Besides, you know what\\r\\nour house is. You wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be happy either, if you didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t do something.\\r\\nIt isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t that I havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t the time at home--itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the atmosphere.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Here,\\r\\npresumably, she imagined that her cousin, who had listened with\\r\\nhis usual intelligent sympathy, raised his eyebrows a little, and\\r\\ninterposed:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, but what do you want to do?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEven in this purely imaginary dialogue, Katharine found it difficult to\\r\\nconfide her ambition to an imaginary companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should like,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she began, and hesitated quite a long time before she\\r\\nforced herself to add, with a change of voice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto study mathematics--to\\r\\nknow about the stars.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry was clearly amazed, but too kind to express all his doubts; he\\r\\nonly said something about the difficulties of mathematics, and remarked\\r\\nthat very little was known about the stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine thereupon went on with the statement of her case.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t care much whether I ever get to know anything--but I want to\\r\\nwork out something in figures--something that hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t got to do with\\r\\nhuman beings. I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want people particularly. In some ways, Henry, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m\\r\\na humbug--I mean, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not what you all take me for. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not domestic, or\\r\\nvery practical or sensible, really. And if I could calculate things, and\\r\\nuse a telescope, and have to work out figures, and know to a fraction\\r\\nwhere I was wrong, I should be perfectly happy, and I believe I should\\r\\ngive William all he wants.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving reached this point, instinct told her that she had passed beyond\\r\\nthe region in which HenryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s advice could be of any good; and, having rid\\r\\nher mind of its superficial annoyance, she sat herself upon the stone\\r\\nseat, raised her eyes unconsciously and thought about the deeper\\r\\nquestions which she had to decide, she knew, for herself. Would she,\\r\\nindeed, give William all he wanted? In order to decide the question, she\\r\\nran her mind rapidly over her little collection of significant sayings,\\r\\nlooks, compliments, gestures, which had marked their intercourse during\\r\\nthe last day or two. He had been annoyed because a box, containing some\\r\\nclothes specially chosen by him for her to wear, had been taken to the\\r\\nwrong station, owing to her neglect in the matter of labels. The box had\\r\\narrived in the nick of time, and he had remarked, as she came downstairs\\r\\non the first night, that he had never seen her look more beautiful. She\\r\\noutshone all her cousins. He had discovered that she never made an ugly\\r\\nmovement; he also said that the shape of her head made it possible for\\r\\nher, unlike most women, to wear her hair low. He had twice reproved\\r\\nher for being silent at dinner; and once for never attending to what he\\r\\nsaid. He had been surprised at the excellence of her French accent, but\\r\\nhe thought it was selfish of her not to go with her mother to call\\r\\nupon the Middletons, because they were old family friends and very nice\\r\\npeople. On the whole, the balance was nearly even; and, writing down a\\r\\nkind of conclusion in her mind which finished the sum for the present,\\r\\nat least, she changed the focus of her eyes, and saw nothing but the\\r\\nstars.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-night they seemed fixed with unusual firmness in the blue, and\\r\\nflashed back such a ripple of light into her eyes that she found herself\\r\\nthinking that to-night the stars were happy. Without knowing or caring\\r\\nmore for Church practices than most people of her age, Katharine could\\r\\nnot look into the sky at Christmas time without feeling that, at this\\r\\none season, the Heavens bend over the earth with sympathy, and signal\\r\\nwith immortal radiance that they, too, take part in her festival.\\r\\nSomehow, it seemed to her that they were even now beholding the\\r\\nprocession of kings and wise men upon some road on a distant part of\\r\\nthe earth. And yet, after gazing for another second, the stars did their\\r\\nusual work upon the mind, froze to cinders the whole of our short\\r\\nhuman history, and reduced the human body to an ape-like, furry form,\\r\\ncrouching amid the brushwood of a barbarous clod of mud. This stage was\\r\\nsoon succeeded by another, in which there was nothing in the universe\\r\\nsave stars and the light of stars; as she looked up the pupils of her\\r\\neyes so dilated with starlight that the whole of her seemed dissolved\\r\\nin silver and spilt over the ledges of the stars for ever and\\r\\never indefinitely through space. Somehow simultaneously, though\\r\\nincongruously, she was riding with the magnanimous hero upon the shore\\r\\nor under forest trees, and so might have continued were it not for the\\r\\nrebuke forcibly administered by the body, which, content with the normal\\r\\nconditions of life, in no way furthers any attempt on the part of the\\r\\nmind to alter them. She grew cold, shook herself, rose, and walked\\r\\ntowards the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the light of the stars, Stogdon House looked pale and romantic, and\\r\\nabout twice its natural size. Built by a retired admiral in the early\\r\\nyears of the nineteenth century, the curving bow windows of the front,\\r\\nnow filled with reddish-yellow light, suggested a portly three-decker,\\r\\nsailing seas where those dolphins and narwhals who disport themselves\\r\\nupon the edges of old maps were scattered with an impartial hand. A\\r\\nsemicircular flight of shallow steps led to a very large door, which\\r\\nKatharine had left ajar. She hesitated, cast her eyes over the front of\\r\\nthe house, marked that a light burnt in one small window upon an upper\\r\\nfloor, and pushed the door open. For a moment she stood in the square\\r\\nhall, among many horned skulls, sallow globes, cracked oil-paintings,\\r\\nand stuffed owls, hesitating, it seemed, whether she should open the\\r\\ndoor on her right, through which the stir of life reached her ears.\\r\\nListening for a moment, she heard a sound which decided her, apparently,\\r\\nnot to enter; her uncle, Sir Francis, was playing his nightly game of\\r\\nwhist; it appeared probable that he was losing.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went up the curving stairway, which represented the one attempt at\\r\\nceremony in the otherwise rather dilapidated mansion, and down a narrow\\r\\npassage until she came to the room whose light she had seen from the\\r\\ngarden. Knocking, she was told to come in. A young man, Henry Otway,\\r\\nwas reading, with his feet on the fender. He had a fine head, the brow\\r\\narched in the Elizabethan manner, but the gentle, honest eyes were\\r\\nrather skeptical than glowing with the Elizabethan vigor. He gave\\r\\nthe impression that he had not yet found the cause which suited his\\r\\ntemperament.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned, put down his book, and looked at her. He noticed her rather\\r\\npale, dew-drenched look, as of one whose mind is not altogether settled\\r\\nin the body. He had often laid his difficulties before her, and guessed,\\r\\nin some ways hoped, that perhaps she now had need of him. At the same\\r\\ntime, she carried on her life with such independence that he scarcely\\r\\nexpected any confidence to be expressed in words.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou have fled, too, then?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, looking at her cloak. Katharine had\\r\\nforgotten to remove this token of her star-gazing.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFled?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFrom whom dÃ¢\\x80\\x99you mean? Oh, the family party. Yes, it\\r\\nwas hot down there, so I went into the garden.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you very cold?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Henry inquired, placing coal on the fire,\\r\\ndrawing a chair up to the grate, and laying aside her cloak. Her\\r\\nindifference to such details often forced Henry to act the part\\r\\ngenerally taken by women in such dealings. It was one of the ties\\r\\nbetween them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThank you, Henry,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not disturbing you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not here. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m at Bungay,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m giving a music lesson\\r\\nto Harold and Julia. That was why I had to leave the table with the\\r\\nladies--IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m spending the night there, and I shanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be back till late on\\r\\nChristmas Eve.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow I wish--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine began, and stopped short. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think these\\r\\nparties are a great mistake,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added briefly, and sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, horrible!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he agreed; and they both fell silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sigh made him look at her. Should he venture to ask her why she\\r\\nsighed? Was her reticence about her own affairs as inviolable as it had\\r\\noften been convenient for rather an egoistical young man to think it?\\r\\nBut since her engagement to Rodney, HenryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s feeling towards her had\\r\\nbecome rather complex; equally divided between an impulse to hurt her\\r\\nand an impulse to be tender to her; and all the time he suffered a\\r\\ncurious irritation from the sense that she was drifting away from him\\r\\nfor ever upon unknown seas. On her side, directly Katharine got into his\\r\\npresence, and the sense of the stars dropped from her, she knew that any\\r\\nintercourse between people is extremely partial; from the whole mass of\\r\\nher feelings, only one or two could be selected for HenryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s inspection,\\r\\nand therefore she sighed. Then she looked at him, and their eyes\\r\\nmeeting, much more seemed to be in common between them than had appeared\\r\\npossible. At any rate they had a grandfather in common; at any rate\\r\\nthere was a kind of loyalty between them sometimes found between\\r\\nrelations who have no other cause to like each other, as these two had.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, whatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the date of the wedding?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Henry, the malicious mood\\r\\nnow predominating.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think some time in March,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd afterwards?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe take a house, I suppose, somewhere in Chelsea.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s very interesting,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he observed, stealing another look at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe lay back in her arm-chair, her feet high upon the side of the grate,\\r\\nand in front of her, presumably to screen her eyes, she held a newspaper\\r\\nfrom which she picked up a sentence or two now and again. Observing\\r\\nthis, Henry remarked:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps marriage will make you more human.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this she lowered the newspaper an inch or two, but said nothing.\\r\\nIndeed, she sat quite silent for over a minute.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen you consider things like the stars, our affairs donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t seem to\\r\\nmatter very much, do they?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think I ever do consider things like the stars,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Henry replied.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not sure that thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not the explanation, though,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, now\\r\\nobserving her steadily.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI doubt whether there is an explanation,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied rather hurriedly,\\r\\nnot clearly understanding what he meant.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat? No explanation of anything?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he inquired, with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, things happen. ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s about all,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she let drop in her casual,\\r\\ndecided way.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat certainly seems to explain some of your actions,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Henry thought to\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOne thingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s about as good as another, and oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s got to do something,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n he said aloud, expressing what he supposed to be her attitude, much in\\r\\nher accent. Perhaps she detected the imitation, for looking gently at\\r\\nhim, she said, with ironical composure:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, if you believe that your life must be simple, Henry.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said shortly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo more do I,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat about the stars?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked a moment later. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI understand that you\\r\\nrule your life by the stars?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe let this pass, either because she did not attend to it, or because\\r\\nthe tone was not to her liking.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more she paused, and then she inquired:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut do you always understand why you do everything? Ought one to\\r\\nunderstand? People like my mother understand,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she reflected. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow I\\r\\nmust go down to them, I suppose, and see whatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s happening.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat could be happening?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Henry protested.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, they may want to settle something,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied vaguely, putting\\r\\nher feet on the ground, resting her chin on her hands, and looking out\\r\\nof her large dark eyes contemplatively at the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd then thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s William,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, as if by an afterthought.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry very nearly laughed, but restrained himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo they know what coals are made of, Henry?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked, a moment later.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMaresÃ¢\\x80\\x99 tails, I believe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he hazarded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you ever been down a coal-mine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went on.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t letÃ¢\\x80\\x99s talk about coal-mines, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he protested. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe shall\\r\\nprobably never see each other again. When youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re married--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTremendously to his surprise, he saw the tears stand in her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy do you all tease me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t kind.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry could not pretend that he was altogether ignorant of her meaning,\\r\\nthough, certainly, he had never guessed that she minded the teasing. But\\r\\nbefore he knew what to say, her eyes were clear again, and the sudden\\r\\ncrack in the surface was almost filled up.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThings arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t easy, anyhow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she stated.\\r\\n\\r\\nObeying an impulse of genuine affection, Henry spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPromise me, Katharine, that if I can ever help you, you will let me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe seemed to consider, looking once more into the red of the fire, and\\r\\ndecided to refrain from any explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I promise that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said at length, and Henry felt himself\\r\\ngratified by her complete sincerity, and began to tell her now about the\\r\\ncoal-mine, in obedience to her love of facts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were, indeed, descending the shaft in a small cage, and could hear\\r\\nthe picks of the miners, something like the gnawing of rats, in the\\r\\nearth beneath them, when the door was burst open, without any knocking.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, here you are!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney exclaimed. Both Katharine and Henry turned\\r\\nround very quickly and rather guiltily. Rodney was in evening dress. It\\r\\nwas clear that his temper was ruffled.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s where youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been all the time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated, looking at\\r\\nKatharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve only been here about ten minutes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear Katharine, you left the drawing-room over an hour ago.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDoes it very much matter?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Henry asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nRodney found it hard to be unreasonable in the presence of another man,\\r\\nand did not answer him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t kind to old people to leave\\r\\nthem alone--although IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve no doubt itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s much more amusing to sit up here\\r\\nand talk to Henry.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe were discussing coal-mines,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Henry urbanely.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. But we were talking about much more interesting things before\\r\\nthat,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the apparent determination to hurt him with which she spoke, Henry\\r\\nthought that some sort of explosion on RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s part was about to take\\r\\nplace.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI can quite understand that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Rodney, with his little chuckle,\\r\\nleaning over the back of his chair and tapping the woodwork lightly\\r\\nwith his fingers. They were all silent, and the silence was acutely\\r\\nuncomfortable to Henry, at least.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWas it very dull, William?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine suddenly asked, with a complete\\r\\nchange of tone and a little gesture of her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf course it was dull,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William said sulkily.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, you stay and talk to Henry, and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll go down,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rose as she spoke, and as she turned to leave the room, she laid\\r\\nher hand, with a curiously caressing gesture, upon RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s shoulder.\\r\\nInstantly Rodney clasped her hand in his, with such an impulse of\\r\\nemotion that Henry was annoyed, and rather ostentatiously opened a book.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI shall come down with you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said William, as she drew back her hand,\\r\\nand made as if to pass him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh no,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said hastily. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou stay here and talk to Henry.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Henry, shutting up his book again. His invitation was\\r\\npolite, without being precisely cordial. Rodney evidently hesitated as\\r\\nto the course he should pursue, but seeing Katharine at the door, he\\r\\nexclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. I want to come with you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked back, and said in a very commanding tone, and with an\\r\\nexpression of authority upon her face:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s useless for you to come. I shall go to bed in ten minutes. Good\\r\\nnight.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe nodded to them both, but Henry could not help noticing that her last\\r\\nnod was in his direction. Rodney sat down rather heavily.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis mortification was so obvious that Henry scarcely liked to open the\\r\\nconversation with some remark of a literary character. On the other\\r\\nhand, unless he checked him, Rodney might begin to talk about his\\r\\nfeelings, and irreticence is apt to be extremely painful, at any rate in\\r\\nprospect. He therefore adopted a middle course; that is to say, he\\r\\nwrote a note upon the fly-leaf of his book, which ran, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe situation\\r\\nis becoming most uncomfortable.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d This he decorated with those flourishes\\r\\nand decorative borders which grow of themselves upon these occasions;\\r\\nand as he did so, he thought to himself that whatever KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndifficulties might be, they did not justify her behavior. She had spoken\\r\\nwith a kind of brutality which suggested that, whether it is natural or\\r\\nassumed, women have a peculiar blindness to the feelings of men.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe penciling of this note gave Rodney time to recover himself. Perhaps,\\r\\nfor he was a very vain man, he was more hurt that Henry had seen him\\r\\nrebuffed than by the rebuff itself. He was in love with Katharine,\\r\\nand vanity is not decreased but increased by love; especially, one may\\r\\nhazard, in the presence of oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s own sex. But Rodney enjoyed the courage\\r\\nwhich springs from that laughable and lovable defect, and when he had\\r\\nmastered his first impulse, in some way to make a fool of himself, he\\r\\ndrew inspiration from the perfect fit of his evening dress. He chose a\\r\\ncigarette, tapped it on the back of his hand, displayed his exquisite\\r\\npumps on the edge of the fender, and summoned his self-respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve several big estates round here, Otway,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he began. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAny good\\r\\nhunting? Let me see, what pack would it be? WhoÃ¢\\x80\\x99s your great man?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSir William Budge, the sugar king, has the biggest estate. He bought\\r\\nout poor Stanham, who went bankrupt.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich Stanham would that be? Verney or Alfred?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAlfred.... I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t hunt myself. YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re a great huntsman, arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you?\\r\\nYou have a great reputation as a horseman, anyhow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, desiring\\r\\nto help Rodney in his effort to recover his complacency.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, I love riding,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCould I get a horse down here?\\r\\nStupid of me! I forgot to bring any clothes. I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t imagine, though,\\r\\nwho told you I was anything of a rider?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTo tell the truth, Henry labored under the same difficulty; he did not\\r\\nwish to introduce KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s name, and, therefore, he replied vaguely\\r\\nthat he had always heard that Rodney was a great rider. In truth, he\\r\\nhad heard very little about him, one way or another, accepting him as\\r\\na figure often to be found in the background at his auntÃ¢\\x80\\x99s house, and\\r\\ninevitably, though inexplicably, engaged to his cousin.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t care much for shooting,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney continued; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut one has to do\\r\\nit, unless one wants to be altogether out of things. I dare say thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsome very pretty country round here. I stayed once at Bolham Hall. Young\\r\\nCranthorpe was up with you, wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t he? He married old Lord BolhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndaughter. Very nice people--in their way.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mix in that society,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Henry remarked, rather shortly. But\\r\\nRodney, now started on an agreeable current of reflection, could not\\r\\nresist the temptation of pursuing it a little further. He appeared to\\r\\nhimself as a man who moved easily in very good society, and knew enough\\r\\nabout the true values of life to be himself above it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, but you should,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he went on. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s well worth staying there,\\r\\nanyhow, once a year. They make one very comfortable, and the women are\\r\\nravishing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe women?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Henry thought to himself, with disgust. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat could any\\r\\nwoman see in you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d His tolerance was rapidly becoming exhausted, but\\r\\nhe could not help liking Rodney nevertheless, and this appeared to him\\r\\nstrange, for he was fastidious, and such words in another mouth would\\r\\nhave condemned the speaker irreparably. He began, in short, to wonder\\r\\nwhat kind of creature this man who was to marry his cousin might be.\\r\\nCould any one, except a rather singular character, afford to be so\\r\\nridiculously vain?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think I should get on in that society,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nthink I should know what to say to Lady Rose if I met her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t find any difficulty,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney chuckled. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou talk to them about\\r\\ntheir children, if they have any, or their accomplishments--painting,\\r\\ngardening, poetry--theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re so delightfully sympathetic. Seriously, you\\r\\nknow I think a womanÃ¢\\x80\\x99s opinion of oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s poetry is always worth having.\\r\\nDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t ask them for their reasons. Just ask them for their feelings.\\r\\nKatharine, for example--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Henry, with an emphasis upon the name, almost as if he\\r\\nresented RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s use of it, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine is very unlike most women.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cQuite,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney agreed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe is--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He seemed about to describe her, and\\r\\nhe hesitated for a long time. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s looking very well,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he stated, or\\r\\nrather almost inquired, in a different tone from that in which he had\\r\\nbeen speaking. Henry bent his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut, as a family, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re given to moods, eh?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Henry, with decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney repeated, as if he weighed the meaning of the\\r\\nwords. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo, perhaps youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re right. But her engagement has changed her.\\r\\nNaturally,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cone would expect that to be so.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He waited for\\r\\nHenry to confirm this statement, but Henry remained silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine has had a difficult life, in some ways,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he continued. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nexpect that marriage will be good for her. She has great powers.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGreat,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Henry, with decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes--but now what direction dÃ¢\\x80\\x99you think they take?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRodney had completely dropped his pose as a man of the world, and seemed\\r\\nto be asking Henry to help him in a difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Henry hesitated cautiously.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDÃ¢\\x80\\x99you think children--a household--that sort of thing--dÃ¢\\x80\\x99you think\\r\\nthatÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll satisfy her? Mind, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m out all day.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe would certainly be very competent,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Henry stated.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s wonderfully competent,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Rodney. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut--I get absorbed in\\r\\nmy poetry. Well, Katharine hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t got that. She admires my poetry, you\\r\\nknow, but that wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be enough for her?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Henry. He paused. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, as if he\\r\\nwere summing up his thoughts. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t found herself yet. Life\\r\\nisnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t altogether real to her yet--I sometimes think--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney inquired, as if he were eager for Henry to continue. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThat\\r\\nis what I--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he was going on, as Henry remained silent, but the sentence\\r\\nwas not finished, for the door opened, and they were interrupted by\\r\\nHenryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s younger brother Gilbert, much to HenryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s relief, for he had\\r\\nalready said more than he liked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the sun shone, as it did with unusual brightness that Christmas\\r\\nweek, it revealed much that was faded and not altogether well-kept-up\\r\\nin Stogdon House and its grounds. In truth, Sir Francis had retired\\r\\nfrom service under the Government of India with a pension that was\\r\\nnot adequate, in his opinion, to his services, as it certainly was\\r\\nnot adequate to his ambitions. His career had not come up to his\\r\\nexpectations, and although he was a very fine, white-whiskered,\\r\\nmahogany-colored old man to look at, and had laid down a very choice\\r\\ncellar of good reading and good stories, you could not long remain\\r\\nignorant of the fact that some thunder-storm had soured them; he had\\r\\na grievance. This grievance dated back to the middle years of the last\\r\\ncentury, when, owing to some official intrigue, his merits had been\\r\\npassed over in a disgraceful manner in favor of another, his junior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rights and wrongs of the story, presuming that they had some\\r\\nexistence in fact, were no longer clearly known to his wife and\\r\\nchildren; but this disappointment had played a very large part in their\\r\\nlives, and had poisoned the life of Sir Francis much as a disappointment\\r\\nin love is said to poison the whole life of a woman. Long brooding on\\r\\nhis failure, continual arrangement and rearrangement of his deserts and\\r\\nrebuffs, had made Sir Francis much of an egoist, and in his retirement\\r\\nhis temper became increasingly difficult and exacting.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife now offered so little resistance to his moods that she was\\r\\npractically useless to him. He made his daughter Eleanor into his chief\\r\\nconfidante, and the prime of her life was being rapidly consumed by her\\r\\nfather. To her he dictated the memoirs which were to avenge his memory,\\r\\nand she had to assure him constantly that his treatment had been a\\r\\ndisgrace. Already, at the age of thirty-five, her cheeks were whitening\\r\\nas her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s had whitened, but for her there would be no memories of\\r\\nIndian suns and Indian rivers, and clamor of children in a nursery; she\\r\\nwould have very little of substance to think about when she sat, as\\r\\nLady Otway now sat, knitting white wool, with her eyes fixed almost\\r\\nperpetually upon the same embroidered bird upon the same fire-screen.\\r\\nBut then Lady Otway was one of the people for whom the great\\r\\nmake-believe game of English social life has been invented; she spent\\r\\nmost of her time in pretending to herself and her neighbors that she\\r\\nwas a dignified, important, much-occupied person, of considerable social\\r\\nstanding and sufficient wealth. In view of the actual state of things\\r\\nthis game needed a great deal of skill; and, perhaps, at the age she had\\r\\nreached--she was over sixty--she played far more to deceive herself\\r\\nthan to deceive any one else. Moreover, the armor was wearing thin; she\\r\\nforgot to keep up appearances more and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worn patches in the carpets, and the pallor of the drawing-room,\\r\\nwhere no chair or cover had been renewed for some years, were due\\r\\nnot only to the miserable pension, but to the wear and tear of twelve\\r\\nchildren, eight of whom were sons. As often happens in these large\\r\\nfamilies, a distinct dividing-line could be traced, about half-way in\\r\\nthe succession, where the money for educational purposes had run short,\\r\\nand the six younger children had grown up far more economically than\\r\\nthe elder. If the boys were clever, they won scholarships, and went to\\r\\nschool; if they were not clever, they took what the family connection\\r\\nhad to offer them. The girls accepted situations occasionally, but there\\r\\nwere always one or two at home, nursing sick animals, tending silkworms,\\r\\nor playing the flute in their bedrooms. The distinction between the\\r\\nelder children and the younger corresponded almost to the distinction\\r\\nbetween a higher class and a lower one, for with only a haphazard\\r\\neducation and insufficient allowances, the younger children had picked\\r\\nup accomplishments, friends, and points of view which were not to be\\r\\nfound within the walls of a public school or of a Government office.\\r\\nBetween the two divisions there was considerable hostility, the elder\\r\\ntrying to patronize the younger, the younger refusing to respect the\\r\\nelder; but one feeling united them and instantly closed any risk of a\\r\\nbreach--their common belief in the superiority of their own family to\\r\\nall others. Henry was the eldest of the younger group, and their leader;\\r\\nhe bought strange books and joined odd societies; he went without a tie\\r\\nfor a whole year, and had six shirts made of black flannel. He had\\r\\nlong refused to take a seat either in a shipping office or in a\\r\\ntea-merchantÃ¢\\x80\\x99s warehouse; and persisted, in spite of the disapproval of\\r\\nuncles and aunts, in practicing both violin and piano, with the result\\r\\nthat he could not perform professionally upon either. Indeed, for\\r\\nthirty-two years of life he had nothing more substantial to show than a\\r\\nmanuscript book containing the score of half an opera. In this protest\\r\\nof his, Katharine had always given him her support, and as she was\\r\\ngenerally held to be an extremely sensible person, who dressed too well\\r\\nto be eccentric, he had found her support of some use. Indeed, when she\\r\\ncame down at Christmas she usually spent a great part of her time in\\r\\nprivate conferences with Henry and with Cassandra, the youngest girl,\\r\\nto whom the silkworms belonged. With the younger section she had a great\\r\\nreputation for common sense, and for something that they despised but\\r\\ninwardly respected and called knowledge of the world--that is to say,\\r\\nof the way in which respectable elderly people, going to their clubs\\r\\nand dining out with ministers, think and behave. She had more than once\\r\\nplayed the part of ambassador between Lady Otway and her children. That\\r\\npoor lady, for instance, consulted her for advice when, one day, she\\r\\nopened CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s bedroom door on a mission of discovery, and found the\\r\\nceiling hung with mulberry-leaves, the windows blocked with cages, and\\r\\nthe tables stacked with home-made machines for the manufacture of silk\\r\\ndresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wish you could help her to take an interest in something that other\\r\\npeople are interested in, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she observed, rather plaintively,\\r\\ndetailing her grievances. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all HenryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s doing, you know, giving up\\r\\nher parties and taking to these nasty insects. It doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t follow that if\\r\\na man can do a thing a woman may too.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning was sufficiently bright to make the chairs and sofas in Lady\\r\\nOtwayÃ¢\\x80\\x99s private sitting-room appear more than usually shabby, and the\\r\\ngallant gentlemen, her brothers and cousins, who had defended the Empire\\r\\nand left their bones on many frontiers, looked at the world through a\\r\\nfilm of yellow which the morning light seemed to have drawn across\\r\\ntheir photographs. Lady Otway sighed, it may be at the faded relics,\\r\\nand turned, with resignation, to her balls of wool, which, curiously\\r\\nand characteristically, were not an ivory-white, but rather a tarnished\\r\\nyellow-white. She had called her niece in for a little chat. She had\\r\\nalways trusted her, and now more than ever, since her engagement to\\r\\nRodney, which seemed to Lady Otway extremely suitable, and just what one\\r\\nwould wish for oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s own daughter. Katharine unwittingly increased her\\r\\nreputation for wisdom by asking to be given knitting-needles too.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s so very pleasant,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Lady Otway, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto knit while oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s talking.\\r\\nAnd now, my dear Katharine, tell me about your plans.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe emotions of the night before, which she had suppressed in such a way\\r\\nas to keep her awake till dawn, had left Katharine a little jaded, and\\r\\nthus more matter-of-fact than usual. She was quite ready to discuss her\\r\\nplans--houses and rents, servants and economy--without feeling that they\\r\\nconcerned her very much. As she spoke, knitting methodically meanwhile,\\r\\nLady Otway noted, with approval, the upright, responsible bearing of her\\r\\nniece, to whom the prospect of marriage had brought some gravity most\\r\\nbecoming in a bride, and yet, in these days, most rare. Yes, KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nengagement had changed her a little.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat a perfect daughter, or daughter-in-law!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought to herself,\\r\\nand could not help contrasting her with Cassandra, surrounded by\\r\\ninnumerable silkworms in her bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued, glancing at Katharine, with the round, greenish\\r\\neyes which were as inexpressive as moist marbles, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine is like the\\r\\ngirls of my youth. We took the serious things of life seriously.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n But just as she was deriving satisfaction from this thought, and was\\r\\nproducing some of the hoarded wisdom which none of her own daughters,\\r\\nalas! seemed now to need, the door opened, and Mrs. Hilbery came in,\\r\\nor rather, did not come in, but stood in the doorway and smiled, having\\r\\nevidently mistaken the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI never SHALL know my way about this house!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m on\\r\\nmy way to the library, and I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to interrupt. You and Katharine\\r\\nwere having a little chat?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presence of her sister-in-law made Lady Otway slightly uneasy. How\\r\\ncould she go on with what she was saying in MaggieÃ¢\\x80\\x99s presence? for she\\r\\nwas saying something that she had never said, all these years, to Maggie\\r\\nherself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI was telling Katharine a few little commonplaces about marriage,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nsaid, with a little laugh. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAre none of my children looking after you,\\r\\nMaggie?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMarriage,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Hilbery, coming into the room, and nodding her\\r\\nhead once or twice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI always say marriage is a school. And you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nget the prizes unless you go to school. Charlotte has won all the\\r\\nprizes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, giving her sister-in-law a little pat, which\\r\\nmade Lady Otway more uncomfortable still. She half laughed, muttered\\r\\nsomething, and ended on a sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAunt Charlotte was saying that itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no good being married unless you\\r\\nsubmit to your husband,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, framing her auntÃ¢\\x80\\x99s words into\\r\\na far more definite shape than they had really worn; and when she spoke\\r\\nthus she did not appear at all old-fashioned. Lady Otway looked at her\\r\\nand paused for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, I really donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t advise a woman who wants to have things her own\\r\\nway to get married,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, beginning a fresh row rather elaborately.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery knew something of the circumstances which, as she thought,\\r\\nhad inspired this remark. In a moment her face was clouded with sympathy\\r\\nwhich she did not quite know how to express.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat a shame it was!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed, forgetting that her train of\\r\\nthought might not be obvious to her listeners. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut, Charlotte, it would\\r\\nhave been much worse if Frank had disgraced himself in any way. And it\\r\\nisnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t what our husbands GET, but what they ARE. I used to dream of white\\r\\nhorses and palanquins, too; but still, I like the ink-pots best. And who\\r\\nknows?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she concluded, looking at Katharine, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyour father may be made a\\r\\nbaronet to-morrow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Otway, who was Mr. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sister, knew quite well that, in\\r\\nprivate, the Hilberys called Sir Francis Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat old Turk,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and though\\r\\nshe did not follow the drift of Mrs. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s remarks, she knew what\\r\\nprompted them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut if you can give way to your husband,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, speaking to\\r\\nKatharine, as if there were a separate understanding between them, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ca\\r\\nhappy marriage is the happiest thing in the world.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She did not mean to finish her sentence,\\r\\nshe merely wished to induce her mother and her aunt to go on talking\\r\\nabout marriage, for she was in the mood to feel that other people could\\r\\nhelp her if they would. She went on knitting, but her fingers worked\\r\\nwith a decision that was oddly unlike the smooth and contemplative\\r\\nsweep of Lady OtwayÃ¢\\x80\\x99s plump hand. Now and then she looked swiftly at her\\r\\nmother, then at her aunt. Mrs. Hilbery held a book in her hand, and\\r\\nwas on her way, as Katharine guessed, to the library, where another\\r\\nparagraph was to be added to that varied assortment of paragraphs, the\\r\\nLife of Richard Alardyce. Normally, Katharine would have hurried her\\r\\nmother downstairs, and seen that no excuse for distraction came her way.\\r\\nHer attitude towards the poetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s life, however, had changed with other\\r\\nchanges; and she was content to forget all about her scheme of hours.\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery was secretly delighted. Her relief at finding herself\\r\\nexcused manifested itself in a series of sidelong glances of sly humor\\r\\nin her daughterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s direction, and the indulgence put her in the best of\\r\\nspirits. Was she to be allowed merely to sit and talk? It was so much\\r\\npleasanter to sit in a nice room filled with all sorts of interesting\\r\\nodds and ends which she hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t looked at for a year, at least, than to\\r\\nseek out one date which contradicted another in a dictionary.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWeÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve all had perfect husbands,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she concluded, generously forgiving\\r\\nSir Francis all his faults in a lump. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot that I think a bad temper\\r\\nis really a fault in a man. I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mean a bad temper,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she corrected\\r\\nherself, with a glance obviously in the direction of Sir Francis. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nshould say a quick, impatient temper. Most, in fact ALL great men have\\r\\nhad bad tempers--except your grandfather, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and here she\\r\\nsighed, and suggested that, perhaps, she ought to go down to the\\r\\nlibrary.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut in the ordinary marriage, is it necessary to give way to oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhusband?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, taking no notice of her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s suggestion,\\r\\nblind even to the depression which had now taken possession of her at\\r\\nthe thought of her own inevitable death.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should say yes, certainly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Lady Otway, with a decision most\\r\\nunusual for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen one ought to make up oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mind to that before one is married,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Katharine mused, seeming to address herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery was not much interested in these remarks, which seemed to\\r\\nhave a melancholy tendency, and to revive her spirits she had recourse\\r\\nto an infallible remedy--she looked out of the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo look at that lovely little blue bird!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed, and her eye\\r\\nlooked with extreme pleasure at the soft sky. at the trees, at the green\\r\\nfields visible behind those trees, and at the leafless branches which\\r\\nsurrounded the body of the small blue tit. Her sympathy with nature was\\r\\nexquisite.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMost women know by instinct whether they can give it or not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Lady\\r\\nOtway slipped in quickly, in rather a low voice, as if she wanted to\\r\\nget this said while her sister-in-lawÃ¢\\x80\\x99s attention was diverted. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd if\\r\\nnot--well then, my advice would be--donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t marry.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, but marriage is the happiest life for a woman,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Hilbery,\\r\\ncatching the word marriage, as she brought her eyes back to the room\\r\\nagain. Then she turned her mind to what she had said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the most INTERESTING life,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she corrected herself. She looked at\\r\\nher daughter with a look of vague alarm. It was the kind of maternal\\r\\nscrutiny which suggests that, in looking at her daughter a mother is\\r\\nreally looking at herself. She was not altogether satisfied; but she\\r\\npurposely made no attempt to break down the reserve which, as a matter\\r\\nof fact, was a quality she particularly admired and depended upon in\\r\\nher daughter. But when her mother said that marriage was the most\\r\\ninteresting life, Katharine felt, as she was apt to do suddenly, for no\\r\\ndefinite reason, that they understood each other, in spite of differing\\r\\nin every possible way. Yet the wisdom of the old seems to apply more to\\r\\nfeelings which we have in common with the rest of the human race than\\r\\nto our feelings as individuals, and Katharine knew that only some one of\\r\\nher own age could follow her meaning. Both these elderly women seemed to\\r\\nher to have been content with so little happiness, and at the moment she\\r\\nhad not sufficient force to feel certain that their version of marriage\\r\\nwas the wrong one. In London, certainly, this temperate attitude toward\\r\\nher own marriage had seemed to her just. Why had she now changed? Why\\r\\ndid it now depress her? It never occurred to her that her own conduct\\r\\ncould be anything of a puzzle to her mother, or that elder people are as\\r\\nmuch affected by the young as the young are by them. And yet it was true\\r\\nthat love--passion--whatever one chose to call it, had played far less\\r\\npart in Mrs. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s life than might have seemed likely, judging from\\r\\nher enthusiastic and imaginative temperament. She had always been\\r\\nmore interested by other things. Lady Otway, strange though it seemed,\\r\\nguessed more accurately at KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s state of mind than her mother\\r\\ndid.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t we all live in the country?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery, once\\r\\nmore looking out of the window. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure one would think such beautiful\\r\\nthings if one lived in the country. No horrid slum houses to depress\\r\\none, no trams or motor-cars; and the people all looking so plump and\\r\\ncheerful. IsnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t there some little cottage near you, Charlotte, which\\r\\nwould do for us, with a spare room, perhaps, in case we asked a friend\\r\\ndown? And we should save so much money that we should be able to\\r\\ntravel--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. You would find it very nice for a week or two, no doubt,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nLady Otway. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut what hour would you like the carriage this morning?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she continued, touching the bell.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine shall decide,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Hilbery, feeling herself unable\\r\\nto prefer one hour to another. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd I was just going to tell you,\\r\\nKatharine, how, when I woke this morning, everything seemed so clear in\\r\\nmy head that if IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d had a pencil I believe I could have written quite a\\r\\nlong chapter. When weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re out on our drive I shall find us a house. A few\\r\\ntrees round it, and a little garden, a pond with a Chinese duck, a\\r\\nstudy for your father, a study for me, and a sitting room for Katharine,\\r\\nbecause then sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be a married lady.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this Katharine shivered a little, drew up to the fire, and warmed her\\r\\nhands by spreading them over the topmost peak of the coal. She wished to\\r\\nbring the talk back to marriage again, in order to hear Aunt CharlotteÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nviews, but she did not know how to do this.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLet me look at your engagement-ring, Aunt Charlotte,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said,\\r\\nnoticing her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took the cluster of green stones and turned it round and round, but\\r\\nshe did not know what to say next.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat poor old ring was a sad disappointment to me when I first had it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Lady Otway mused. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99d set my heart on a diamond ring, but I never liked\\r\\nto tell Frank, naturally. He bought it at Simla.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine turned the ring round once more, and gave it back to her aunt\\r\\nwithout speaking. And while she turned it round her lips set themselves\\r\\nfirmly together, and it seemed to her that she could satisfy William\\r\\nas these women had satisfied their husbands; she could pretend to like\\r\\nemeralds when she preferred diamonds. Having replaced her ring, Lady\\r\\nOtway remarked that it was chilly, though not more so than one must\\r\\nexpect at this time of year. Indeed, one ought to be thankful to see the\\r\\nsun at all, and she advised them both to dress warmly for their drive.\\r\\nHer auntÃ¢\\x80\\x99s stock of commonplaces, Katharine sometimes suspected, had\\r\\nbeen laid in on purpose to fill silences with, and had little to do with\\r\\nher private thoughts. But at this moment they seemed terribly in keeping\\r\\nwith her own conclusions, so that she took up her knitting again and\\r\\nlistened, chiefly with a view to confirming herself in the belief that\\r\\nto be engaged to marry some one with whom you are not in love is an\\r\\ninevitable step in a world where the existence of passion is only a\\r\\ntravellerÃ¢\\x80\\x99s story brought from the heart of deep forests and told so\\r\\nrarely that wise people doubt whether the story can be true. She did her\\r\\nbest to listen to her mother asking for news of John, and to her aunt\\r\\nreplying with the authentic history of HildaÃ¢\\x80\\x99s engagement to an officer\\r\\nin the Indian Army, but she cast her mind alternately towards forest\\r\\npaths and starry blossoms, and towards pages of neatly written\\r\\nmathematical signs. When her mind took this turn her marriage seemed no\\r\\nmore than an archway through which it was necessary to pass in order to\\r\\nhave her desire. At such times the current of her nature ran in its\\r\\ndeep narrow channel with great force and with an alarming lack of\\r\\nconsideration for the feelings of others. Just as the two elder ladies\\r\\nhad finished their survey of the family prospects, and Lady Otway was\\r\\nnervously anticipating some general statement as to life and death from\\r\\nher sister-in-law, Cassandra burst into the room with the news that the\\r\\ncarriage was at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t Andrews tell me himself?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Lady Otway, peevishly,\\r\\nblaming her servants for not living up to her ideals.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mrs. Hilbery and Katharine arrived in the hall, ready dressed for\\r\\ntheir drive, they found that the usual discussion was going forward as\\r\\nto the plans of the rest of the family. In token of this, a great many\\r\\ndoors were opening and shutting, two or three people stood irresolutely\\r\\non the stairs, now going a few steps up, and now a few steps down, and\\r\\nSir Francis himself had come out from his study, with the Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTimesÃ¢\\x80\\x9d under\\r\\nhis arm, and a complaint about noise and draughts from the open door\\r\\nwhich, at least, had the effect of bundling the people who did not want\\r\\nto go into the carriage, and sending those who did not want to stay back\\r\\nto their rooms. It was decided that Mrs. Hilbery, Katharine, Rodney, and\\r\\nHenry should drive to Lincoln, and any one else who wished to go should\\r\\nfollow on bicycles or in the pony-cart. Every one who stayed at Stogdon\\r\\nHouse had to make this expedition to Lincoln in obedience to Lady\\r\\nOtwayÃ¢\\x80\\x99s conception of the right way to entertain her guests, which\\r\\nshe had imbibed from reading in fashionable papers of the behavior of\\r\\nChristmas parties in ducal houses. The carriage horses were both fat and\\r\\naged, still they matched; the carriage was shaky and uncomfortable,\\r\\nbut the Otway arms were visible on the panels. Lady Otway stood on\\r\\nthe topmost step, wrapped in a white shawl, and waved her hand almost\\r\\nmechanically until they had turned the corner under the laurel-bushes,\\r\\nwhen she retired indoors with a sense that she had played her part, and\\r\\na sigh at the thought that none of her children felt it necessary to\\r\\nplay theirs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carriage bowled along smoothly over the gently curving road. Mrs.\\r\\nHilbery dropped into a pleasant, inattentive state of mind, in which she\\r\\nwas conscious of the running green lines of the hedges, of the swelling\\r\\nploughland, and of the mild blue sky, which served her, after the first\\r\\nfive minutes, for a pastoral background to the drama of human life; and\\r\\nthen she thought of a cottage garden, with the flash of yellow daffodils\\r\\nagainst blue water; and what with the arrangement of these different\\r\\nprospects, and the shaping of two or three lovely phrases, she did not\\r\\nnotice that the young people in the carriage were almost silent. Henry,\\r\\nindeed, had been included against his wish, and revenged himself by\\r\\nobserving Katharine and Rodney with disillusioned eyes; while Katharine\\r\\nwas in a state of gloomy self-suppression which resulted in complete\\r\\napathy. When Rodney spoke to her she either said Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHum!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d or assented\\r\\nso listlessly that he addressed his next remark to her mother. His\\r\\ndeference was agreeable to her, his manners were exemplary; and when\\r\\nthe church towers and factory chimneys of the town came into sight, she\\r\\nroused herself, and recalled memories of the fair summer of 1853, which\\r\\nfitted in harmoniously with what she was dreaming of the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nBut other passengers were approaching Lincoln meanwhile by other roads\\r\\non foot. A county town draws the inhabitants of all vicarages, farms,\\r\\ncountry houses, and wayside cottages, within a radius of ten miles at\\r\\nleast, once or twice a week to its streets; and among them, on this\\r\\noccasion, were Ralph Denham and Mary Datchet. They despised the roads,\\r\\nand took their way across the fields; and yet, from their appearance, it\\r\\ndid not seem as if they cared much where they walked so long as the way\\r\\ndid not actually trip them up. When they left the Vicarage, they had\\r\\nbegun an argument which swung their feet along so rhythmically in time\\r\\nwith it that they covered the ground at over four miles an hour, and saw\\r\\nnothing of the hedgerows, the swelling plowland, or the mild blue sky.\\r\\nWhat they saw were the Houses of Parliament and the Government Offices\\r\\nin Whitehall. They both belonged to the class which is conscious of\\r\\nhaving lost its birthright in these great structures and is seeking to\\r\\nbuild another kind of lodging for its own notion of law and government.\\r\\nPurposely, perhaps, Mary did not agree with Ralph; she loved to feel her\\r\\nmind in conflict with his, and to be certain that he spared her female\\r\\njudgment no ounce of his male muscularity. He seemed to argue as\\r\\nfiercely with her as if she were his brother. They were alike, however,\\r\\nin believing that it behooved them to take in hand the repair and\\r\\nreconstruction of the fabric of England. They agreed in thinking that\\r\\nnature has not been generous in the endowment of our councilors. They\\r\\nagreed, unconsciously, in a mute love for the muddy field through which\\r\\nthey tramped, with eyes narrowed close by the concentration of their\\r\\nminds. At length they drew breath, let the argument fly away into the\\r\\nlimbo of other good arguments, and, leaning over a gate, opened their\\r\\neyes for the first time and looked about them. Their feet tingled\\r\\nwith warm blood and their breath rose in steam around them. The bodily\\r\\nexercise made them both feel more direct and less self-conscious than\\r\\nusual, and Mary, indeed, was overcome by a sort of light-headedness\\r\\nwhich made it seem to her that it mattered very little what happened\\r\\nnext. It mattered so little, indeed, that she felt herself on the point\\r\\nof saying to Ralph:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI love you; I shall never love anybody else. Marry me or leave me;\\r\\nthink what you like of me--I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t care a straw.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d At the moment,\\r\\nhowever, speech or silence seemed immaterial, and she merely clapped her\\r\\nhands together, and looked at the distant woods with the rust-like bloom\\r\\non their brown, and the green and blue landscape through the steam of\\r\\nher own breath. It seemed a mere toss-up whether she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI love you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n or whether she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI love the beech-trees,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d or only Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI love--I love.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you know, Mary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph suddenly interrupted her, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve made up my\\r\\nmind.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer indifference must have been superficial, for it disappeared at\\r\\nonce. Indeed, she lost sight of the trees, and saw her own hand upon the\\r\\ntopmost bar of the gate with extreme distinctness, while he went on:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve made up my mind to chuck my work and live down here. I want you to\\r\\ntell me about that cottage you spoke of. However, I suppose thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nbe no difficulty about getting a cottage, will there?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He spoke with an\\r\\nassumption of carelessness as if expecting her to dissuade him.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe still waited, as if for him to continue; she was convinced that in\\r\\nsome roundabout way he approached the subject of their marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t stand the office any longer,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he proceeded. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know what\\r\\nmy family will say; but IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m right. DonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you think so?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLive down here by yourself?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSome old woman would do for me, I suppose,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sick of\\r\\nthe whole thing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he went on, and opened the gate with a jerk. They\\r\\nbegan to cross the next field walking side by side.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI tell you, Mary, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s utter destruction, working away, day after day,\\r\\nat stuff that doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t matter a damn to any one. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve stood eight years\\r\\nof it, and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not going to stand it any longer. I suppose this all\\r\\nseems to you mad, though?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time Mary had recovered her self-control.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. I thought you werenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t happy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy did you think that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked, with some surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you remember that morning in LincolnÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Inn Fields?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph, slackening his pace and remembering Katharine and\\r\\nher engagement, the purple leaves stamped into the path, the white paper\\r\\nradiant under the electric light, and the hopelessness which seemed to\\r\\nsurround all these things.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re right, Mary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, with something of an effort, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthough I\\r\\ndonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know how you guessed it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was silent, hoping that he might tell her the reason of his\\r\\nunhappiness, for his excuses had not deceived her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI was unhappy--very unhappy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated. Some six weeks separated\\r\\nhim from that afternoon when he had sat upon the Embankment watching his\\r\\nvisions dissolve in mist as the waters swam past and the sense of his\\r\\ndesolation still made him shiver. He had not recovered in the least from\\r\\nthat depression. Here was an opportunity for making himself face it,\\r\\nas he felt that he ought to; for, by this time, no doubt, it was only a\\r\\nsentimental ghost, better exorcised by ruthless exposure to such an eye\\r\\nas MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s, than allowed to underlie all his actions and thoughts as had\\r\\nbeen the case ever since he first saw Katharine Hilbery pouring out tea.\\r\\nHe must begin, however, by mentioning her name, and this he found it\\r\\nimpossible to do. He persuaded himself that he could make an honest\\r\\nstatement without speaking her name; he persuaded himself that his\\r\\nfeeling had very little to do with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUnhappiness is a state of mind,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cby which I mean that it is\\r\\nnot necessarily the result of any particular cause.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis rather stilted beginning did not please him, and it became more\\r\\nand more obvious to him that, whatever he might say, his unhappiness had\\r\\nbeen directly caused by Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI began to find my life unsatisfactory,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he started afresh. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt seemed\\r\\nto me meaningless.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He paused again, but felt that this, at any rate,\\r\\nwas true, and that on these lines he could go on.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAll this money-making and working ten hours a day in an office, whatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nit FOR? When oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a boy, you see, oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s head is so full of dreams that\\r\\nit doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t seem to matter what one does. And if youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re ambitious, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re\\r\\nall right; youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got a reason for going on. Now my reasons ceased to\\r\\nsatisfy me. Perhaps I never had any. ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s very likely now I come to\\r\\nthink of it. (What reason is there for anything, though?) Still, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nimpossible, after a certain age, to take oneself in satisfactorily. And\\r\\nI know what carried me onÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--for a good reason now occurred to him--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nwanted to be the savior of my family and all that kind of thing. I\\r\\nwanted them to get on in the world. That was a lie, of course--a kind of\\r\\nself-glorification, too. Like most people, I suppose, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve lived almost\\r\\nentirely among delusions, and now IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m at the awkward stage of finding it\\r\\nout. I want another delusion to go on with. ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what my unhappiness\\r\\namounts to, Mary.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two reasons that kept Mary very silent during this speech,\\r\\nand drew curiously straight lines upon her face. In the first place,\\r\\nRalph made no mention of marriage; in the second, he was not speaking\\r\\nthe truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think it will be difficult to find a cottage,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, with\\r\\ncheerful hardness, ignoring the whole of this statement. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got\\r\\na little money, havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you? Yes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she concluded, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see why it\\r\\nshouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be a very good plan.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey crossed the field in complete silence. Ralph was surprised by her\\r\\nremark and a little hurt, and yet, on the whole, rather pleased. He\\r\\nhad convinced himself that it was impossible to lay his case truthfully\\r\\nbefore Mary, and, secretly, he was relieved to find that he had not\\r\\nparted with his dream to her. She was, as he had always found her, the\\r\\nsensible, loyal friend, the woman he trusted; whose sympathy he\\r\\ncould count upon, provided he kept within certain limits. He was not\\r\\ndispleased to find that those limits were very clearly marked. When they\\r\\nhad crossed the next hedge she said to him:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, Ralph, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s time you made a break. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve come to the same\\r\\nconclusion myself. Only it wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be a country cottage in my case; itÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nbe America. America!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she cried. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the place for me! TheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll teach\\r\\nme something about organizing a movement there, and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll come back and\\r\\nshow you how to do it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIf she meant consciously or unconsciously to belittle the seclusion\\r\\nand security of a country cottage, she did not succeed; for RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndetermination was genuine. But she made him visualize her in her own\\r\\ncharacter, so that he looked quickly at her, as she walked a little in\\r\\nfront of him across the plowed field; for the first time that morning he\\r\\nsaw her independently of him or of his preoccupation with Katharine.\\r\\nHe seemed to see her marching ahead, a rather clumsy but powerful and\\r\\nindependent figure, for whose courage he felt the greatest respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t go away, Mary!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed, and stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what you said before, Ralph,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she returned, without looking at\\r\\nhim. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou want to go away yourself and you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want me to go away.\\r\\nThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not very sensible, is it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he cried, stung by the remembrance of his exacting and\\r\\ndictatorial ways with her, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat a brute IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been to you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took all her strength to keep the tears from springing, and to thrust\\r\\nback her assurance that she would forgive him till Doomsday if he chose.\\r\\nShe was preserved from doing so only by a stubborn kind of respect for\\r\\nherself which lay at the root of her nature and forbade surrender, even\\r\\nin moments of almost overwhelming passion. Now, when all was tempest and\\r\\nhigh-running waves, she knew of a land where the sun shone clear upon\\r\\nItalian grammars and files of docketed papers. Nevertheless, from the\\r\\nskeleton pallor of that land and the rocks that broke its surface,\\r\\nshe knew that her life there would be harsh and lonely almost beyond\\r\\nendurance. She walked steadily a little in front of him across the\\r\\nplowed field. Their way took them round the verge of a wood of thin\\r\\ntrees standing at the edge of a steep fold in the land. Looking between\\r\\nthe tree-trunks, Ralph saw laid out on the perfectly flat and richly\\r\\ngreen meadow at the bottom of the hill a small gray manor-house, with\\r\\nponds, terraces, and clipped hedges in front of it, a farm building or\\r\\nso at the side, and a screen of fir-trees rising behind, all perfectly\\r\\nsheltered and self-sufficient. Behind the house the hill rose again,\\r\\nand the trees on the farther summit stood upright against the sky, which\\r\\nappeared of a more intense blue between their trunks. His mind at once\\r\\nwas filled with a sense of the actual presence of Katharine; the gray\\r\\nhouse and the intense blue sky gave him the feeling of her presence\\r\\nclose by. He leant against a tree, forming her name beneath his breath:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said aloud, and then, looking round, saw Mary\\r\\nwalking slowly away from him, tearing a long spray of ivy from the trees\\r\\nas she passed them. She seemed so definitely opposed to the vision he\\r\\nheld in his mind that he returned to it with a gesture of impatience.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated, and seemed to himself to be with\\r\\nher. He lost his sense of all that surrounded him; all substantial\\r\\nthings--the hour of the day, what we have done and are about to do, the\\r\\npresence of other people and the support we derive from seeing their\\r\\nbelief in a common reality--all this slipped from him. So he might have\\r\\nfelt if the earth had dropped from his feet, and the empty blue had\\r\\nhung all round him, and the air had been steeped in the presence of one\\r\\nwoman. The chirp of a robin on the bough above his head awakened him,\\r\\nand his awakenment was accompanied by a sigh. Here was the world in\\r\\nwhich he had lived; here the plowed field, the high road yonder, and\\r\\nMary, stripping ivy from the trees. When he came up with her he linked\\r\\nhis arm through hers and said:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Mary, whatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all this about America?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a brotherly kindness in his voice which seemed to her\\r\\nmagnanimous, when she reflected that she had cut short his explanations\\r\\nand shown little interest in his change of plan. She gave him her\\r\\nreasons for thinking that she might profit by such a journey, omitting\\r\\nthe one reason which had set all the rest in motion. He listened\\r\\nattentively, and made no attempt to dissuade her. In truth, he found\\r\\nhimself curiously eager to make certain of her good sense, and accepted\\r\\neach fresh proof of it with satisfaction, as though it helped him to\\r\\nmake up his mind about something. She forgot the pain he had caused her,\\r\\nand in place of it she became conscious of a steady tide of well-being\\r\\nwhich harmonized very aptly with the tramp of their feet upon the dry\\r\\nroad and the support of his arm. The comfort was the more glowing in\\r\\nthat it seemed to be the reward of her determination to behave to him\\r\\nsimply and without attempting to be other than she was. Instead of\\r\\nmaking out an interest in the poets, she avoided them instinctively, and\\r\\ndwelt rather insistently upon the practical nature of her gifts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a practical way she asked for particulars of his cottage, which\\r\\nhardly existed in his mind, and corrected his vagueness.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou must see that thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s water,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she insisted, with an exaggeration\\r\\nof interest. She avoided asking him what he meant to do in this cottage,\\r\\nand, at last, when all the practical details had been thrashed out as\\r\\nmuch as possible, he rewarded her by a more intimate statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOne of the rooms,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmust be my study, for, you see, Mary,\\r\\nIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m going to write a book.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Here he withdrew his arm from hers, lit his\\r\\npipe, and they tramped on in a sagacious kind of comradeship, the most\\r\\ncomplete they had attained in all their friendship.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd whatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s your book to be about?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, as boldly as if she had\\r\\nnever come to grief with Ralph in talking about books. He told her\\r\\nunhesitatingly that he meant to write the history of the English village\\r\\nfrom Saxon days to the present time. Some such plan had lain as a seed\\r\\nin his mind for many years; and now that he had decided, in a flash,\\r\\nto give up his profession, the seed grew in the space of twenty minutes\\r\\nboth tall and lusty. He was surprised himself at the positive way in\\r\\nwhich he spoke. It was the same with the question of his cottage. That\\r\\nhad come into existence, too, in an unromantic shape--a square white\\r\\nhouse standing just off the high road, no doubt, with a neighbor who\\r\\nkept a pig and a dozen squalling children; for these plans were shorn\\r\\nof all romance in his mind, and the pleasure he derived from thinking\\r\\nof them was checked directly it passed a very sober limit. So a sensible\\r\\nman who has lost his chance of some beautiful inheritance might tread\\r\\nout the narrow bounds of his actual dwelling-place, and assure himself\\r\\nthat life is supportable within its demesne, only one must grow turnips\\r\\nand cabbages, not melons and pomegranates. Certainly Ralph took some\\r\\npride in the resources of his mind, and was insensibly helped to right\\r\\nhimself by MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s trust in him. She wound her ivy spray round her\\r\\nash-plant, and for the first time for many days, when alone with Ralph,\\r\\nset no spies upon her motives, sayings, and feelings, but surrendered\\r\\nherself to complete happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus talking, with easy silences and some pauses to look at the view\\r\\nover the hedge and to decide upon the species of a little gray-brown\\r\\nbird slipping among the twigs, they walked into Lincoln, and after\\r\\nstrolling up and down the main street, decided upon an inn where the\\r\\nrounded window suggested substantial fare, nor were they mistaken. For\\r\\nover a hundred and fifty years hot joints, potatoes, greens, and apple\\r\\npuddings had been served to generations of country gentlemen, and now,\\r\\nsitting at a table in the hollow of the bow window, Ralph and Mary took\\r\\ntheir share of this perennial feast. Looking across the joint, half-way\\r\\nthrough the meal, Mary wondered whether Ralph would ever come to look\\r\\nquite like the other people in the room. Would he be absorbed among the\\r\\nround pink faces, pricked with little white bristles, the calves fitted\\r\\nin shiny brown leather, the black-and-white check suits, which were\\r\\nsprinkled about in the same room with them? She half hoped so; she\\r\\nthought that it was only in his mind that he was different. She did not\\r\\nwish him to be too different from other people. The walk had given him\\r\\na ruddy color, too, and his eyes were lit up by a steady, honest light,\\r\\nwhich could not make the simplest farmer feel ill at ease, or suggest\\r\\nto the most devout of clergymen a disposition to sneer at his faith. She\\r\\nloved the steep cliff of his forehead, and compared it to the brow of a\\r\\nyoung Greek horseman, who reins his horse back so sharply that it\\r\\nhalf falls on its haunches. He always seemed to her like a rider on a\\r\\nspirited horse. And there was an exaltation to her in being with him,\\r\\nbecause there was a risk that he would not be able to keep to the right\\r\\npace among other people. Sitting opposite him at the little table in\\r\\nthe window, she came back to that state of careless exaltation which had\\r\\novercome her when they halted by the gate, but now it was accompanied by\\r\\na sense of sanity and security, for she felt that they had a feeling\\r\\nin common which scarcely needed embodiment in words. How silent he\\r\\nwas! leaning his forehead on his hand, now and then, and again looking\\r\\nsteadily and gravely at the backs of the two men at the next table,\\r\\nwith so little self-consciousness that she could almost watch his mind\\r\\nplacing one thought solidly upon the top of another; she thought that\\r\\nshe could feel him thinking, through the shade of her fingers, and\\r\\nshe could anticipate the exact moment when he would put an end to his\\r\\nthought and turn a little in his chair and say:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Mary--?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d inviting her to take up the thread of thought where he\\r\\nhad dropped it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd at that very moment he turned just so, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Mary?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d with the curious touch of diffidence which she loved in\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe laughed, and she explained her laugh on the spur of the moment by\\r\\nthe look of the people in the street below. There was a motor-car\\r\\nwith an old lady swathed in blue veils, and a ladyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s maid on the seat\\r\\nopposite, holding a King CharlesÃ¢\\x80\\x99s spaniel; there was a country-woman\\r\\nwheeling a perambulator full of sticks down the middle of the road;\\r\\nthere was a bailiff in gaiters discussing the state of the cattle market\\r\\nwith a dissenting minister--so she defined them.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe ran over this list without any fear that her companion would think\\r\\nher trivial. Indeed, whether it was due to the warmth of the room or to\\r\\nthe good roast beef, or whether Ralph had achieved the process which is\\r\\ncalled making up oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mind, certainly he had given up testing the good\\r\\nsense, the independent character, the intelligence shown in her remarks.\\r\\nHe had been building one of those piles of thought, as ramshackle and\\r\\nfantastic as a Chinese pagoda, half from words let fall by gentlemen in\\r\\ngaiters, half from the litter in his own mind, about duck shooting and\\r\\nlegal history, about the Roman occupation of Lincoln and the relations\\r\\nof country gentlemen with their wives, when, from all this disconnected\\r\\nrambling, there suddenly formed itself in his mind the idea that he\\r\\nwould ask Mary to marry him. The idea was so spontaneous that it seemed\\r\\nto shape itself of its own accord before his eyes. It was then that he\\r\\nturned round and made use of his old, instinctive phrase:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Mary--?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it presented itself to him at first, the idea was so new and\\r\\ninteresting that he was half inclined to address it, without more ado,\\r\\nto Mary herself. His natural instinct to divide his thoughts carefully\\r\\ninto two different classes before he expressed them to her prevailed.\\r\\nBut as he watched her looking out of the window and describing the old\\r\\nlady, the woman with the perambulator, the bailiff and the dissenting\\r\\nminister, his eyes filled involuntarily with tears. He would have liked\\r\\nto lay his head on her shoulder and sob, while she parted his hair with\\r\\nher fingers and soothed him and said:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere, there. DonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t cry! Tell me why youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re crying--Ã¢\\x80\\x9c; and they would\\r\\nclasp each other tight, and her arms would hold him like his motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\nHe felt that he was very lonely, and that he was afraid of the other\\r\\npeople in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow damnable this all is!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat are you talking about?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied, rather vaguely, still looking\\r\\nout of the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe resented this divided attention more than, perhaps, he knew, and he\\r\\nthought how Mary would soon be on her way to America.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI want to talk to you. HavenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t we nearly done? Why\\r\\ndonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t they take away these plates?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary felt his agitation without looking at him; she felt convinced that\\r\\nshe knew what it was that he wished to say to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll come all in good time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said; and felt it necessary to\\r\\ndisplay her extreme calmness by lifting a salt-cellar and sweeping up a\\r\\nlittle heap of bread-crumbs.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI want to apologize,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph continued, not quite knowing what he was\\r\\nabout to say, but feeling some curious instinct which urged him to\\r\\ncommit himself irrevocably, and to prevent the moment of intimacy from\\r\\npassing.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve treated you very badly. That is, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve told you lies. Did\\r\\nyou guess that I was lying to you? Once in LincolnÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Inn Fields and\\r\\nagain to-day on our walk. I am a liar, Mary. Did you know that? Do you\\r\\nthink you do know me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think I do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point the waiter changed their plates.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s true I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want you to go to America,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, looking fixedly\\r\\nat the table-cloth. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIn fact, my feelings towards you seem to be utterly\\r\\nand damnably bad,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said energetically, although forced to keep his\\r\\nvoice low.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf I werenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t a selfish beast I should tell you to have nothing more to\\r\\ndo with me. And yet, Mary, in spite of the fact that I believe what IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nsaying, I also believe that itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s good we should know each other--the\\r\\nworld being what it is, you see--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and by a nod of his head he indicated\\r\\nthe other occupants of the room, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor, of course, in an ideal state of\\r\\nthings, in a decent community even, thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no doubt you shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have\\r\\nanything to do with me--seriously, that is.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou forget that IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not an ideal character, either,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, in\\r\\nthe same low and very earnest tones, which, in spite of being almost\\r\\ninaudible, surrounded their table with an atmosphere of concentration\\r\\nwhich was quite perceptible to the other diners, who glanced at them now\\r\\nand then with a queer mixture of kindness, amusement, and curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m much more selfish than I let on, and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m worldly a little--more\\r\\nthan you think, anyhow. I like bossing things--perhaps thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s my\\r\\ngreatest fault. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve none of your passion for--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d here she hesitated, and\\r\\nglanced at him, as if to ascertain what his passion was for--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor the\\r\\ntruth,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, as if she had found what she sought indisputably.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve told you IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m a liar,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph repeated obstinately.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, in little things, I dare say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said impatiently. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut not in\\r\\nreal ones, and thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what matters. I dare say IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m more truthful than\\r\\nyou are in small ways. But I could never careÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--she was surprised to\\r\\nfind herself speaking the word, and had to force herself to speak it\\r\\nout--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor any one who was a liar in that way. I love the truth a certain\\r\\namount--a considerable amount--but not in the way you love it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Her\\r\\nvoice sank, became inaudible, and wavered as if she could scarcely keep\\r\\nherself from tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph exclaimed to himself. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe loves me! Why did I\\r\\nnever see it before? SheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s going to cry; no, but she canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t speak.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe certainty overwhelmed him so that he scarcely knew what he was\\r\\ndoing; the blood rushed to his cheeks, and although he had quite made\\r\\nup his mind to ask her to marry him, the certainty that she loved him\\r\\nseemed to change the situation so completely that he could not do it.\\r\\nHe did not dare to look at her. If she cried, he did not know what he\\r\\nshould do. It seemed to him that something of a terrible and devastating\\r\\nnature had happened. The waiter changed their plates once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his agitation Ralph rose, turned his back upon Mary, and looked out\\r\\nof the window. The people in the street seemed to him only a dissolving\\r\\nand combining pattern of black particles; which, for the moment,\\r\\nrepresented very well the involuntary procession of feelings and\\r\\nthoughts which formed and dissolved in rapid succession in his own mind.\\r\\nAt one moment he exulted in the thought that Mary loved him; at the\\r\\nnext, it seemed that he was without feeling for her; her love was\\r\\nrepulsive to him. Now he felt urged to marry her at once; now to\\r\\ndisappear and never see her again. In order to control this disorderly\\r\\nrace of thought he forced himself to read the name on the chemistÃ¢\\x80\\x99s shop\\r\\ndirectly opposite him; then to examine the objects in the shop windows,\\r\\nand then to focus his eyes exactly upon a little group of women looking\\r\\nin at the great windows of a large draperÃ¢\\x80\\x99s shop. This discipline having\\r\\ngiven him at least a superficial control of himself, he was about to\\r\\nturn and ask the waiter to bring the bill, when his eye was caught by a\\r\\ntall figure walking quickly along the opposite pavement--a tall figure,\\r\\nupright, dark, and commanding, much detached from her surroundings. She\\r\\nheld her gloves in her left hand, and the left hand was bare. All this\\r\\nRalph noticed and enumerated and recognized before he put a name to the\\r\\nwhole--Katharine Hilbery. She seemed to be looking for somebody. Her\\r\\neyes, in fact, scanned both sides of the street, and for one second were\\r\\nraised directly to the bow window in which Ralph stood; but she looked\\r\\naway again instantly without giving any sign that she had seen him. This\\r\\nsudden apparition had an extraordinary effect upon him. It was as if he\\r\\nhad thought of her so intensely that his mind had formed the shape\\r\\nof her, rather than that he had seen her in the flesh outside in the\\r\\nstreet. And yet he had not been thinking of her at all. The impression\\r\\nwas so intense that he could not dismiss it, nor even think whether\\r\\nhe had seen her or merely imagined her. He sat down at once, and said,\\r\\nbriefly and strangely, rather to himself than to Mary:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat was Katharine Hilbery.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine Hilbery? What do you mean?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked, hardly understanding\\r\\nfrom his manner whether he had seen her or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine Hilbery,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s gone now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine Hilbery!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary thought, in an instant of blinding revelation;\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve always known it was Katharine Hilbery!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She knew it all now.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a moment of downcast stupor, she raised her eyes, looked steadily\\r\\nat Ralph, and caught his fixed and dreamy gaze leveled at a point far\\r\\nbeyond their surroundings, a point that she had never reached in all\\r\\nthe time that she had known him. She noticed the lips just parted, the\\r\\nfingers loosely clenched, the whole attitude of rapt contemplation,\\r\\nwhich fell like a veil between them. She noticed everything about him;\\r\\nif there had been other signs of his utter alienation she would have\\r\\nsought them out, too, for she felt that it was only by heaping one truth\\r\\nupon another that she could keep herself sitting there, upright. The\\r\\ntruth seemed to support her; it struck her, even as she looked at his\\r\\nface, that the light of truth was shining far away beyond him; the light\\r\\nof truth, she seemed to frame the words as she rose to go, shines on a\\r\\nworld not to be shaken by our personal calamities.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph handed her her coat and her stick. She took them, fastened the\\r\\ncoat securely, grasped the stick firmly. The ivy spray was still twisted\\r\\nabout the handle; this one sacrifice, she thought, she might make to\\r\\nsentimentality and personality, and she picked two leaves from the ivy\\r\\nand put them in her pocket before she disencumbered her stick of the\\r\\nrest of it. She grasped the stick in the middle, and settled her fur cap\\r\\nclosely upon her head, as if she must be in trim for a long and stormy\\r\\nwalk. Next, standing in the middle of the road, she took a slip of paper\\r\\nfrom her purse, and read out loud a list of commissions entrusted to\\r\\nher--fruit, butter, string, and so on; and all the time she never spoke\\r\\ndirectly to Ralph or looked at him.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph heard her giving orders to attentive, rosy-checked men in white\\r\\naprons, and in spite of his own preoccupation, he commented upon the\\r\\ndetermination with which she made her wishes known. Once more he began,\\r\\nautomatically, to take stock of her characteristics. Standing\\r\\nthus, superficially observant and stirring the sawdust on the floor\\r\\nmeditatively with the toe of his boot, he was roused by a musical\\r\\nand familiar voice behind him, accompanied by a light touch upon his\\r\\nshoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not mistaken? Surely Mr. Denham? I caught a glimpse of your coat\\r\\nthrough the window, and I felt sure that I knew your coat. Have you\\r\\nseen Katharine or William? IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m wandering about Lincoln looking for the\\r\\nruins.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Mrs. Hilbery; her entrance created some stir in the shop; many\\r\\npeople looked at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFirst of all, tell me where I am,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she demanded, but, catching sight\\r\\nof the attentive shopman, she appealed to him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe ruins--my party is\\r\\nwaiting for me at the ruins. The Roman ruins--or Greek, Mr. Denham? Your\\r\\ntown has a great many beautiful things in it, but I wish it hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nso many ruins. I never saw such delightful little pots of honey in my\\r\\nlife--are they made by your own bees? Please give me one of those little\\r\\npots, and tell me how I shall find my way to the ruins.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd now,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued, having received the information and the pot\\r\\nof honey, having been introduced to Mary, and having insisted that they\\r\\nshould accompany her back to the ruins, since in a town with so many\\r\\nturnings, such prospects, such delightful little half-naked boys\\r\\ndabbling in pools, such Venetian canals, such old blue china in the\\r\\ncuriosity shops, it was impossible for one person all alone to find\\r\\nher way to the ruins. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cplease tell me what\\r\\nyouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re doing here, Mr. Denham--for you ARE Mr. Denham, arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\ninquired, gazing at him with a sudden suspicion of her own accuracy.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe brilliant young man who writes for the Review, I mean? Only\\r\\nyesterday my husband was telling me he thought you one of the cleverest\\r\\nyoung men he knew. Certainly, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been the messenger of Providence to\\r\\nme, for unless IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d seen you IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure I should never have found the ruins\\r\\nat all.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had reached the Roman arch when Mrs. Hilbery caught sight of her\\r\\nown party, standing like sentinels facing up and down the road so as to\\r\\nintercept her if, as they expected, she had got lodged in some shop.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve found something much better than ruins!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\nfound two friends who told me how to find you, which I could never have\\r\\ndone without them. They must come and have tea with us. What a pity that\\r\\nweÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve just had luncheon.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Could they not somehow revoke that meal?\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine, who had gone a few steps by herself down the road, and was\\r\\ninvestigating the window of an ironmonger, as if her mother might have\\r\\ngot herself concealed among mowing-machines and garden-shears, turned\\r\\nsharply on hearing her voice, and came towards them. She was a great\\r\\ndeal surprised to see Denham and Mary Datchet. Whether the cordiality\\r\\nwith which she greeted them was merely that which is natural to a\\r\\nsurprise meeting in the country, or whether she was really glad to see\\r\\nthem both, at any rate she exclaimed with unusual pleasure as she shook\\r\\nhands:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI never knew you lived here. Why didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you say so, and we could have\\r\\nmet? And are you staying with Mary?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued, turning to Ralph.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat a pity we didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t meet before.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThus confronted at a distance of only a few feet by the real body of the\\r\\nwoman about whom he had dreamt so many million dreams, Ralph stammered;\\r\\nhe made a clutch at his self-control; the color either came to his\\r\\ncheeks or left them, he knew not which; but he was determined to face\\r\\nher and track down in the cold light of day whatever vestige of truth\\r\\nthere might be in his persistent imaginations. He did not succeed in\\r\\nsaying anything. It was Mary who spoke for both of them. He was struck\\r\\ndumb by finding that Katharine was quite different, in some strange\\r\\nway, from his memory, so that he had to dismiss his old view in order\\r\\nto accept the new one. The wind was blowing her crimson scarf across her\\r\\nface; the wind had already loosened her hair, which looped across the\\r\\ncorner of one of the large, dark eyes which, so he used to think, looked\\r\\nsad; now they looked bright with the brightness of the sea struck by an\\r\\nunclouded ray; everything about her seemed rapid, fragmentary, and full\\r\\nof a kind of racing speed. He realized suddenly that he had never seen\\r\\nher in the daylight before.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, it was decided that it was too late to go in search of ruins\\r\\nas they had intended; and the whole party began to walk towards the\\r\\nstables where the carriage had been put up.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you know,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, keeping slightly in advance of the rest\\r\\nwith Ralph, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI thought I saw you this morning, standing at a window.\\r\\nBut I decided that it couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be you. And it must have been you all the\\r\\nsame.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I thought I saw you--but it wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis remark, and the rough strain in his voice, recalled to her memory\\r\\nso many difficult speeches and abortive meetings that she was jerked\\r\\ndirectly back to the London drawing-room, the family relics, and\\r\\nthe tea-table; and at the same time recalled some half-finished or\\r\\ninterrupted remark which she had wanted to make herself or to hear from\\r\\nhim--she could not remember what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI expect it was me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI was looking for my mother. It happens\\r\\nevery time we come to Lincoln. In fact, there never was a family so\\r\\nunable to take care of itself as ours is. Not that it very much matters,\\r\\nbecause some one always turns up in the nick of time to help us out\\r\\nof our scrapes. Once I was left in a field with a bull when I was a\\r\\nbaby--but where did we leave the carriage? Down that street or the\\r\\nnext? The next, I think.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She glanced back and saw that the others were\\r\\nfollowing obediently, listening to certain memories of Lincoln upon\\r\\nwhich Mrs. Hilbery had started. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut what are you doing here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m buying a cottage. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m going to live here--as soon as I can find a\\r\\ncottage, and Mary tells me thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be no difficulty about that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed, almost standing still in her surprise, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou will\\r\\ngive up the Bar, then?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d It flashed across her mind that he must already\\r\\nbe engaged to Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe solicitorÃ¢\\x80\\x99s office? Yes. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m giving that up.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut why?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked. She answered herself at once, with a curious\\r\\nchange from rapid speech to an almost melancholy tone. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re\\r\\nvery wise to give it up. You will be much happier.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this very moment, when her words seemed to be striking a path into\\r\\nthe future for him, they stepped into the yard of an inn, and there\\r\\nbeheld the family coach of the Otways, to which one sleek horse was\\r\\nalready attached, while the second was being led out of the stable door\\r\\nby the hostler.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know what one means by happiness,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said briefly, having to\\r\\nstep aside in order to avoid a groom with a bucket. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy do you think I\\r\\nshall be happy? I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t expect to be anything of the kind. I expect to\\r\\nbe rather less unhappy. I shall write a book and curse my charwoman--if\\r\\nhappiness consists in that. What do you think?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not answer because they were immediately surrounded by other\\r\\nmembers of the party--by Mrs. Hilbery, and Mary, Henry Otway, and\\r\\nWilliam.\\r\\n\\r\\nRodney went up to Katharine immediately and said to her:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHenry is going to drive home with your mother, and I suggest that they\\r\\nshould put us down half-way and let us walk back.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine nodded her head. She glanced at him with an oddly furtive\\r\\nexpression.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUnfortunately we go in opposite directions, or we might have given you\\r\\na lift,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he continued to Denham. His manner was unusually peremptory; he\\r\\nseemed anxious to hasten the departure, and Katharine looked at him from\\r\\ntime to time, as Denham noticed, with an expression half of inquiry,\\r\\nhalf of annoyance. She at once helped her mother into her cloak, and\\r\\nsaid to Mary:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI want to see you. Are you going back to London at once? I will\\r\\nwrite.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She half smiled at Ralph, but her look was a little overcast by\\r\\nsomething she was thinking, and in a very few minutes the Otway carriage\\r\\nrolled out of the stable yard and turned down the high road leading to\\r\\nthe village of Lampsher.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe return drive was almost as silent as the drive from home had been\\r\\nin the morning; indeed, Mrs. Hilbery leant back with closed eyes in\\r\\nher corner, and either slept or feigned sleep, as her habit was in the\\r\\nintervals between the seasons of active exertion, or continued the story\\r\\nwhich she had begun to tell herself that morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout two miles from Lampsher the road ran over the rounded summit of\\r\\nthe heath, a lonely spot marked by an obelisk of granite, setting forth\\r\\nthe gratitude of some great lady of the eighteenth century who had been\\r\\nset upon by highwaymen at this spot and delivered from death just as\\r\\nhope seemed lost. In summer it was a pleasant place, for the deep woods\\r\\non either side murmured, and the heather, which grew thick round the\\r\\ngranite pedestal, made the light breeze taste sweetly; in winter the\\r\\nsighing of the trees was deepened to a hollow sound, and the heath was\\r\\nas gray and almost as solitary as the empty sweep of the clouds above\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Rodney stopped the carriage and helped Katharine to alight. Henry,\\r\\ntoo, gave her his hand, and fancied that she pressed it very slightly\\r\\nin parting as if she sent him a message. But the carriage rolled on\\r\\nimmediately, without wakening Mrs. Hilbery, and left the couple standing\\r\\nby the obelisk. That Rodney was angry with her and had made this\\r\\nopportunity for speaking to her, Katharine knew very well; she was\\r\\nneither glad nor sorry that the time had come, nor, indeed, knew what to\\r\\nexpect, and thus remained silent. The carriage grew smaller and smaller\\r\\nupon the dusky road, and still Rodney did not speak. Perhaps, she\\r\\nthought, he waited until the last sign of the carriage had disappeared\\r\\nbeneath the curve of the road and they were left entirely alone. To\\r\\ncloak their silence she read the writing on the obelisk, to do which she\\r\\nhad to walk completely round it. She was murmuring a word to two of the\\r\\npious ladyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s thanks above her breath when Rodney joined her. In silence\\r\\nthey set out along the cart-track which skirted the verge of the trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo break the silence was exactly what Rodney wished to do, and yet could\\r\\nnot do to his own satisfaction. In company it was far easier to approach\\r\\nKatharine; alone with her, the aloofness and force of her character\\r\\nchecked all his natural methods of attack. He believed that she had\\r\\nbehaved very badly to him, but each separate instance of unkindness\\r\\nseemed too petty to be advanced when they were alone together.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no need for us to race,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he complained at last; upon which she\\r\\nimmediately slackened her pace, and walked too slowly to suit him. In\\r\\ndesperation he said the first thing he thought of, very peevishly and\\r\\nwithout the dignified prelude which he had intended.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve not enjoyed my holiday.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. I shall be glad to get back to work again.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSaturday, Sunday, Monday--there are only three days more,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she counted.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo one enjoys being made a fool of before other people,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he blurted\\r\\nout, for his irritation rose as she spoke, and got the better of his awe\\r\\nof her, and was inflamed by that awe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat refers to me, I suppose,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said calmly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEvery day since weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been here youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve done something to make me appear\\r\\nridiculous,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he went on. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course, so long as it amuses you, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re\\r\\nwelcome; but we have to remember that we are going to spend our lives\\r\\ntogether. I asked you, only this morning, for example, to come out and\\r\\ntake a turn with me in the garden. I was waiting for you ten minutes,\\r\\nand you never came. Every one saw me waiting. The stable-boys saw me.\\r\\nI was so ashamed that I went in. Then, on the drive you hardly spoke to\\r\\nme. Henry noticed it. Every one notices it.... You find no difficulty in\\r\\ntalking to Henry, though.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe noted these various complaints and determined philosophically\\r\\nto answer none of them, although the last stung her to considerable\\r\\nirritation. She wished to find out how deep his grievance lay.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNone of these things seem to me to matter,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery well, then. I may as well hold my tongue,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn themselves they donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t seem to me to matter; if they hurt you, of\\r\\ncourse they matter,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she corrected herself scrupulously. Her tone of\\r\\nconsideration touched him, and he walked on in silence for a space.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd we might be so happy, Katharine!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed impulsively, and\\r\\ndrew her arm through his. She withdrew it directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs long as you let yourself feel like this we shall never be happy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe harshness, which Henry had noticed, was again unmistakable in her\\r\\nmanner. William flinched and was silent. Such severity, accompanied\\r\\nby something indescribably cold and impersonal in her manner, had\\r\\nconstantly been meted out to him during the last few days, always in the\\r\\ncompany of others. He had recouped himself by some ridiculous display of\\r\\nvanity which, as he knew, put him still more at her mercy. Now that\\r\\nhe was alone with her there was no stimulus from outside to draw his\\r\\nattention from his injury. By a considerable effort of self-control he\\r\\nforced himself to remain silent, and to make himself distinguish what\\r\\npart of his pain was due to vanity, what part to the certainty that no\\r\\nwoman really loving him could speak thus.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do I feel about Katharine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he thought to himself. It was clear\\r\\nthat she had been a very desirable and distinguished figure, the\\r\\nmistress of her little section of the world; but more than that, she was\\r\\nthe person of all others who seemed to him the arbitress of life, the\\r\\nwoman whose judgment was naturally right and steady, as his had never\\r\\nbeen in spite of all his culture. And then he could not see her come\\r\\ninto a room without a sense of the flowing of robes, of the flowering of\\r\\nblossoms, of the purple waves of the sea, of all things that are lovely\\r\\nand mutable on the surface but still and passionate in their heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf she were callous all the time and had only led me on to laugh at me\\r\\nI couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have felt that about her,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he thought. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not a fool, after\\r\\nall. I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have been utterly mistaken all these years. And yet, when\\r\\nshe speaks to me like that! The truth of it is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he thought, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\ngot such despicable faults that no one could help speaking to me\\r\\nlike that. Katharine is quite right. And yet those are not my serious\\r\\nfeelings, as she knows quite well. How can I change myself? What would\\r\\nmake her care for me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He was terribly tempted here to break the silence\\r\\nby asking Katharine in what respects he could change himself to suit\\r\\nher; but he sought consolation instead by running over the list of his\\r\\ngifts and acquirements, his knowledge of Greek and Latin, his knowledge\\r\\nof art and literature, his skill in the management of meters, and his\\r\\nancient west-country blood. But the feeling that underlay all these\\r\\nfeelings and puzzled him profoundly and kept him silent was the\\r\\ncertainty that he loved Katharine as sincerely as he had it in him to\\r\\nlove any one. And yet she could speak to him like that! In a sort of\\r\\nbewilderment he lost all desire to speak, and would quite readily have\\r\\ntaken up some different topic of conversation if Katharine had started\\r\\none. This, however, she did not do.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glanced at her, in case her expression might help him to understand\\r\\nher behavior. As usual, she had quickened her pace unconsciously, and\\r\\nwas now walking a little in front of him; but he could gain little\\r\\ninformation from her eyes, which looked steadily at the brown heather,\\r\\nor from the lines drawn seriously upon her forehead. Thus to lose touch\\r\\nwith her, for he had no idea what she was thinking, was so unpleasant to\\r\\nhim that he began to talk about his grievances again, without, however,\\r\\nmuch conviction in his voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you have no feeling for me, wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it be kinder to say so to me in\\r\\nprivate?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, William,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she burst out, as if he had interrupted some absorbing\\r\\ntrain of thought, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow you go on about feelings! IsnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it better not to\\r\\ntalk so much, not to be worrying always about small things that donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nreally matter?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the question precisely,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI only want you to tell\\r\\nme that they donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t matter. There are times when you seem indifferent to\\r\\neverything. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m vain, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve a thousand faults; but you know theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not\\r\\neverything; you know I care for you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd if I say that I care for you, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you believe me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSay it, Katharine! Say it as if you meant it! Make me feel that you\\r\\ncare for me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not force herself to speak a word. The heather was growing dim\\r\\naround them, and the horizon was blotted out by white mist. To ask her\\r\\nfor passion or for certainty seemed like asking that damp prospect for\\r\\nfierce blades of fire, or the faded sky for the intense blue vault of\\r\\nJune.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on now to tell her of his love for her, in words which bore,\\r\\neven to her critical senses, the stamp of truth; but none of this\\r\\ntouched her, until, coming to a gate whose hinge was rusty, he heaved\\r\\nit open with his shoulder, still talking and taking no account of his\\r\\neffort. The virility of this deed impressed her; and yet, normally, she\\r\\nattached no value to the power of opening gates. The strength of muscles\\r\\nhas nothing to do on the face of it with the strength of affections;\\r\\nnevertheless, she felt a sudden concern for this power running to waste\\r\\non her account, which, combined with a desire to keep possession of that\\r\\nstrangely attractive masculine power, made her rouse herself from her\\r\\ntorpor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy should she not simply tell him the truth--which was that she had\\r\\naccepted him in a misty state of mind when nothing had its right shape\\r\\nor size? that it was deplorable, but that with clearer eyesight marriage\\r\\nwas out of the question? She did not want to marry any one. She wanted\\r\\nto go away by herself, preferably to some bleak northern moor, and\\r\\nthere study mathematics and the science of astronomy. Twenty words would\\r\\nexplain the whole situation to him. He had ceased to speak; he had told\\r\\nher once more how he loved her and why. She summoned her courage, fixed\\r\\nher eyes upon a lightning-splintered ash-tree, and, almost as if she\\r\\nwere reading a writing fixed to the trunk, began:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI was wrong to get engaged to you. I shall never make you happy. I have\\r\\nnever loved you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he protested.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, never,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she repeated obstinately. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot rightly. DonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you see, I\\r\\ndidnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know what I was doing?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou love some one else?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he cut her short.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAbsolutely no one.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHenry?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHenry? I should have thought, William, even you--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere is some one,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he persisted. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere has been a change in the last\\r\\nfew weeks. You owe it to me to be honest, Katharine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf I could, I would,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy did you tell me you would marry me, then?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, indeed? A moment of pessimism, a sudden conviction of the\\r\\nundeniable prose of life, a lapse of the illusion which sustains youth\\r\\nmidway between heaven and earth, a desperate attempt to reconcile\\r\\nherself with facts--she could only recall a moment, as of waking from a\\r\\ndream, which now seemed to her a moment of surrender. But who could give\\r\\nreasons such as these for doing what she had done? She shook her head\\r\\nvery sadly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not a child--youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not a woman of moods,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney persisted.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have accepted me if you hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t loved me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sense of her own misbehavior, which she had succeeded in keeping from\\r\\nher by sharpening her consciousness of RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s faults, now swept over\\r\\nher and almost overwhelmed her. What were his faults in comparison with\\r\\nthe fact that he cared for her? What were her virtues in comparison with\\r\\nthe fact that she did not care for him? In a flash the conviction that\\r\\nnot to care is the uttermost sin of all stamped itself upon her inmost\\r\\nthought; and she felt herself branded for ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had taken her arm, and held her hand firmly in his, nor had she the\\r\\nforce to resist what now seemed to her his enormously superior strength.\\r\\nVery well; she would submit, as her mother and her aunt and most women,\\r\\nperhaps, had submitted; and yet she knew that every second of such\\r\\nsubmission to his strength was a second of treachery to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI did say I would marry you, but it was wrong,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she forced herself\\r\\nto say, and she stiffened her arm as if to annul even the seeming\\r\\nsubmission of that separate part of her; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t love you,\\r\\nWilliam; youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve noticed it, every oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s noticed it; why should we go on\\r\\npretending? When I told you I loved you, I was wrong. I said what I knew\\r\\nto be untrue.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs none of her words seemed to her at all adequate to represent what\\r\\nshe felt, she repeated them, and emphasized them without realizing\\r\\nthe effect that they might have upon a man who cared for her. She was\\r\\ncompletely taken aback by finding her arm suddenly dropped; then she saw\\r\\nhis face most strangely contorted; was he laughing, it flashed across\\r\\nher? In another moment she saw that he was in tears. In her bewilderment\\r\\nat this apparition she stood aghast for a second. With a desperate sense\\r\\nthat this horror must, at all costs, be stopped, she then put her arms\\r\\nabout him, drew his head for a moment upon her shoulder, and led him on,\\r\\nmurmuring words of consolation, until he heaved a great sigh. They held\\r\\nfast to each other; her tears, too, ran down her cheeks; and were both\\r\\nquite silent. Noticing the difficulty with which he walked, and feeling\\r\\nthe same extreme lassitude in her own limbs, she proposed that they\\r\\nshould rest for a moment where the bracken was brown and shriveled\\r\\nbeneath an oak-tree. He assented. Once more he gave a great sigh, and\\r\\nwiped his eyes with a childlike unconsciousness, and began to speak\\r\\nwithout a trace of his previous anger. The idea came to her that they\\r\\nwere like the children in the fairy tale who were lost in a wood, and\\r\\nwith this in her mind she noticed the scattering of dead leaves all\\r\\nround them which had been blown by the wind into heaps, a foot or two\\r\\ndeep, here and there.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen did you begin to feel this, Katharine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor it isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ntrue to say that youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve always felt it. I admit I was unreasonable\\r\\nthe first night when you found that your clothes had been left behind.\\r\\nStill, whereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the fault in that? I could promise you never to interfere\\r\\nwith your clothes again. I admit I was cross when I found you upstairs\\r\\nwith Henry. Perhaps I showed it too openly. But thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not unreasonable\\r\\neither when oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s engaged. Ask your mother. And now this terrible\\r\\nthing--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He broke off, unable for the moment to proceed any further.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis decision you say youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve come to--have you discussed it with any\\r\\none? Your mother, for example, or Henry?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no, of course not,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, stirring the leaves with her hand.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand me, William--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHelp me to understand you--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand, I mean, my real feelings; how could you? IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\nonly now faced them myself. But I havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t got the sort of feeling--love,\\r\\nI mean--I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know what to call itÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--she looked vaguely towards the\\r\\nhorizon sunk under mist--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut, anyhow, without it our marriage would be\\r\\na farce--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow a farce?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut this kind of analysis is disastrous!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nexclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should have done it before,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said gloomily.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou make yourself think things you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he continued, becoming\\r\\ndemonstrative with his hands, as his manner was. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBelieve me, Katharine,\\r\\nbefore we came here we were perfectly happy. You were full of plans for\\r\\nour house--the chair-covers, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you remember?--like any other woman\\r\\nwho is about to be married. Now, for no reason whatever, you begin to\\r\\nfret about your feeling and about my feeling, with the usual result. I\\r\\nassure you, Katharine, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been through it all myself. At one time I\\r\\nwas always asking myself absurd questions which came to nothing either.\\r\\nWhat you want, if I may say so, is some occupation to take you out\\r\\nof yourself when this morbid mood comes on. If it hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t been for my\\r\\npoetry, I assure you, I should often have been very much in the same\\r\\nstate myself. To let you into a secret,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he continued, with his little\\r\\nchuckle, which now sounded almost assured, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve often gone home from\\r\\nseeing you in such a state of nerves that I had to force myself to write\\r\\na page or two before I could get you out of my head. Ask Denham; heÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ntell you how he met me one night; heÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll tell you what a state he found\\r\\nme in.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine started with displeasure at the mention of RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s name. The\\r\\nthought of the conversation in which her conduct had been made a subject\\r\\nfor discussion with Denham roused her anger; but, as she instantly felt,\\r\\nshe had scarcely the right to grudge William any use of her name, seeing\\r\\nwhat her fault against him had been from first to last. And yet Denham!\\r\\nShe had a view of him as a judge. She figured him sternly weighing\\r\\ninstances of her levity in this masculine court of inquiry into feminine\\r\\nmorality and gruffly dismissing both her and her family with some\\r\\nhalf-sarcastic, half-tolerant phrase which sealed her doom, as far as\\r\\nhe was concerned, for ever. Having met him so lately, the sense of his\\r\\ncharacter was strong in her. The thought was not a pleasant one for\\r\\na proud woman, but she had yet to learn the art of subduing her\\r\\nexpression. Her eyes fixed upon the ground, her brows drawn together,\\r\\ngave William a very fair picture of the resentment that she was forcing\\r\\nherself to control. A certain degree of apprehension, occasionally\\r\\nculminating in a kind of fear, had always entered into his love for her,\\r\\nand had increased, rather to his surprise, in the greater intimacy of\\r\\ntheir engagement. Beneath her steady, exemplary surface ran a vein of\\r\\npassion which seemed to him now perverse, now completely irrational, for\\r\\nit never took the normal channel of glorification of him and his doings;\\r\\nand, indeed, he almost preferred the steady good sense, which had always\\r\\nmarked their relationship, to a more romantic bond. But passion she had,\\r\\nhe could not deny it, and hitherto he had tried to see it employed in\\r\\nhis thoughts upon the lives of the children who were to be born to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe will make a perfect mother--a mother of sons,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he thought; but\\r\\nseeing her sitting there, gloomy and silent, he began to have his doubts\\r\\non this point. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA farce, a farce,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he thought to himself. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe said that\\r\\nour marriage would be a farce,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and he became suddenly aware of their\\r\\nsituation, sitting upon the ground, among the dead leaves, not fifty\\r\\nyards from the main road, so that it was quite possible for some one\\r\\npassing to see and recognize them. He brushed off his face any trace\\r\\nthat might remain of that unseemly exhibition of emotion. But he was\\r\\nmore troubled by KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s appearance, as she sat rapt in thought upon\\r\\nthe ground, than by his own; there was something improper to him in her\\r\\nself-forgetfulness. A man naturally alive to the conventions of society,\\r\\nhe was strictly conventional where women were concerned, and especially\\r\\nif the women happened to be in any way connected with him. He noticed\\r\\nwith distress the long strand of dark hair touching her shoulder and two\\r\\nor three dead beech-leaves attached to her dress; but to recall her\\r\\nmind in their present circumstances to a sense of these details was\\r\\nimpossible. She sat there, seeming unconscious of everything. He\\r\\nsuspected that in her silence she was reproaching herself; but he wished\\r\\nthat she would think of her hair and of the dead beech-leaves, which\\r\\nwere of more immediate importance to him than anything else. Indeed,\\r\\nthese trifles drew his attention strangely from his own doubtful and\\r\\nuneasy state of mind; for relief, mixing itself with pain, stirred up a\\r\\nmost curious hurry and tumult in his breast, almost concealing his\\r\\nfirst sharp sense of bleak and overwhelming disappointment. In order to\\r\\nrelieve this restlessness and close a distressingly ill-ordered scene,\\r\\nhe rose abruptly and helped Katharine to her feet. She smiled a little\\r\\nat the minute care with which he tidied her and yet, when he brushed the\\r\\ndead leaves from his own coat, she flinched, seeing in that action the\\r\\ngesture of a lonely man.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWilliam,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI will marry you. I will try to make you happy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIX\\r\\n\\r\\nThe afternoon was already growing dark when the two other wayfarers,\\r\\nMary and Ralph Denham, came out on the high road beyond the outskirts\\r\\nof Lincoln. The high road, as they both felt, was better suited to this\\r\\nreturn journey than the open country, and for the first mile or so\\r\\nof the way they spoke little. In his own mind Ralph was following the\\r\\npassage of the Otway carriage over the heath; he then went back to the\\r\\nfive or ten minutes that he had spent with Katharine, and examined each\\r\\nword with the care that a scholar displays upon the irregularities of\\r\\nan ancient text. He was determined that the glow, the romance, the\\r\\natmosphere of this meeting should not paint what he must in future\\r\\nregard as sober facts. On her side Mary was silent, not because her\\r\\nthoughts took much handling, but because her mind seemed empty of\\r\\nthought as her heart of feeling. Only RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s presence, as she knew,\\r\\npreserved this numbness, for she could foresee a time of loneliness when\\r\\nmany varieties of pain would beset her. At the present moment her effort\\r\\nwas to preserve what she could of the wreck of her self-respect, for\\r\\nsuch she deemed that momentary glimpse of her love so involuntarily\\r\\nrevealed to Ralph. In the light of reason it did not much matter,\\r\\nperhaps, but it was her instinct to be careful of that vision of herself\\r\\nwhich keeps pace so evenly beside every one of us, and had been damaged\\r\\nby her confession. The gray night coming down over the country was kind\\r\\nto her; and she thought that one of these days she would find comfort\\r\\nin sitting upon the earth, alone, beneath a tree. Looking through the\\r\\ndarkness, she marked the swelling ground and the tree. Ralph made her\\r\\nstart by saying abruptly;\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat I was going to say when we were interrupted at lunch was that if\\r\\nyou go to America I shall come, too. It canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be harder to earn a living\\r\\nthere than it is here. However, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not the point. The point is,\\r\\nMary, that I want to marry you. Well, what do you say?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He spoke firmly,\\r\\nwaited for no answer, and took her arm in his. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou know me by this\\r\\ntime, the good and the bad,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he went on. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou know my tempers. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\ntried to let you know my faults. Well, what do you say, Mary?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said nothing, but this did not seem to strike him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn most ways, at least in the important ways, as you said, we know each\\r\\nother and we think alike. I believe you are the only person in the world\\r\\nI could live with happily. And if you feel the same about me--as you do,\\r\\ndonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you, Mary?--we should make each other happy.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Here he paused,\\r\\nand seemed to be in no hurry for an answer; he seemed, indeed, to be\\r\\ncontinuing his own thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, but IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid I couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t do it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary said at last. The casual\\r\\nand rather hurried way in which she spoke, together with the fact\\r\\nthat she was saying the exact opposite of what he expected her to say,\\r\\nbaffled him so much that he instinctively loosened his clasp upon her\\r\\narm and she withdrew it quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t do it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, I couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t marry you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t care for me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Mary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, with a curious laugh, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI must be an arrant fool,\\r\\nfor I thought you did.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d They walked for a minute or two in silence,\\r\\nand suddenly he turned to her, looked at her, and exclaimed: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nbelieve you, Mary. YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not telling me the truth.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m too tired to argue, Ralph,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied, turning her head away from\\r\\nhim. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI ask you to believe what I say. I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t marry you; I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want\\r\\nto marry you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voice in which she stated this was so evidently the voice of one in\\r\\nsome extremity of anguish that Ralph had no course but to obey her. And\\r\\nas soon as the tone of her voice had died out, and the surprise faded\\r\\nfrom his mind, he found himself believing that she had spoken the truth,\\r\\nfor he had but little vanity, and soon her refusal seemed a natural\\r\\nthing to him. He slipped through all the grades of despondency until he\\r\\nreached a bottom of absolute gloom. Failure seemed to mark the whole of\\r\\nhis life; he had failed with Katharine, and now he had failed with\\r\\nMary. Up at once sprang the thought of Katharine, and with it a sense of\\r\\nexulting freedom, but this he checked instantly. No good had ever come\\r\\nto him from Katharine; his whole relationship with her had been made up\\r\\nof dreams; and as he thought of the little substance there had been in\\r\\nhis dreams he began to lay the blame of the present catastrophe upon his\\r\\ndreams.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHavenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t I always been thinking of Katharine while I was with Mary? I\\r\\nmight have loved Mary if it hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t been for that idiocy of mine. She\\r\\ncared for me once, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m certain of that, but I tormented her so with my\\r\\nhumors that I let my chances slip, and now she wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t risk marrying me.\\r\\nAnd this is what IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve made of my life--nothing, nothing, nothing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tramp of their boots upon the dry road seemed to asseverate nothing,\\r\\nnothing, nothing. Mary thought that this silence was the silence\\r\\nof relief; his depression she ascribed to the fact that he had seen\\r\\nKatharine and parted from her, leaving her in the company of William\\r\\nRodney. She could not blame him for loving Katharine, but that, when he\\r\\nloved another, he should ask her to marry him--that seemed to her\\r\\nthe cruellest treachery. Their old friendship and its firm base upon\\r\\nindestructible qualities of character crumbled, and her whole past\\r\\nseemed foolish, herself weak and credulous, and Ralph merely the shell\\r\\nof an honest man. Oh, the past--so much made up of Ralph; and now, as\\r\\nshe saw, made up of something strange and false and other than she had\\r\\nthought it. She tried to recapture a saying she had made to help herself\\r\\nthat morning, as Ralph paid the bill for luncheon; but she could see\\r\\nhim paying the bill more vividly than she could remember the phrase.\\r\\nSomething about truth was in it; how to see the truth is our great\\r\\nchance in this world.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to marry me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph now began again, without\\r\\nabruptness, with diffidence rather, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthere is no need why we should\\r\\ncease to see each other, is there? Or would you rather that we should\\r\\nkeep apart for the present?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKeep apart? I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know--I must think about it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTell me one thing, Mary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he resumed; Ã¢\\x80\\x9chave I done anything to make you\\r\\nchange your mind about me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was immensely tempted to give way to her natural trust in him,\\r\\nrevived by the deep and now melancholy tones of his voice, and to tell\\r\\nhim of her love, and of what had changed it. But although it seemed\\r\\nlikely that she would soon control her anger with him, the certainty\\r\\nthat he did not love her, confirmed by every word of his proposal,\\r\\nforbade any freedom of speech. To hear him speak and to feel herself\\r\\nunable to reply, or constrained in her replies, was so painful that she\\r\\nlonged for the time when she should be alone. A more pliant woman would\\r\\nhave taken this chance of an explanation, whatever risks attached to it;\\r\\nbut to one of MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s firm and resolute temperament there was degradation\\r\\nin the idea of self-abandonment; let the waves of emotion rise ever so\\r\\nhigh, she could not shut her eyes to what she conceived to be the truth.\\r\\nHer silence puzzled Ralph. He searched his memory for words or deeds\\r\\nthat might have made her think badly of him. In his present mood\\r\\ninstances came but too quickly, and on top of them this culminating\\r\\nproof of his baseness--that he had asked her to marry him when his\\r\\nreasons for such a proposal were selfish and half-hearted.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou neednÃ¢\\x80\\x99t answer,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said grimly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere are reasons enough, I know.\\r\\nBut must they kill our friendship, Mary? Let me keep that, at least.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought to herself, with a sudden rush of anguish which\\r\\nthreatened disaster to her self-respect, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cit has come to this--to\\r\\nthis--when I could have given him everything!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, we can still be friends,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, with what firmness she could\\r\\nmuster.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI shall want your friendship,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. He added, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf you find it\\r\\npossible, let me see you as often as you can. The oftener the better. I\\r\\nshall want your help.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe promised this, and they went on to talk calmly of things that had\\r\\nno reference to their feelings--a talk which, in its constraint, was\\r\\ninfinitely sad to both of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne more reference was made to the state of things between them late\\r\\nthat night, when Elizabeth had gone to her room, and the two young men\\r\\nhad stumbled off to bed in such a state of sleep that they hardly felt\\r\\nthe floor beneath their feet after a dayÃ¢\\x80\\x99s shooting.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary drew her chair a little nearer to the fire, for the logs were\\r\\nburning low, and at this time of night it was hardly worth while to\\r\\nreplenish them. Ralph was reading, but she had noticed for some time\\r\\nthat his eyes instead of following the print were fixed rather above the\\r\\npage with an intensity of gloom that came to weigh upon her mind. She\\r\\nhad not weakened in her resolve not to give way, for reflection had only\\r\\nmade her more bitterly certain that, if she gave way, it would be to her\\r\\nown wish and not to his. But she had determined that there was no reason\\r\\nwhy he should suffer if her reticence were the cause of his suffering.\\r\\nTherefore, although she found it painful, she spoke:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou asked me if I had changed my mind about you, Ralph,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nthink thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s only one thing. When you asked me to marry you, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nthink you meant it. That made me angry--for the moment. Before, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nalways spoken the truth.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s book slid down upon his knee and fell upon the floor. He rested\\r\\nhis forehead on his hand and looked into the fire. He was trying to\\r\\nrecall the exact words in which he had made his proposal to Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI never said I loved you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe winced; but she respected him for saying what he did, for this,\\r\\nafter all, was a fragment of the truth which she had vowed to live by.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd to me marriage without love doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t seem worth while,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Mary, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not going to press you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI see you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want\\r\\nto marry me. But love--donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t we all talk a great deal of nonsense about\\r\\nit? What does one mean? I believe I care for you more genuinely than\\r\\nnine men out of ten care for the women theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re in love with. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s only a\\r\\nstory one makes up in oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mind about another person, and one knows all\\r\\nthe time it isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t true. Of course one knows; why, oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s always taking\\r\\ncare not to destroy the illusion. One takes care not to see them too\\r\\noften, or to be alone with them for too long together. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a pleasant\\r\\nillusion, but if youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re thinking of the risks of marriage, it seems to\\r\\nme that the risk of marrying a person youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re in love with is something\\r\\ncolossal.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe a word of that, and whatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s more you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t, either,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she replied with anger. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHowever, we donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t agree; I only wanted you to\\r\\nunderstand.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She shifted her position, as if she were about to go. An\\r\\ninstinctive desire to prevent her from leaving the room made Ralph rise\\r\\nat this point and begin pacing up and down the nearly empty kitchen,\\r\\nchecking his desire, each time he reached the door, to open it and step\\r\\nout into the garden. A moralist might have said that at this point his\\r\\nmind should have been full of self-reproach for the suffering he had\\r\\ncaused. On the contrary, he was extremely angry, with the confused\\r\\nimpotent anger of one who finds himself unreasonably but efficiently\\r\\nfrustrated. He was trapped by the illogicality of human life. The\\r\\nobstacles in the way of his desire seemed to him purely artificial, and\\r\\nyet he could see no way of removing them. MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s words, the tone of her\\r\\nvoice even, angered him, for she would not help him. She was part of the\\r\\ninsanely jumbled muddle of a world which impedes the sensible life. He\\r\\nwould have liked to slam the door or break the hind legs of a chair,\\r\\nfor the obstacles had taken some such curiously substantial shape in his\\r\\nmind.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI doubt that one human being ever understands another,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said,\\r\\nstopping in his march and confronting Mary at a distance of a few feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSuch damned liars as we all are, how can we? But we can try. If you\\r\\ndonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to marry me, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t; but the position you take up about love,\\r\\nand not seeing each other--isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t that mere sentimentality? You think\\r\\nIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve behaved very badly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he continued, as she did not speak. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course\\r\\nI behave badly; but you canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t judge people by what they do. You canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ngo through life measuring right and wrong with a foot-rule. ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what\\r\\nyouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re always doing, Mary; thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re doing now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe saw herself in the Suffrage Office, delivering judgment, meting\\r\\nout right and wrong, and there seemed to her to be some justice in the\\r\\ncharge, although it did not affect her main position.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not angry with you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said slowly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI will go on seeing you, as\\r\\nI said I would.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was true that she had promised that much already, and it was\\r\\ndifficult for him to say what more it was that he wanted--some intimacy,\\r\\nsome help against the ghost of Katharine, perhaps, something that he\\r\\nknew he had no right to ask; and yet, as he sank into his chair and\\r\\nlooked once more at the dying fire it seemed to him that he had been\\r\\ndefeated, not so much by Mary as by life itself. He felt himself thrown\\r\\nback to the beginning of life again, where everything has yet to be won;\\r\\nbut in extreme youth one has an ignorant hope. He was no longer certain\\r\\nthat he would triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XX\\r\\n\\r\\nHappily for Mary Datchet she returned to the office to find that by some\\r\\nobscure Parliamentary maneuver the vote had once more slipped beyond the\\r\\nattainment of women. Mrs. Seal was in a condition bordering upon frenzy.\\r\\nThe duplicity of Ministers, the treachery of mankind, the insult to\\r\\nwomanhood, the setback to civilization, the ruin of her lifeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s work, the\\r\\nfeelings of her fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s daughter--all these topics were discussed in\\r\\nturn, and the office was littered with newspaper cuttings branded with\\r\\nthe blue, if ambiguous, marks of her displeasure. She confessed herself\\r\\nat fault in her estimate of human nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe simple elementary acts of justice,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, waving her hand\\r\\ntowards the window, and indicating the foot-passengers and omnibuses\\r\\nthen passing down the far side of Russell Square, Ã¢\\x80\\x9care as far beyond\\r\\nthem as they ever were. We can only look upon ourselves, Mary, as\\r\\npioneers in a wilderness. We can only go on patiently putting the truth\\r\\nbefore them. It isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t THEM,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued, taking heart from her sight\\r\\nof the traffic, Ã¢\\x80\\x9citÃ¢\\x80\\x99s their leaders. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s those gentlemen sitting in\\r\\nParliament and drawing four hundred a year of the peopleÃ¢\\x80\\x99s money. If we\\r\\nhad to put our case to the people, we should soon have justice done to\\r\\nus. I have always believed in the people, and I do so still. But--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She\\r\\nshook her head and implied that she would give them one more chance,\\r\\nand if they didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t take advantage of that she couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t answer for the\\r\\nconsequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. ClactonÃ¢\\x80\\x99s attitude was more philosophical and better supported by\\r\\nstatistics. He came into the room after Mrs. SealÃ¢\\x80\\x99s outburst and pointed\\r\\nout, with historical illustrations, that such reverses had happened in\\r\\nevery political campaign of any importance. If anything, his spirits\\r\\nwere improved by the disaster. The enemy, he said, had taken the\\r\\noffensive; and it was now up to the Society to outwit the enemy. He gave\\r\\nMary to understand that he had taken the measure of their cunning, and\\r\\nhad already bent his mind to the task which, so far as she could make\\r\\nout, depended solely upon him. It depended, so she came to think,\\r\\nwhen invited into his room for a private conference, upon a systematic\\r\\nrevision of the card-index, upon the issue of certain new lemon-colored\\r\\nleaflets, in which the facts were marshaled once more in a very striking\\r\\nway, and upon a large scale map of England dotted with little pins\\r\\ntufted with differently colored plumes of hair according to their\\r\\ngeographical position. Each district, under the new system, had its\\r\\nflag, its bottle of ink, its sheaf of documents tabulated and filed\\r\\nfor reference in a drawer, so that by looking under M or S, as the\\r\\ncase might be, you had all the facts with respect to the Suffrage\\r\\norganizations of that county at your fingersÃ¢\\x80\\x99 ends. This would require a\\r\\ngreat deal of work, of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe must try to consider ourselves rather in the light of a telephone\\r\\nexchange--for the exchange of ideas, Miss Datchet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said; and taking\\r\\npleasure in his image, he continued it. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe should consider ourselves\\r\\nthe center of an enormous system of wires, connecting us up with every\\r\\ndistrict of the country. We must have our fingers upon the pulse of the\\r\\ncommunity; we want to know what people all over England are thinking; we\\r\\nwant to put them in the way of thinking rightly.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The system, of course,\\r\\nwas only roughly sketched so far--jotted down, in fact, during the\\r\\nChristmas holidays.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen you ought to have been taking a rest, Mr. Clacton,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary\\r\\ndutifully, but her tone was flat and tired.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe learn to do without holidays, Miss Datchet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Clacton, with\\r\\na spark of satisfaction in his eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wished particularly to have her opinion of the lemon-colored leaflet.\\r\\nAccording to his plan, it was to be distributed in immense quantities\\r\\nimmediately, in order to stimulate and generate, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto generate and\\r\\nstimulate,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cright thoughts in the country before the\\r\\nmeeting of Parliament.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe have to take the enemy by surprise,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThey donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t let the\\r\\ngrass grow under their feet. Have you seen BinghamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s address to his\\r\\nconstituents? ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a hint of the sort of thing weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got to meet, Miss\\r\\nDatchet.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe handed her a great bundle of newspaper cuttings, and, begging her to\\r\\ngive him her views upon the yellow leaflet before lunch-time, he turned\\r\\nwith alacrity to his different sheets of paper and his different bottles\\r\\nof ink.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary shut the door, laid the documents upon her table, and sank her\\r\\nhead on her hands. Her brain was curiously empty of any thought. She\\r\\nlistened, as if, perhaps, by listening she would become merged again\\r\\nin the atmosphere of the office. From the next room came the rapid\\r\\nspasmodic sounds of Mrs. SealÃ¢\\x80\\x99s erratic typewriting; she, doubtless, was\\r\\nalready hard at work helping the people of England, as Mr. Clacton\\r\\nput it, to think rightly; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cgenerating and stimulating,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d those were his\\r\\nwords. She was striking a blow against the enemy, no doubt, who didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nlet the grass grow beneath their feet. Mr. ClactonÃ¢\\x80\\x99s words repeated\\r\\nthemselves accurately in her brain. She pushed the papers wearily over\\r\\nto the farther side of the table. It was no use, though; something or\\r\\nother had happened to her brain--a change of focus so that near things\\r\\nwere indistinct again. The same thing had happened to her once before,\\r\\nshe remembered, after she had met Ralph in the gardens of LincolnÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Inn\\r\\nFields; she had spent the whole of a committee meeting in thinking about\\r\\nsparrows and colors, until, almost at the end of the meeting, her old\\r\\nconvictions had all come back to her. But they had only come back, she\\r\\nthought with scorn at her feebleness, because she wanted to use them to\\r\\nfight against Ralph. They werenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t, rightly speaking, convictions at all.\\r\\nShe could not see the world divided into separate compartments of good\\r\\npeople and bad people, any more than she could believe so implicitly in\\r\\nthe rightness of her own thought as to wish to bring the population\\r\\nof the British Isles into agreement with it. She looked at the\\r\\nlemon-colored leaflet, and thought almost enviously of the faith which\\r\\ncould find comfort in the issue of such documents; for herself she would\\r\\nbe content to remain silent for ever if a share of personal happiness\\r\\nwere granted her. She read Mr. ClactonÃ¢\\x80\\x99s statement with a curious\\r\\ndivision of judgment, noting its weak and pompous verbosity on the one\\r\\nhand, and, at the same time, feeling that faith, faith in an illusion,\\r\\nperhaps, but, at any rate, faith in something, was of all gifts the most\\r\\nto be envied. An illusion it was, no doubt. She looked curiously round\\r\\nher at the furniture of the office, at the machinery in which she\\r\\nhad taken so much pride, and marveled to think that once the\\r\\ncopying-presses, the card-index, the files of documents, had all been\\r\\nshrouded, wrapped in some mist which gave them a unity and a general\\r\\ndignity and purpose independently of their separate significance.\\r\\nThe ugly cumbersomeness of the furniture alone impressed her now. Her\\r\\nattitude had become very lax and despondent when the typewriter stopped\\r\\nin the next room. Mary immediately drew up to the table, laid hands on\\r\\nan unopened envelope, and adopted an expression which might hide her\\r\\nstate of mind from Mrs. Seal. Some instinct of decency required that she\\r\\nshould not allow Mrs. Seal to see her face. Shading her eyes with her\\r\\nfingers, she watched Mrs. Seal pull out one drawer after another in her\\r\\nsearch for some envelope or leaflet. She was tempted to drop her fingers\\r\\nand exclaim:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo sit down, Sally, and tell me how you manage it--how you manage, that\\r\\nis, to bustle about with perfect confidence in the necessity of your\\r\\nown activities, which to me seem as futile as the buzzing of a belated\\r\\nblue-bottle.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She said nothing of the kind, however, and the presence of\\r\\nindustry which she preserved so long as Mrs. Seal was in the room served\\r\\nto set her brain in motion, so that she dispatched her morningÃ¢\\x80\\x99s work\\r\\nmuch as usual. At one oÃ¢\\x80\\x99clock she was surprised to find how efficiently\\r\\nshe had dealt with the morning. As she put her hat on she determined\\r\\nto lunch at a shop in the Strand, so as to set that other piece of\\r\\nmechanism, her body, into action. With a brain working and a body\\r\\nworking one could keep step with the crowd and never be found out for\\r\\nthe hollow machine, lacking the essential thing, that one was conscious\\r\\nof being.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe considered her case as she walked down the Charing Cross Road. She\\r\\nput to herself a series of questions. Would she mind, for example, if\\r\\nthe wheels of that motor-omnibus passed over her and crushed her\\r\\nto death? No, not in the least; or an adventure with that\\r\\ndisagreeable-looking man hanging about the entrance of the Tube station?\\r\\nNo; she could not conceive fear or excitement. Did suffering in any form\\r\\nappall her? No, suffering was neither good nor bad. And this essential\\r\\nthing? In the eyes of every single person she detected a flame; as if a\\r\\nspark in the brain ignited spontaneously at contact with the things\\r\\nthey met and drove them on. The young women looking into the millinersÃ¢\\x80\\x99\\r\\nwindows had that look in their eyes; and elderly men turning over books\\r\\nin the second-hand book-shops, and eagerly waiting to hear what the\\r\\nprice was--the very lowest price--they had it, too. But she cared\\r\\nnothing at all for clothes or for money either. Books she shrank from,\\r\\nfor they were connected too closely with Ralph. She kept on her way\\r\\nresolutely through the crowd of people, among whom she was so much of an\\r\\nalien, feeling them cleave and give way before her.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrange thoughts are bred in passing through crowded streets should the\\r\\npassenger, by chance, have no exact destination in front of him, much\\r\\nas the mind shapes all kinds of forms, solutions, images when listening\\r\\ninattentively to music. From an acute consciousness of herself as an\\r\\nindividual, Mary passed to a conception of the scheme of things in\\r\\nwhich, as a human being, she must have her share. She half held a\\r\\nvision; the vision shaped and dwindled. She wished she had a pencil and\\r\\na piece of paper to help her to give a form to this conception which\\r\\ncomposed itself as she walked down the Charing Cross Road. But if she\\r\\ntalked to any one, the conception might escape her. Her vision seemed to\\r\\nlay out the lines of her life until death in a way which satisfied\\r\\nher sense of harmony. It only needed a persistent effort of thought,\\r\\nstimulated in this strange way by the crowd and the noise, to climb the\\r\\ncrest of existence and see it all laid out once and for ever. Already\\r\\nher suffering as an individual was left behind her. Of this process,\\r\\nwhich was to her so full of effort, which comprised infinitely swift\\r\\nand full passages of thought, leading from one crest to another, as she\\r\\nshaped her conception of life in this world, only two articulate\\r\\nwords escaped her, muttered beneath her breath--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot happiness--not\\r\\nhappiness.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down on a seat opposite the statue of one of LondonÃ¢\\x80\\x99s heroes\\r\\nupon the Embankment, and spoke the words aloud. To her they represented\\r\\nthe rare flower or splinter of rock brought down by a climber in proof\\r\\nthat he has stood for a moment, at least, upon the highest peak of\\r\\nthe mountain. She had been up there and seen the world spread to the\\r\\nhorizon. It was now necessary to alter her course to some extent,\\r\\naccording to her new resolve. Her post should be in one of those exposed\\r\\nand desolate stations which are shunned naturally by happy people. She\\r\\narranged the details of the new plan in her mind, not without a grim\\r\\nsatisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, rising from her seat, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll think of Ralph.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere was he to be placed in the new scale of life? Her exalted mood\\r\\nseemed to make it safe to handle the question. But she was dismayed to\\r\\nfind how quickly her passions leapt forward the moment she sanctioned\\r\\nthis line of thought. Now she was identified with him and rethought his\\r\\nthoughts with complete self-surrender; now, with a sudden cleavage of\\r\\nspirit, she turned upon him and denounced him for his cruelty.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut I refuse--I refuse to hate any one,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said aloud; chose the\\r\\nmoment to cross the road with circumspection, and ten minutes later\\r\\nlunched in the Strand, cutting her meat firmly into small pieces, but\\r\\ngiving her fellow-diners no further cause to judge her eccentric. Her\\r\\nsoliloquy crystallized itself into little fragmentary phrases emerging\\r\\nsuddenly from the turbulence of her thought, particularly when she\\r\\nhad to exert herself in any way, either to move, to count money, or\\r\\nto choose a turning. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTo know the truth--to accept without\\r\\nbitternessÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--those, perhaps, were the most articulate of her utterances,\\r\\nfor no one could have made head or tail of the queer gibberish murmured\\r\\nin front of the statue of Francis, Duke of Bedford, save that the name\\r\\nof Ralph occurred frequently in very strange connections, as if, having\\r\\nspoken it, she wished, superstitiously, to cancel it by adding some\\r\\nother word that robbed the sentence with his name in it of any meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose champions of the cause of women, Mr. Clacton and Mrs. Seal, did\\r\\nnot perceive anything strange in MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s behavior, save that she was\\r\\nalmost half an hour later than usual in coming back to the office.\\r\\nHappily, their own affairs kept them busy, and she was free from their\\r\\ninspection. If they had surprised her they would have found her lost,\\r\\napparently, in admiration of the large hotel across the square, for,\\r\\nafter writing a few words, her pen rested upon the paper, and her mind\\r\\npursued its own journey among the sun-blazoned windows and the drifts of\\r\\npurplish smoke which formed her view. And, indeed, this background was\\r\\nby no means out of keeping with her thoughts. She saw to the remote\\r\\nspaces behind the strife of the foreground, enabled now to gaze there,\\r\\nsince she had renounced her own demands, privileged to see the larger\\r\\nview, to share the vast desires and sufferings of the mass of mankind.\\r\\nShe had been too lately and too roughly mastered by facts to take an\\r\\neasy pleasure in the relief of renunciation; such satisfaction as she\\r\\nfelt came only from the discovery that, having renounced everything\\r\\nthat made life happy, easy, splendid, individual, there remained a hard\\r\\nreality, unimpaired by oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s personal adventures, remote as the stars,\\r\\nunquenchable as they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Mary Datchet was undergoing this curious transformation from the\\r\\nparticular to the universal, Mrs. Seal remembered her duties with regard\\r\\nto the kettle and the gas-fire. She was a little surprised to find that\\r\\nMary had drawn her chair to the window, and, having lit the gas, she\\r\\nraised herself from a stooping posture and looked at her. The most\\r\\nobvious reason for such an attitude in a secretary was some kind of\\r\\nindisposition. But Mary, rousing herself with an effort, denied that she\\r\\nwas indisposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m frightfully lazy this afternoon,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, with a glance at her\\r\\ntable. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou must really get another secretary, Sally.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words were meant to be taken lightly, but something in the tone\\r\\nof them roused a jealous fear which was always dormant in Mrs. SealÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbreast. She was terribly afraid that one of these days Mary, the young\\r\\nwoman who typified so many rather sentimental and enthusiastic ideas,\\r\\nwho had some sort of visionary existence in white with a sheaf of lilies\\r\\nin her hand, would announce, in a jaunty way, that she was about to be\\r\\nmarried.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mean that youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re going to leave us?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve not made up my mind about anything,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary--a remark which\\r\\ncould be taken as a generalization.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Seal got the teacups out of the cupboard and set them on the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not going to be married, are you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked, pronouncing the\\r\\nwords with nervous speed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy are you asking such absurd questions this afternoon, Sally?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary\\r\\nasked, not very steadily. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMust we all get married?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Seal emitted a most peculiar chuckle. She seemed for one moment\\r\\nto acknowledge the terrible side of life which is concerned with the\\r\\nemotions, the private lives, of the sexes, and then to sheer off from it\\r\\nwith all possible speed into the shades of her own shivering virginity.\\r\\nShe was made so uncomfortable by the turn the conversation had taken,\\r\\nthat she plunged her head into the cupboard, and endeavored to abstract\\r\\nsome very obscure piece of china.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe have our work,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, withdrawing her head, displaying cheeks\\r\\nmore than usually crimson, and placing a jam-pot emphatically upon the\\r\\ntable. But, for the moment, she was unable to launch herself upon one of\\r\\nthose enthusiastic, but inconsequent, tirades upon liberty, democracy,\\r\\nthe rights of the people, and the iniquities of the Government, in which\\r\\nshe delighted. Some memory from her own past or from the past of her sex\\r\\nrose to her mind and kept her abashed. She glanced furtively at Mary,\\r\\nwho still sat by the window with her arm upon the sill. She noticed how\\r\\nyoung she was and full of the promise of womanhood. The sight made her\\r\\nso uneasy that she fidgeted the cups upon their saucers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes--enough work to last a lifetime,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, as if concluding some\\r\\npassage of thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Seal brightened at once. She lamented her lack of scientific\\r\\ntraining, and her deficiency in the processes of logic, but she set\\r\\nher mind to work at once to make the prospects of the cause appear\\r\\nas alluring and important as she could. She delivered herself of an\\r\\nharangue in which she asked a great many rhetorical questions and\\r\\nanswered them with a little bang of one fist upon another.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTo last a lifetime? My dear child, it will last all our lifetimes. As\\r\\none falls another steps into the breach. My father, in his generation, a\\r\\npioneer--I, coming after him, do my little best. What, alas! can one do\\r\\nmore? And now itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s you young women--we look to you--the future looks\\r\\nto you. Ah, my dear, if IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d a thousand lives, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d give them all to our\\r\\ncause. The cause of women, dÃ¢\\x80\\x99you say? I say the cause of humanity. And\\r\\nthere are someÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--she glanced fiercely at the window--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwho donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see it!\\r\\nThere are some who are satisfied to go on, year after year, refusing to\\r\\nadmit the truth. And we who have the vision--the kettle boiling over?\\r\\nNo, no, let me see to it--we who know the truth,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued,\\r\\ngesticulating with the kettle and the teapot. Owing to these\\r\\nencumbrances, perhaps, she lost the thread of her discourse, and\\r\\nconcluded, rather wistfully, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all so SIMPLE.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She referred to\\r\\na matter that was a perpetual source of bewilderment to her--the\\r\\nextraordinary incapacity of the human race, in a world where the good\\r\\nis so unmistakably divided from the bad, of distinguishing one from the\\r\\nother, and embodying what ought to be done in a few large, simple Acts\\r\\nof Parliament, which would, in a very short time, completely change the\\r\\nlot of humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOne would have thought,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat men of University training,\\r\\nlike Mr. Asquith--one would have thought that an appeal to reason would\\r\\nnot be unheard by them. But reason,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she reflected, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat is reason\\r\\nwithout Reality?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDoing homage to the phrase, she repeated it once more, and caught the\\r\\near of Mr. Clacton, as he issued from his room; and he repeated it a\\r\\nthird time, giving it, as he was in the habit of doing with Mrs. SealÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nphrases, a dryly humorous intonation. He was well pleased with the\\r\\nworld, however, and he remarked, in a flattering manner, that he would\\r\\nlike to see that phrase in large letters at the head of a leaflet.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut, Mrs. Seal, we have to aim at a judicious combination of the two,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n he added in his magisterial way to check the unbalanced enthusiasm of\\r\\nthe women. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cReality has to be voiced by reason before it can make\\r\\nitself felt. The weak point of all these movements, Miss Datchet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ncontinued, taking his place at the table and turning to Mary as usual\\r\\nwhen about to deliver his more profound cogitations, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis that they\\r\\nare not based upon sufficiently intellectual grounds. A mistake, in\\r\\nmy opinion. The British public likes a pellet of reason in its jam\\r\\nof eloquence--a pill of reason in its pudding of sentiment,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said,\\r\\nsharpening the phrase to a satisfactory degree of literary precision.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes rested, with something of the vanity of an author, upon the\\r\\nyellow leaflet which Mary held in her hand. She rose, took her seat at\\r\\nthe head of the table, poured out tea for her colleagues, and gave\\r\\nher opinion upon the leaflet. So she had poured out tea, so she had\\r\\ncriticized Mr. ClactonÃ¢\\x80\\x99s leaflets a hundred times already; but now\\r\\nit seemed to her that she was doing it in a different spirit; she had\\r\\nenlisted in the army, and was a volunteer no longer. She had renounced\\r\\nsomething and was now--how could she express it?--not quite Ã¢\\x80\\x9cin the\\r\\nrunningÃ¢\\x80\\x9d for life. She had always known that Mr. Clacton and Mrs. Seal\\r\\nwere not in the running, and across the gulf that separated them she\\r\\nhad seen them in the guise of shadow people, flitting in and out of the\\r\\nranks of the living--eccentrics, undeveloped human beings, from whose\\r\\nsubstance some essential part had been cut away. All this had never\\r\\nstruck her so clearly as it did this afternoon, when she felt that\\r\\nher lot was cast with them for ever. One view of the world plunged\\r\\nin darkness, so a more volatile temperament might have argued after\\r\\na season of despair, let the world turn again and show another, more\\r\\nsplendid, perhaps. No, Mary thought, with unflinching loyalty to what\\r\\nappeared to her to be the true view, having lost what is best, I do not\\r\\nmean to pretend that any other view does instead. Whatever happens,\\r\\nI mean to have no presences in my life. Her very words had a sort of\\r\\ndistinctness which is sometimes produced by sharp, bodily pain. To Mrs.\\r\\nSealÃ¢\\x80\\x99s secret jubilation the rule which forbade discussion of shop at\\r\\ntea-time was overlooked. Mary and Mr. Clacton argued with a cogency\\r\\nand a ferocity which made the little woman feel that something very\\r\\nimportant--she hardly knew what--was taking place. She became much\\r\\nexcited; one crucifix became entangled with another, and she dug a\\r\\nconsiderable hole in the table with the point of her pencil in order\\r\\nto emphasize the most striking heads of the discourse; and how any\\r\\ncombination of Cabinet Ministers could resist such discourse she really\\r\\ndid not know.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could hardly bring herself to remember her own private instrument of\\r\\njustice--the typewriter. The telephone-bell rang, and as she hurried off\\r\\nto answer a voice which always seemed a proof of importance by itself,\\r\\nshe felt that it was at this exact spot on the surface of the globe that\\r\\nall the subterranean wires of thought and progress came together. When\\r\\nshe returned, with a message from the printer, she found that Mary was\\r\\nputting on her hat firmly; there was something imperious and dominating\\r\\nin her attitude altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLook, Sally,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthese letters want copying. These IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve not\\r\\nlooked at. The question of the new census will have to be gone into\\r\\ncarefully. But IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m going home now. Good night, Mr. Clacton; good night,\\r\\nSally.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe are very fortunate in our secretary, Mr. Clacton,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Seal,\\r\\npausing with her hand on the papers, as the door shut behind Mary.\\r\\nMr. Clacton himself had been vaguely impressed by something in MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbehavior towards him. He envisaged a time even when it would become\\r\\nnecessary to tell her that there could not be two masters in one\\r\\noffice--but she was certainly able, very able, and in touch with a group\\r\\nof very clever young men. No doubt they had suggested to her some of her\\r\\nnew ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe signified his assent to Mrs. SealÃ¢\\x80\\x99s remark, but observed, with a\\r\\nglance at the clock, which showed only half an hour past five:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf she takes the work seriously, Mrs. Seal--but thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s just what some\\r\\nof your clever young ladies donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d So saying he returned to his\\r\\nroom, and Mrs. Seal, after a momentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s hesitation, hurried back to her\\r\\nlabors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXI\\r\\n\\r\\nMary walked to the nearest station and reached home in an incredibly\\r\\nshort space of time, just so much, indeed, as was needed for the\\r\\nintelligent understanding of the news of the world as the Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWestminster\\r\\nGazetteÃ¢\\x80\\x9d reported it. Within a few minutes of opening her door, she was\\r\\nin trim for a hard eveningÃ¢\\x80\\x99s work. She unlocked a drawer and took out a\\r\\nmanuscript, which consisted of a very few pages, entitled, in a forcible\\r\\nhand, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSome Aspects of the Democratic State.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The aspects dwindled out\\r\\nin a cries-cross of blotted lines in the very middle of a sentence,\\r\\nand suggested that the author had been interrupted, or convinced of the\\r\\nfutility of proceeding, with her pen in the air.... Oh, yes, Ralph had\\r\\ncome in at that point. She scored that sheet very effectively, and,\\r\\nchoosing a fresh one, began at a great rate with a generalization upon\\r\\nthe structure of human society, which was a good deal bolder than her\\r\\ncustom. Ralph had told her once that she couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t write English, which\\r\\naccounted for those frequent blots and insertions; but she put all that\\r\\nbehind her, and drove ahead with such words as came her way, until she\\r\\nhad accomplished half a page of generalization and might legitimately\\r\\ndraw breath. Directly her hand stopped her brain stopped too, and she\\r\\nbegan to listen. A paper-boy shouted down the street; an omnibus ceased\\r\\nand lurched on again with the heave of duty once more shouldered; the\\r\\ndullness of the sounds suggested that a fog had risen since her return,\\r\\nif, indeed, a fog has power to deaden sound, of which fact, she could\\r\\nnot be sure at the present moment. It was the sort of fact Ralph Denham\\r\\nknew. At any rate, it was no concern of hers, and she was about to dip\\r\\na pen when her ear was caught by the sound of a step upon the stone\\r\\nstaircase. She followed it past Mr. ChippenÃ¢\\x80\\x99s chambers; past Mr.\\r\\nGibsonÃ¢\\x80\\x99s; past Mr. TurnerÃ¢\\x80\\x99s; after which it became her sound. A postman,\\r\\na washerwoman, a circular, a bill--she presented herself with each of\\r\\nthese perfectly natural possibilities; but, to her surprise, her mind\\r\\nrejected each one of them impatiently, even apprehensively. The step\\r\\nbecame slow, as it was apt to do at the end of the steep climb, and\\r\\nMary, listening for the regular sound, was filled with an intolerable\\r\\nnervousness. Leaning against the table, she felt the knock of her heart\\r\\npush her body perceptibly backwards and forwards--a state of nerves\\r\\nastonishing and reprehensible in a stable woman. Grotesque fancies took\\r\\nshape. Alone, at the top of the house, an unknown person approaching\\r\\nnearer and nearer--how could she escape? There was no way of escape.\\r\\nShe did not even know whether that oblong mark on the ceiling was a\\r\\ntrap-door to the roof or not. And if she got on to the roof--well, there\\r\\nwas a drop of sixty feet or so on to the pavement. But she sat perfectly\\r\\nstill, and when the knock sounded, she got up directly and opened the\\r\\ndoor without hesitation. She saw a tall figure outside, with something\\r\\nominous to her eyes in the look of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you want?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, not recognizing the face in the fitful\\r\\nlight of the staircase.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMary? IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m Katharine Hilbery!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s self-possession returned almost excessively, and her welcome was\\r\\ndecidedly cold, as if she must recoup herself for this ridiculous\\r\\nwaste of emotion. She moved her green-shaded lamp to another table,\\r\\nand covered Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSome Aspects of the Democratic StateÃ¢\\x80\\x9d with a sheet of\\r\\nblotting-paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t they leave me alone?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought bitterly, connecting\\r\\nKatharine and Ralph in a conspiracy to take from her even this hour of\\r\\nsolitary study, even this poor little defence against the world. And, as\\r\\nshe smoothed down the sheet of blotting-paper over the manuscript,\\r\\nshe braced herself to resist Katharine, whose presence struck her,\\r\\nnot merely by its force, as usual, but as something in the nature of a\\r\\nmenace.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re working?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, with hesitation, perceiving that she\\r\\nwas not welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNothing that matters,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary replied, drawing forward the best of the\\r\\nchairs and poking the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know you had to work after you had left the office,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nKatharine, in a tone which gave the impression that she was thinking of\\r\\nsomething else, as was, indeed, the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had been paying calls with her mother, and in between the calls Mrs.\\r\\nHilbery had rushed into shops and bought pillow-cases and blotting-books\\r\\non no perceptible method for the furnishing of KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s house.\\r\\nKatharine had a sense of impedimenta accumulating on all sides of her.\\r\\nShe had left her at length, and had come on to keep an engagement to\\r\\ndine with Rodney at his rooms. But she did not mean to get to him before\\r\\nseven oÃ¢\\x80\\x99clock, and so had plenty of time to walk all the way from Bond\\r\\nStreet to the Temple if she wished it. The flow of faces streaming\\r\\non either side of her had hypnotized her into a mood of profound\\r\\ndespondency, to which her expectation of an evening alone with Rodney\\r\\ncontributed. They were very good friends again, better friends, they\\r\\nboth said, than ever before. So far as she was concerned this was true.\\r\\nThere were many more things in him than she had guessed until emotion\\r\\nbrought them forth--strength, affection, sympathy. And she thought of\\r\\nthem and looked at the faces passing, and thought how much alike they\\r\\nwere, and how distant, nobody feeling anything as she felt nothing, and\\r\\ndistance, she thought, lay inevitably between the closest, and their\\r\\nintimacy was the worst presence of all. For, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh dear,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought,\\r\\nlooking into a tobacconistÃ¢\\x80\\x99s window, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t care for any of them, and\\r\\nI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t care for William, and people say this is the thing that matters\\r\\nmost, and I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see what they mean by it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked desperately at the smooth-bowled pipes, and wondered--should\\r\\nshe walk on by the Strand or by the Embankment? It was not a simple\\r\\nquestion, for it concerned not different streets so much as different\\r\\nstreams of thought. If she went by the Strand she would force herself\\r\\nto think out the problem of the future, or some mathematical problem;\\r\\nif she went by the river she would certainly begin to think about things\\r\\nthat didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t exist--the forest, the ocean beach, the leafy solitudes,\\r\\nthe magnanimous hero. No, no, no! A thousand times no!--it wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t do;\\r\\nthere was something repulsive in such thoughts at present; she must\\r\\ntake something else; she was out of that mood at present. And then she\\r\\nthought of Mary; the thought gave her confidence, even pleasure of a sad\\r\\nsort, as if the triumph of Ralph and Mary proved that the fault of her\\r\\nfailure lay with herself and not with life. An indistinct idea that the\\r\\nsight of Mary might be of help, combined with her natural trust in her,\\r\\nsuggested a visit; for, surely, her liking was of a kind that implied\\r\\nliking upon MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s side also. After a momentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s hesitation she decided,\\r\\nalthough she seldom acted upon impulse, to act upon this one, and turned\\r\\ndown a side street and found MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s door. But her reception was not\\r\\nencouraging; clearly Mary didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to see her, had no help to impart,\\r\\nand the half-formed desire to confide in her was quenched immediately.\\r\\nShe was slightly amused at her own delusion, looked rather\\r\\nabsent-minded, and swung her gloves to and fro, as if doling out the few\\r\\nminutes accurately before she could say good-by.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose few minutes might very well be spent in asking for information\\r\\nas to the exact position of the Suffrage Bill, or in expounding her own\\r\\nvery sensible view of the situation. But there was a tone in her voice,\\r\\nor a shade in her opinions, or a swing of her gloves which served to\\r\\nirritate Mary Datchet, whose manner became increasingly direct, abrupt,\\r\\nand even antagonistic. She became conscious of a wish to make Katharine\\r\\nrealize the importance of this work, which she discussed so coolly, as\\r\\nthough she, too, had sacrificed what Mary herself had sacrificed. The\\r\\nswinging of the gloves ceased, and Katharine, after ten minutes, began\\r\\nto make movements preliminary to departure. At the sight of this, Mary\\r\\nwas aware--she was abnormally aware of things to-night--of another very\\r\\nstrong desire; Katharine was not to be allowed to go, to disappear into\\r\\nthe free, happy world of irresponsible individuals. She must be made to\\r\\nrealize--to feel.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t quite see,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, as if Katharine had challenged her\\r\\nexplicitly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow, things being as they are, any one can help trying, at\\r\\nleast, to do something.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. But how ARE things?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary pressed her lips, and smiled ironically; she had Katharine at her\\r\\nmercy; she could, if she liked, discharge upon her head wagon-loads\\r\\nof revolting proof of the state of things ignored by the casual, the\\r\\namateur, the looker-on, the cynical observer of life at a distance.\\r\\nAnd yet she hesitated. As usual, when she found herself in talk with\\r\\nKatharine, she began to feel rapid alternations of opinion about\\r\\nher, arrows of sensation striking strangely through the envelope of\\r\\npersonality, which shelters us so conveniently from our fellows. What\\r\\nan egoist, how aloof she was! And yet, not in her words, perhaps, but\\r\\nin her voice, in her face, in her attitude, there were signs of a soft\\r\\nbrooding spirit, of a sensibility unblunted and profound, playing\\r\\nover her thoughts and deeds, and investing her manner with an habitual\\r\\ngentleness. The arguments and phrases of Mr. Clacton fell flat against\\r\\nsuch armor.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be married, and youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll have other things to think of,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said\\r\\ninconsequently, and with an accent of condescension. She was not going\\r\\nto make Katharine understand in a second, as she would, all she herself\\r\\nhad learnt at the cost of such pain. No. Katharine was to be happy;\\r\\nKatharine was to be ignorant; Mary was to keep this knowledge of the\\r\\nimpersonal life for herself. The thought of her morningÃ¢\\x80\\x99s renunciation\\r\\nstung her conscience, and she tried to expand once more into that\\r\\nimpersonal condition which was so lofty and so painless. She must check\\r\\nthis desire to be an individual again, whose wishes were in conflict\\r\\nwith those of other people. She repented of her bitterness.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine now renewed her signs of leave-taking; she had drawn on one of\\r\\nher gloves, and looked about her as if in search of some trivial saying\\r\\nto end with. WasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t there some picture, or clock, or chest of drawers\\r\\nwhich might be singled out for notice? something peaceable and friendly\\r\\nto end the uncomfortable interview? The green-shaded lamp burnt in\\r\\nthe corner, and illumined books and pens and blotting-paper. The whole\\r\\naspect of the place started another train of thought and struck her as\\r\\nenviably free; in such a room one could work--one could have a life of\\r\\noneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s own.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re very lucky,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she observed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI envy you, living alone and\\r\\nhaving your own thingsÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--and engaged in this exalted way, which had no\\r\\nrecognition or engagement-ring, she added in her own mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s lips parted slightly. She could not conceive in what respects\\r\\nKatharine, who spoke sincerely, could envy her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got any reason to envy me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps one always envies other people,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine observed vaguely.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, but youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got everything that any one can want.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine remained silent. She gazed into the fire quietly, and without\\r\\na trace of self-consciousness. The hostility which she had divined in\\r\\nMaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s tone had completely disappeared, and she forgot that she had been\\r\\nupon the point of going.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, I suppose I have,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said at length. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd yet I sometimes\\r\\nthink--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She paused; she did not know how to express what she meant.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt came over me in the Tube the other day,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she resumed, with a smile;\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cwhat is it that makes these people go one way rather than the other?\\r\\nItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not love; itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not reason; I think it must be some idea. Perhaps,\\r\\nMary, our affections are the shadow of an idea. Perhaps there isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t any\\r\\nsuch thing as affection in itself....Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She spoke half-mockingly, asking\\r\\nher question, which she scarcely troubled to frame, not of Mary, or of\\r\\nany one in particular.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the words seemed to Mary Datchet shallow, supercilious,\\r\\ncold-blooded, and cynical all in one. All her natural instincts were\\r\\nroused in revolt against them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m the opposite way of thinking, you see,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes; I know you are,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied, looking at her as if now she\\r\\nwere about, perhaps, to explain something very important.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary could not help feeling the simplicity and good faith that lay\\r\\nbehind KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s words.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think affection is the only reality,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, almost sadly. She understood that Mary was\\r\\nthinking of Ralph, and she felt it impossible to press her to reveal\\r\\nmore of this exalted condition; she could only respect the fact that,\\r\\nin some few cases, life arranged itself thus satisfactorily and pass on.\\r\\nShe rose to her feet accordingly. But Mary exclaimed, with unmistakable\\r\\nearnestness, that she must not go; that they met so seldom; that\\r\\nshe wanted to talk to her so much.... Katharine was surprised at the\\r\\nearnestness with which she spoke. It seemed to her that there could be\\r\\nno indiscretion in mentioning Ralph by name.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeating herself Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor ten minutes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBy the way, Mr. Denham\\r\\ntold me he was going to give up the Bar and live in the country. Has he\\r\\ngone? He was beginning to tell me about it, when we were interrupted.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe thinks of it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary briefly. The color at once came to her\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt would be a very good plan,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine in her decided way.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou think so?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, because he would do something worth while; he would write a book.\\r\\nMy father always says that heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the most remarkable of the young men who\\r\\nwrite for him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary bent low over the fire and stirred the coal between the bars with\\r\\na poker. KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mention of Ralph had roused within her an almost\\r\\nirresistible desire to explain to her the true state of the case\\r\\nbetween herself and Ralph. She knew, from the tone of her voice, that\\r\\nin speaking of Ralph she had no desire to probe MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s secrets, or to\\r\\ninsinuate any of her own. Moreover, she liked Katharine; she trusted\\r\\nher; she felt a respect for her. The first step of confidence was\\r\\ncomparatively simple; but a further confidence had revealed itself, as\\r\\nKatharine spoke, which was not so simple, and yet it impressed itself\\r\\nupon her as a necessity; she must tell Katharine what it was clear that\\r\\nshe had no conception of--she must tell Katharine that Ralph was in love\\r\\nwith her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know what he means to do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said hurriedly, seeking time\\r\\nagainst the pressure of her own conviction. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve not seen him since\\r\\nChristmas.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine reflected that this was odd; perhaps, after all, she had\\r\\nmisunderstood the position. She was in the habit of assuming, however,\\r\\nthat she was rather unobservant of the finer shades of feeling, and she\\r\\nnoted her present failure as another proof that she was a practical,\\r\\nabstract-minded person, better fitted to deal with figures than with the\\r\\nfeelings of men and women. Anyhow, William Rodney would say so.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd now--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, please stay!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary exclaimed, putting out her hand to stop her.\\r\\nDirectly Katharine moved she felt, inarticulately and violently, that\\r\\nshe could not bear to let her go. If Katharine went, her only chance\\r\\nof speaking was lost; her only chance of saying something tremendously\\r\\nimportant was lost. Half a dozen words were sufficient to wake\\r\\nKatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s attention, and put flight and further silence beyond her\\r\\npower. But although the words came to her lips, her throat closed upon\\r\\nthem and drove them back. After all, she considered, why should she\\r\\nspeak? Because it is right, her instinct told her; right to expose\\r\\noneself without reservations to other human beings. She flinched from\\r\\nthe thought. It asked too much of one already stripped bare. Something\\r\\nshe must keep of her own. But if she did keep something of her own?\\r\\nImmediately she figured an immured life, continuing for an immense\\r\\nperiod, the same feelings living for ever, neither dwindling nor\\r\\nchanging within the ring of a thick stone wall. The imagination of this\\r\\nloneliness frightened her, and yet to speak--to lose her loneliness, for\\r\\nit had already become dear to her, was beyond her power.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer hand went down to the hem of KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s skirt, and, fingering a\\r\\nline of fur, she bent her head as if to examine it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI like this fur,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI like your clothes. And you mustnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nthink that IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m going to marry Ralph,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued, in the same tone,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cbecause he doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t care for me at all. He cares for some one else.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Her\\r\\nhead remained bent, and her hand still rested upon the skirt.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a shabby old dress,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, and the only sign that MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwords had reached her was that she spoke with a little jerk.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mind my telling you that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, raising herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re mistaken, arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She was,\\r\\nin truth, horribly uncomfortable, dismayed, indeed, disillusioned. She\\r\\ndisliked the turn things had taken quite intensely. The indecency of\\r\\nit afflicted her. The suffering implied by the tone appalled her. She\\r\\nlooked at Mary furtively, with eyes that were full of apprehension.\\r\\nBut if she had hoped to find that these words had been spoken without\\r\\nunderstanding of their meaning, she was at once disappointed. Mary lay\\r\\nback in her chair, frowning slightly, and looking, Katharine thought, as\\r\\nif she had lived fifteen years or so in the space of a few minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere are some things, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you think, that one canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be mistaken\\r\\nabout?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary said, quietly and almost coldly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThat is what puzzles me\\r\\nabout this question of being in love. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve always prided myself upon\\r\\nbeing reasonable,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think I could have felt this--I\\r\\nmean if the other person didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t. I was foolish. I let myself pretend.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Here she paused. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cFor, you see, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she proceeded, rousing\\r\\nherself and speaking with greater energy, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI AM in love. ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no\\r\\ndoubt about that.... IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m tremendously in love... with Ralph.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The little\\r\\nforward shake of her head, which shook a lock of hair, together with her\\r\\nbrighter color, gave her an appearance at once proud and defiant.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine thought to herself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s how it feels then.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She hesitated,\\r\\nwith a feeling that it was not for her to speak; and then said, in a low\\r\\ntone, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got that. One wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t NOT be in love.... But\\r\\nI didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mean to talk about that; I only wanted you to know. ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nanother thing I want to tell you...Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She paused. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t any\\r\\nauthority from Ralph to say it; but IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure of this--heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s in love with\\r\\nyou.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine looked at her again, as if her first glance must have been\\r\\ndeluded, for, surely, there must be some outward sign that Mary was\\r\\ntalking in an excited, or bewildered, or fantastic manner. No; she still\\r\\nfrowned, as if she sought her way through the clauses of a difficult\\r\\nargument, but she still looked more like one who reasons than one who\\r\\nfeels.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat proves that youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re mistaken--utterly mistaken,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine,\\r\\nspeaking reasonably, too. She had no need to verify the mistake by a\\r\\nglance at her own recollections, when the fact was so clearly stamped\\r\\nupon her mind that if Ralph had any feeling towards her it was one of\\r\\ncritical hostility. She did not give the matter another thought, and\\r\\nMary, now that she had stated the fact, did not seek to prove it, but\\r\\ntried to explain to herself, rather than to Katharine, her motives in\\r\\nmaking the statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had nerved herself to do what some large and imperious instinct\\r\\ndemanded her doing; she had been swept on the breast of a wave beyond\\r\\nher reckoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve told you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbecause I want you to help me. I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want\\r\\nto be jealous of you. And I am--IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m fearfully jealous. The only way, I\\r\\nthought, was to tell you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated, and groped in her endeavor to make her feelings clear to\\r\\nherself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf I tell you, then we can talk; and when IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m jealous, I can tell you.\\r\\nAnd if IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m tempted to do something frightfully mean, I can tell you;\\r\\nyou could make me tell you. I find talking so difficult; but loneliness\\r\\nfrightens me. I should shut it up in my mind. Yes, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nafraid of. Going about with something in my mind all my life that never\\r\\nchanges. I find it so difficult to change. When I think a thingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s wrong\\r\\nI never stop thinking it wrong, and Ralph was quite right, I see, when\\r\\nhe said that thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no such thing as right and wrong; no such thing, I\\r\\nmean, as judging people--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRalph Denham said that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, with considerable indignation.\\r\\nIn order to have produced such suffering in Mary, it seemed to her that\\r\\nhe must have behaved with extreme callousness. It seemed to her that he\\r\\nhad discarded the friendship, when it suited his convenience to do so,\\r\\nwith some falsely philosophical theory which made his conduct all the\\r\\nworse. She was going on to express herself thus, had not Mary at once\\r\\ninterrupted her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand. If thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s any fault itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmine entirely; after all, if one chooses to run risks--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer voice faltered into silence. It was borne in upon her how completely\\r\\nin running her risk she had lost her prize, lost it so entirely that\\r\\nshe had no longer the right, in talking of Ralph, to presume that\\r\\nher knowledge of him supplanted all other knowledge. She no longer\\r\\ncompletely possessed her love, since his share in it was doubtful; and\\r\\nnow, to make things yet more bitter, her clear vision of the way to face\\r\\nlife was rendered tremulous and uncertain, because another was witness\\r\\nof it. Feeling her desire for the old unshared intimacy too great to be\\r\\nborne without tears, she rose, walked to the farther end of the room,\\r\\nheld the curtains apart, and stood there mastered for a moment. The\\r\\ngrief itself was not ignoble; the sting of it lay in the fact that she\\r\\nhad been led to this act of treachery against herself. Trapped, cheated,\\r\\nrobbed, first by Ralph and then by Katharine, she seemed all dissolved\\r\\nin humiliation, and bereft of anything she could call her own. Tears of\\r\\nweakness welled up and rolled down her cheeks. But tears, at least, she\\r\\ncould control, and would this instant, and then, turning, she would face\\r\\nKatharine, and retrieve what could be retrieved of the collapse of her\\r\\ncourage.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned. Katharine had not moved; she was leaning a little forward in\\r\\nher chair and looking into the fire. Something in the attitude reminded\\r\\nMary of Ralph. So he would sit, leaning forward, looking rather fixedly\\r\\nin front of him, while his mind went far away, exploring, speculating,\\r\\nuntil he broke off with his, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Mary?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d--and the silence, that had\\r\\nbeen so full of romance to her, gave way to the most delightful talk\\r\\nthat she had ever known.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething unfamiliar in the pose of the silent figure, something still,\\r\\nsolemn, significant about it, made her hold her breath. She paused. Her\\r\\nthoughts were without bitterness. She was surprised by her own quiet\\r\\nand confidence. She came back silently, and sat once more by KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nside. Mary had no wish to speak. In the silence she seemed to have lost\\r\\nher isolation; she was at once the sufferer and the pitiful spectator of\\r\\nsuffering; she was happier than she had ever been; she was more bereft;\\r\\nshe was rejected, and she was immensely beloved. Attempt to express\\r\\nthese sensations was vain, and, moreover, she could not help believing\\r\\nthat, without any words on her side, they were shared. Thus for some\\r\\ntime longer they sat silent, side by side, while Mary fingered the fur\\r\\non the skirt of the old dress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXII\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that she would be late in keeping her engagement with William\\r\\nwas not the only reason which sent Katharine almost at racing speed\\r\\nalong the Strand in the direction of his rooms. Punctuality might have\\r\\nbeen achieved by taking a cab, had she not wished the open air to\\r\\nfan into flame the glow kindled by MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s words. For among all the\\r\\nimpressions of the eveningÃ¢\\x80\\x99s talk one was of the nature of a revelation\\r\\nand subdued the rest to insignificance. Thus one looked; thus one spoke;\\r\\nsuch was love.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe sat up straight and looked at me, and then she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x98IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m in\\r\\nlove,Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine mused, trying to set the whole scene in motion. It\\r\\nwas a scene to dwell on with so much wonder that not a grain of pity\\r\\noccurred to her; it was a flame blazing suddenly in the dark; by\\r\\nits light Katharine perceived far too vividly for her comfort the\\r\\nmediocrity, indeed the entirely fictitious character of her own feelings\\r\\nso far as they pretended to correspond with MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s feelings. She made up\\r\\nher mind to act instantly upon the knowledge thus gained, and cast\\r\\nher mind in amazement back to the scene upon the heath, when she had\\r\\nyielded, heaven knows why, for reasons which seemed now imperceptible.\\r\\nSo in broad daylight one might revisit the place where one has groped\\r\\nand turned and succumbed to utter bewilderment in a fog.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all so simple,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said to herself. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be any doubt.\\r\\nIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve only got to speak now. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve only got to speak,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went on saying,\\r\\nin time to her own footsteps, and completely forgot Mary Datchet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Rodney, having come back earlier from the office than he\\r\\nexpected, sat down to pick out the melodies in Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe Magic FluteÃ¢\\x80\\x9d upon\\r\\nthe piano. Katharine was late, but that was nothing new, and, as she had\\r\\nno particular liking for music, and he felt in the mood for it, perhaps\\r\\nit was as well. This defect in Katharine was the more strange, William\\r\\nreflected, because, as a rule, the women of her family were unusually\\r\\nmusical. Her cousin, Cassandra Otway, for example, had a very fine taste\\r\\nin music, and he had charming recollections of her in a light fantastic\\r\\nattitude, playing the flute in the morning-room at Stogdon House. He\\r\\nrecalled with pleasure the amusing way in which her nose, long like all\\r\\nthe Otway noses, seemed to extend itself into the flute, as if she were\\r\\nsome inimitably graceful species of musical mole. The little picture\\r\\nsuggested very happily her melodious and whimsical temperament. The\\r\\nenthusiasms of a young girl of distinguished upbringing appealed to\\r\\nWilliam, and suggested a thousand ways in which, with his training and\\r\\naccomplishments, he could be of service to her. She ought to be given\\r\\nthe chance of hearing good music, as it is played by those who have\\r\\ninherited the great tradition. Moreover, from one or two remarks let\\r\\nfall in the course of conversation, he thought it possible that she\\r\\nhad what Katharine professed to lack, a passionate, if untaught,\\r\\nappreciation of literature. He had lent her his play. Meanwhile, as\\r\\nKatharine was certain to be late, and Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe Magic FluteÃ¢\\x80\\x9d is nothing\\r\\nwithout a voice, he felt inclined to spend the time of waiting in\\r\\nwriting a letter to Cassandra, exhorting her to read Pope in preference\\r\\nto Dostoevsky, until her feeling for form was more highly developed. He\\r\\nset himself down to compose this piece of advice in a shape which was\\r\\nlight and playful, and yet did no injury to a cause which he had near\\r\\nat heart, when he heard Katharine upon the stairs. A moment later it was\\r\\nplain that he had been mistaken, it was not Katharine; but he could not\\r\\nsettle himself to his letter. His temper had changed from one of urbane\\r\\ncontentment--indeed of delicious expansion--to one of uneasiness and\\r\\nexpectation. The dinner was brought in, and had to be set by the fire to\\r\\nkeep hot. It was now a quarter of an hour beyond the specified time. He\\r\\nbethought him of a piece of news which had depressed him in the earlier\\r\\npart of the day. Owing to the illness of one of his fellow-clerks, it\\r\\nwas likely that he would get no holiday until later in the year, which\\r\\nwould mean the postponement of their marriage. But this possibility,\\r\\nafter all, was not so disagreeable as the probability which forced\\r\\nitself upon him with every tick of the clock that Katharine had\\r\\ncompletely forgotten her engagement. Such things had happened less\\r\\nfrequently since Christmas, but what if they were going to begin to\\r\\nhappen again? What if their marriage should turn out, as she had said, a\\r\\nfarce? He acquitted her of any wish to hurt him wantonly, but there\\r\\nwas something in her character which made it impossible for her to help\\r\\nhurting people. Was she cold? Was she self-absorbed? He tried to fit her\\r\\nwith each of these descriptions, but he had to own that she puzzled him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere are so many things that she doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he reflected,\\r\\nglancing at the letter to Cassandra which he had begun and laid aside.\\r\\nWhat prevented him from finishing the letter which he had so much\\r\\nenjoyed beginning? The reason was that Katharine might, at any moment,\\r\\nenter the room. The thought, implying his bondage to her, irritated him\\r\\nacutely. It occurred to him that he would leave the letter lying open\\r\\nfor her to see, and he would take the opportunity of telling her that he\\r\\nhad sent his play to Cassandra for her to criticize. Possibly, but not\\r\\nby any means certainly, this would annoy her--and as he reached the\\r\\ndoubtful comfort of this conclusion, there was a knock on the door and\\r\\nKatharine came in. They kissed each other coldly and she made no apology\\r\\nfor being late. Nevertheless, her mere presence moved him strangely;\\r\\nbut he was determined that this should not weaken his resolution to make\\r\\nsome kind of stand against her; to get at the truth about her. He let\\r\\nher make her own disposition of clothes and busied himself with the\\r\\nplates.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got a piece of news for you, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said directly they sat\\r\\ndown to table; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI shanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t get my holiday in April. We shall have to put\\r\\noff our marriage.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rapped the words out with a certain degree of briskness. Katharine\\r\\nstarted a little, as if the announcement disturbed her thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t make any difference, will it? I mean the lease isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nsigned,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut why? What has happened?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told her, in an off-hand way, how one of his fellow-clerks had broken\\r\\ndown, and might have to be away for months, six months even, in which\\r\\ncase they would have to think over their position. He said it in a way\\r\\nwhich struck her, at last, as oddly casual. She looked at him. There was\\r\\nno outward sign that he was annoyed with her. Was she well dressed? She\\r\\nthought sufficiently so. Perhaps she was late? She looked for a clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a good thing we didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t take the house then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she repeated\\r\\nthoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll mean, too, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid, that I shanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be as free for a\\r\\nconsiderable time as I have been,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he continued. She had time to\\r\\nreflect that she gained something by all this, though it was too soon to\\r\\ndetermine what. But the light which had been burning with such intensity\\r\\nas she came along was suddenly overclouded, as much by his manner as by\\r\\nhis news. She had been prepared to meet opposition, which is simple to\\r\\nencounter compared with--she did not know what it was that she had\\r\\nto encounter. The meal passed in quiet, well-controlled talk about\\r\\nindifferent things. Music was not a subject about which she knew\\r\\nanything, but she liked him to tell her things; and could, she mused, as\\r\\nhe talked, fancy the evenings of married life spent thus, over the fire;\\r\\nspent thus, or with a book, perhaps, for then she would have time to\\r\\nread her books, and to grasp firmly with every muscle of her unused mind\\r\\nwhat she longed to know. The atmosphere was very free. Suddenly William\\r\\nbroke off. She looked up apprehensively, brushing aside these thoughts\\r\\nwith annoyance.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhere should I address a letter to Cassandra?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked her. It was\\r\\nobvious again that William had some meaning or other to-night, or was in\\r\\nsome mood. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWeÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve struck up a friendship,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s at home, I think,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey keep her too much at home,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said William. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you ask her\\r\\nto stay with you, and let her hear a little good music? IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll just finish\\r\\nwhat I was saying, if you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mind, because IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m particularly anxious\\r\\nthat she should hear to-morrow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine sank back in her chair, and Rodney took the paper on his\\r\\nknees, and went on with his sentence. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cStyle, you know, is what we tend\\r\\nto neglect--Ã¢\\x80\\x9c; but he was far more conscious of KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eye upon him\\r\\nthan of what he was saying about style. He knew that she was looking at\\r\\nhim, but whether with irritation or indifference he could not guess.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn truth, she had fallen sufficiently into his trap to feel\\r\\nuncomfortably roused and disturbed and unable to proceed on the lines\\r\\nlaid down for herself. This indifferent, if not hostile, attitude\\r\\non WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s part made it impossible to break off without animosity,\\r\\nlargely and completely. Infinitely preferable was MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s state, she\\r\\nthought, where there was a simple thing to do and one did it. In fact,\\r\\nshe could not help supposing that some littleness of nature had a part\\r\\nin all the refinements, reserves, and subtleties of feeling for which\\r\\nher friends and family were so distinguished. For example, although she\\r\\nliked Cassandra well enough, her fantastic method of life struck her as\\r\\npurely frivolous; now it was socialism, now it was silkworms, now it\\r\\nwas music--which last she supposed was the cause of WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sudden\\r\\ninterest in her. Never before had William wasted the minutes of her\\r\\npresence in writing his letters. With a curious sense of light opening\\r\\nwhere all, hitherto, had been opaque, it dawned upon her that, after\\r\\nall, possibly, yes, probably, nay, certainly, the devotion which she had\\r\\nalmost wearily taken for granted existed in a much slighter degree than\\r\\nshe had suspected, or existed no longer. She looked at him attentively\\r\\nas if this discovery of hers must show traces in his face. Never had she\\r\\nseen so much to respect in his appearance, so much that attracted her by\\r\\nits sensitiveness and intelligence, although she saw these qualities as\\r\\nif they were those one responds to, dumbly, in the face of a stranger.\\r\\nThe head bent over the paper, thoughtful as usual, had now a composure\\r\\nwhich seemed somehow to place it at a distance, like a face seen talking\\r\\nto some one else behind glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wrote on, without raising his eyes. She would have spoken, but could\\r\\nnot bring herself to ask him for signs of affection which she had no\\r\\nright to claim. The conviction that he was thus strange to her filled\\r\\nher with despondency, and illustrated quite beyond doubt the infinite\\r\\nloneliness of human beings. She had never felt the truth of this so\\r\\nstrongly before. She looked away into the fire; it seemed to her that\\r\\neven physically they were now scarcely within speaking distance; and\\r\\nspiritually there was certainly no human being with whom she could\\r\\nclaim comradeship; no dream that satisfied her as she was used to be\\r\\nsatisfied; nothing remained in whose reality she could believe, save\\r\\nthose abstract ideas--figures, laws, stars, facts, which she could\\r\\nhardly hold to for lack of knowledge and a kind of shame.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Rodney owned to himself the folly of this prolonged silence, and\\r\\nthe meanness of such devices, and looked up ready to seek some excuse\\r\\nfor a good laugh, or opening for a confession, he was disconcerted by\\r\\nwhat he saw. Katharine seemed equally oblivious of what was bad or\\r\\nof what was good in him. Her expression suggested concentration upon\\r\\nsomething entirely remote from her surroundings. The carelessness of her\\r\\nattitude seemed to him rather masculine than feminine. His impulse to\\r\\nbreak up the constraint was chilled, and once more the exasperating\\r\\nsense of his own impotency returned to him. He could not help\\r\\ncontrasting Katharine with his vision of the engaging, whimsical\\r\\nCassandra; Katharine undemonstrative, inconsiderate, silent, and yet so\\r\\nnotable that he could never do without her good opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe veered round upon him a moment later, as if, when her train of\\r\\nthought was ended, she became aware of his presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you finished your letter?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked. He thought he heard faint\\r\\namusement in her tone, but not a trace of jealousy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not going to write any more to-night,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not in the\\r\\nmood for it for some reason. I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t say what I want to say.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCassandra wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know if itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s well written or badly written,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine\\r\\nremarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not so sure about that. I should say she has a good deal of\\r\\nliterary feeling.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine indifferently. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been neglecting my\\r\\neducation lately, by the way. I wish youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d read something. Let me choose\\r\\na book.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d So speaking, she went across to his bookshelves and began\\r\\nlooking in a desultory way among his books. Anything, she thought, was\\r\\nbetter than bickering or the strange silence which drove home to her the\\r\\ndistance between them. As she pulled one book forward and then another\\r\\nshe thought ironically of her own certainty not an hour ago; how it had\\r\\nvanished in a moment, how she was merely marking time as best she could,\\r\\nnot knowing in the least where they stood, what they felt, or whether\\r\\nWilliam loved her or not. More and more the condition of MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mind\\r\\nseemed to her wonderful and enviable--if, indeed, it could be quite\\r\\nas she figured it--if, indeed, simplicity existed for any one of the\\r\\ndaughters of women.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSwift,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, at last, taking out a volume at haphazard to settle\\r\\nthis question at least. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet us have some Swift.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRodney took the book, held it in front of him, inserted one finger\\r\\nbetween the pages, but said nothing. His face wore a queer expression of\\r\\ndeliberation, as if he were weighing one thing with another, and would\\r\\nnot say anything until his mind were made up.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine, taking her chair beside him, noted his silence and looked at\\r\\nhim with sudden apprehension. What she hoped or feared, she could not\\r\\nhave said; a most irrational and indefensible desire for some assurance\\r\\nof his affection was, perhaps, uppermost in her mind. Peevishness,\\r\\ncomplaints, exacting cross-examination she was used to, but this\\r\\nattitude of composed quiet, which seemed to come from the consciousness\\r\\nof power within, puzzled her. She did not know what was going to happen\\r\\nnext.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last William spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a little odd, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, in a voice of detached\\r\\nreflection. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMost people, I mean, would be seriously upset if their\\r\\nmarriage was put off for six months or so. But we arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t; now how do you\\r\\naccount for that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him and observed his judicial attitude as of one holding\\r\\nfar aloof from emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI attribute it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he went on, without waiting for her to answer, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto the\\r\\nfact that neither of us is in the least romantic about the other. That\\r\\nmay be partly, no doubt, because weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve known each other so long; but\\r\\nIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m inclined to think thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s more in it than that. ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s something\\r\\ntemperamental. I think youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re a trifle cold, and I suspect IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m a trifle\\r\\nself-absorbed. If that were so it goes a long way to explaining our\\r\\nodd lack of illusion about each other. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not saying that the most\\r\\nsatisfactory marriages arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t founded upon this sort of understanding.\\r\\nBut certainly it struck me as odd this morning, when Wilson told me,\\r\\nhow little upset I felt. By the way, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re sure we havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t committed\\r\\nourselves to that house?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve kept the letters, and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll go through them to-morrow; but IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m\\r\\ncertain weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re on the safe side.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThanks. As to the psychological problem,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he continued, as if the\\r\\nquestion interested him in a detached way, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no doubt, I think,\\r\\nthat either of us is capable of feeling what, for reasons of simplicity,\\r\\nI call romance for a third person--at least, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve little doubt in my own\\r\\ncase.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, perhaps, the first time in all her knowledge of him that\\r\\nKatharine had known William enter thus deliberately and without sign of\\r\\nemotion upon a statement of his own feelings. He was wont to discourage\\r\\nsuch intimate discussions by a little laugh or turn of the conversation,\\r\\nas much as to say that men, or men of the world, find such topics\\r\\na little silly, or in doubtful taste. His obvious wish to explain\\r\\nsomething puzzled her, interested her, and neutralized the wound to her\\r\\nvanity. For some reason, too, she felt more at ease with him than usual;\\r\\nor her ease was more the ease of equality--she could not stop to think\\r\\nof that at the moment though. His remarks interested her too much for\\r\\nthe light that they threw upon certain problems of her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is this romance?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she mused.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the question. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve never come across a definition that\\r\\nsatisfied me, though there are some very good onesÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--he glanced in the\\r\\ndirection of his books.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not altogether knowing the other person, perhaps--itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s ignorance,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she hazarded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSome authorities say itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a question of distance--romance in\\r\\nliterature, that is--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPossibly, in the case of art. But in the case of people it may be--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you no personal experience of it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked, letting his eyes rest\\r\\nupon her swiftly for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI believe itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s influenced me enormously,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, in the tone of one\\r\\nabsorbed by the possibilities of some view just presented to them; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut\\r\\nin my life thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s so little scope for it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added. She reviewed her\\r\\ndaily task, the perpetual demands upon her for good sense, self-control,\\r\\nand accuracy in a house containing a romantic mother. Ah, but her\\r\\nromance wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t THAT romance. It was a desire, an echo, a sound; she\\r\\ncould drape it in color, see it in form, hear it in music, but not in\\r\\nwords; no, never in words. She sighed, teased by desires so incoherent,\\r\\nso incommunicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it curious,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William resumed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat you should neither feel\\r\\nit for me, nor I for you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine agreed that it was curious--very; but even more curious to\\r\\nher was the fact that she was discussing the question with William. It\\r\\nrevealed possibilities which opened a prospect of a new relationship\\r\\naltogether. Somehow it seemed to her that he was helping her to\\r\\nunderstand what she had never understood; and in her gratitude she was\\r\\nconscious of a most sisterly desire to help him, too--sisterly, save for\\r\\none pang, not quite to be subdued, that for him she was without romance.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think you might be very happy with some one you loved in that way,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou assume that romance survives a closer knowledge of the person one\\r\\nloves?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe asked the question formally, to protect himself from the sort of\\r\\npersonality which he dreaded. The whole situation needed the most\\r\\ncareful management lest it should degenerate into some degrading and\\r\\ndisturbing exhibition such as the scene, which he could never think\\r\\nof without shame, upon the heath among the dead leaves. And yet each\\r\\nsentence brought him relief. He was coming to understand something or\\r\\nother about his own desires hitherto undefined by him, the source of his\\r\\ndifficulty with Katharine. The wish to hurt her, which had urged him to\\r\\nbegin, had completely left him, and he felt that it was only Katharine\\r\\nnow who could help him to be sure. He must take his time. There were so\\r\\nmany things that he could not say without the greatest difficulty--that\\r\\nname, for example, Cassandra. Nor could he move his eyes from a certain\\r\\nspot, a fiery glen surrounded by high mountains, in the heart of the\\r\\ncoals. He waited in suspense for Katharine to continue. She had said\\r\\nthat he might be very happy with some one he loved in that way.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see why it shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t last with you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she resumed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI can\\r\\nimagine a certain sort of person--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she paused; she was aware that he\\r\\nwas listening with the greatest intentness, and that his formality was\\r\\nmerely the cover for an extreme anxiety of some sort. There was some\\r\\nperson then--some woman--who could it be? Cassandra? Ah, possibly--\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA person,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, speaking in the most matter-of-fact tone she\\r\\ncould command, Ã¢\\x80\\x9clike Cassandra Otway, for instance. Cassandra is the\\r\\nmost interesting of the Otways--with the exception of Henry. Even so,\\r\\nI like Cassandra better. She has more than mere cleverness. She is a\\r\\ncharacter--a person by herself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThose dreadful insects!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d burst from William, with a nervous laugh, and\\r\\na little spasm went through him as Katharine noticed. It WAS Cassandra\\r\\nthen. Automatically and dully she replied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou could insist that she\\r\\nconfined herself to--to--something else.... But she cares for music;\\r\\nI believe she writes poetry; and there can be no doubt that she has a\\r\\npeculiar charm--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe ceased, as if defining to herself this peculiar charm. After a\\r\\nmomentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s silence William jerked out:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI thought her affectionate?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cExtremely affectionate. She worships Henry. When you think what a house\\r\\nthat is--Uncle Francis always in one mood or another--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDear, dear, dear,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William muttered.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd you have so much in common.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear Katharine!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William exclaimed, flinging himself back in his\\r\\nchair, and uprooting his eyes from the spot in the fire. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI really donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nknow what weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re talking about.... I assure you....Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was covered with an extreme confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe withdrew the finger that was still thrust between the pages of\\r\\nGulliver, opened the book, and ran his eye down the list of chapters, as\\r\\nthough he were about to select the one most suitable for reading aloud.\\r\\nAs Katharine watched him, she was seized with preliminary symptoms of\\r\\nhis own panic. At the same time she was convinced that, should he find\\r\\nthe right page, take out his spectacles, clear his throat, and open his\\r\\nlips, a chance that would never come again in all their lives would be\\r\\nlost to them both.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWeÃ¢\\x80\\x99re talking about things that interest us both very much,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t we go on talking, and leave Swift for another time? I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t feel\\r\\nin the mood for Swift, and itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a pity to read any one when thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the\\r\\ncase--particularly Swift.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presence of wise literary speculation, as she calculated, restored\\r\\nWilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s confidence in his security, and he replaced the book in\\r\\nthe bookcase, keeping his back turned to her as he did so, and taking\\r\\nadvantage of this circumstance to summon his thoughts together.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a second of introspection had the alarming result of showing him\\r\\nthat his mind, when looked at from within, was no longer familiar\\r\\nground. He felt, that is to say, what he had never consciously felt\\r\\nbefore; he was revealed to himself as other than he was wont to think\\r\\nhim; he was afloat upon a sea of unknown and tumultuous possibilities.\\r\\nHe paced once up and down the room, and then flung himself impetuously\\r\\ninto the chair by KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s side. He had never felt anything like\\r\\nthis before; he put himself entirely into her hands; he cast off all\\r\\nresponsibility. He very nearly exclaimed aloud:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve stirred up all these odious and violent emotions, and now you\\r\\nmust do the best you can with them.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer near presence, however, had a calming and reassuring effect upon his\\r\\nagitation, and he was conscious only of an implicit trust that, somehow,\\r\\nhe was safe with her, that she would see him through, find out what it\\r\\nwas that he wanted, and procure it for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wish to do whatever you tell me to do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI put myself\\r\\nentirely in your hands, Katharine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou must try to tell me what you feel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear, I feel a thousand things every second. I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure,\\r\\nwhat I feel. That afternoon on the heath--it was then--then--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He broke\\r\\noff; he did not tell her what had happened then. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYour ghastly good\\r\\nsense, as usual, has convinced me--for the moment--but what the truth\\r\\nis, Heaven only knows!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIsnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it the truth that you are, or might be, in love with Cassandra?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she said gently.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam bowed his head. After a momentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s silence he murmured:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI believe youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re right, Katharine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sighed, involuntarily. She had been hoping all this time, with an\\r\\nintensity that increased second by second against the current of her\\r\\nwords, that it would not in the end come to this. After a moment of\\r\\nsurprising anguish, she summoned her courage to tell him how she wished\\r\\nonly that she might help him, and had framed the first words of\\r\\nher speech when a knock, terrific and startling to people in their\\r\\noverwrought condition, sounded upon the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine, I worship you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he urged, half in a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied, withdrawing with a little shiver, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut you must open\\r\\nthe door.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Ralph Denham entered the room and saw Katharine seated with her\\r\\nback to him, he was conscious of a change in the grade of the atmosphere\\r\\nsuch as a traveler meets with sometimes upon the roads, particularly\\r\\nafter sunset, when, without warning, he runs from clammy chill to a\\r\\nhoard of unspent warmth in which the sweetness of hay and beanfield\\r\\nis cherished, as if the sun still shone although the moon is up. He\\r\\nhesitated; he shuddered; he walked elaborately to the window and laid\\r\\naside his coat. He balanced his stick most carefully against the folds\\r\\nof the curtain. Thus occupied with his own sensations and preparations,\\r\\nhe had little time to observe what either of the other two was feeling.\\r\\nSuch symptoms of agitation as he might perceive (and they had left their\\r\\ntokens in brightness of eye and pallor of cheeks) seemed to him well\\r\\nbefitting the actors in so great a drama as that of Katharine HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndaily life. Beauty and passion were the breath of her being, he thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe scarcely noticed his presence, or only as it forced her to adopt a\\r\\nmanner of composure, which she was certainly far from feeling. William,\\r\\nhowever, was even more agitated than she was, and her first instalment\\r\\nof promised help took the form of some commonplace upon the age of the\\r\\nbuilding or the architectÃ¢\\x80\\x99s name, which gave him an excuse to fumble in\\r\\na drawer for certain designs, which he laid upon the table between the\\r\\nthree of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich of the three followed the designs most carefully it would be\\r\\ndifficult to tell, but it is certain that not one of the three found for\\r\\nthe moment anything to say. Years of training in a drawing-room came at\\r\\nlength to KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s help, and she said something suitable, at the same\\r\\nmoment withdrawing her hand from the table because she perceived that it\\r\\ntrembled. William agreed effusively; Denham corroborated him, speaking\\r\\nin rather high-pitched tones; they thrust aside the plans, and drew\\r\\nnearer to the fireplace.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99d rather live here than anywhere in the whole of London,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nDenham.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got nowhere to liveÃ¢\\x80\\x9d) Katharine thought, as she agreed aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou could get rooms here, no doubt, if you wanted to,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m just leaving London for good--IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve taken that cottage I was\\r\\ntelling you about.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The announcement seemed to convey very little to\\r\\neither of his hearers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIndeed?--thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sad.... You must give me your address. But you wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ncut yourself off altogether, surely--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be moving, too, I suppose,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam showed such visible signs of floundering that Katharine\\r\\ncollected herself and asked:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhere is the cottage youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve taken?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn answering her, Denham turned and looked at her. As their eyes met,\\r\\nshe realized for the first time that she was talking to Ralph Denham,\\r\\nand she remembered, without recalling any details, that she had been\\r\\nspeaking of him quite lately, and that she had reason to think ill of\\r\\nhim. What Mary had said she could not remember, but she felt that\\r\\nthere was a mass of knowledge in her mind which she had not had time\\r\\nto examine--knowledge now lying on the far side of a gulf. But her\\r\\nagitation flashed the queerest lights upon her past. She must get\\r\\nthrough the matter in hand, and then think it out in quiet. She bent\\r\\nher mind to follow what Ralph was saying. He was telling her that he had\\r\\ntaken a cottage in Norfolk, and she was saying that she knew, or did not\\r\\nknow, that particular neighborhood. But after a momentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s attention her\\r\\nmind flew to Rodney, and she had an unusual, indeed unprecedented, sense\\r\\nthat they were in touch and shared each otherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s thoughts. If only\\r\\nRalph were not there, she would at once give way to her desire to take\\r\\nWilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s hand, then to bend his head upon her shoulder, for this was\\r\\nwhat she wanted to do more than anything at the moment, unless, indeed,\\r\\nshe wished more than anything to be alone--yes, that was what she\\r\\nwanted. She was sick to death of these discussions; she shivered at the\\r\\neffort to reveal her feelings. She had forgotten to answer. William was\\r\\nspeaking now.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut what will you find to do in the country?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked at random,\\r\\nstriking into a conversation which she had only half heard, in such\\r\\na way as to make both Rodney and Denham look at her with a little\\r\\nsurprise. But directly she took up the conversation, it was WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nturn to fall silent. He at once forgot to listen to what they were\\r\\nsaying, although he interposed nervously at intervals, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, yes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n As the minutes passed, RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s presence became more and more intolerable\\r\\nto him, since there was so much that he must say to Katharine; the\\r\\nmoment he could not talk to her, terrible doubts, unanswerable questions\\r\\naccumulated, which he must lay before Katharine, for she alone could\\r\\nhelp him now. Unless he could see her alone, it would be impossible for\\r\\nhim ever to sleep, or to know what he had said in a moment of madness,\\r\\nwhich was not altogether mad, or was it mad? He nodded his head, and\\r\\nsaid, nervously, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes, yes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and looked at Katharine, and thought how\\r\\nbeautiful she looked; there was no one in the world that he admired\\r\\nmore. There was an emotion in her face which lent it an expression he\\r\\nhad never seen there. Then, as he was turning over means by which he\\r\\ncould speak to her alone, she rose, and he was taken by surprise, for he\\r\\nhad counted on the fact that she would outstay Denham. His only chance,\\r\\nthen, of saying something to her in private, was to take her downstairs\\r\\nand walk with her to the street. While he hesitated, however, overcome\\r\\nwith the difficulty of putting one simple thought into words when\\r\\nall his thoughts were scattered about, and all were too strong for\\r\\nutterance, he was struck silent by something that was still more\\r\\nunexpected. Denham got up from his chair, looked at Katharine, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m going, too. Shall we go together?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd before William could see any way of detaining him--or would it\\r\\nbe better to detain Katharine?--he had taken his hat, stick, and was\\r\\nholding the door open for Katharine to pass out. The most that William\\r\\ncould do was to stand at the head of the stairs and say good-night. He\\r\\ncould not offer to go with them. He could not insist that she should\\r\\nstay. He watched her descend, rather slowly, owing to the dusk of the\\r\\nstaircase, and he had a last sight of DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s head and of KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhead near together, against the panels, when suddenly a pang of acute\\r\\njealousy overcame him, and had he not remained conscious of the slippers\\r\\nupon his feet, he would have run after them or cried out. As it was he\\r\\ncould not move from the spot. At the turn of the staircase Katharine\\r\\nturned to look back, trusting to this last glance to seal their compact\\r\\nof good friendship. Instead of returning her silent greeting, William\\r\\ngrinned back at her a cold stare of sarcasm or of rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stopped dead for a moment, and then descended slowly into the court.\\r\\nShe looked to the right and to the left, and once up into the sky. She\\r\\nwas only conscious of Denham as a block upon her thoughts. She measured\\r\\nthe distance that must be traversed before she would be alone. But when\\r\\nthey came to the Strand no cabs were to be seen, and Denham broke the\\r\\nsilence by saying:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere seem to be no cabs. Shall we walk on a little?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery well,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she agreed, paying no attention to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAware of her preoccupation, or absorbed in his own thoughts, Ralph said\\r\\nnothing further; and in silence they walked some distance along the\\r\\nStrand. Ralph was doing his best to put his thoughts into such order\\r\\nthat one came before the rest, and the determination that when he spoke\\r\\nhe should speak worthily, made him put off the moment of speaking till\\r\\nhe had found the exact words and even the place that best suited him.\\r\\nThe Strand was too busy. There was too much risk, also, of finding an\\r\\nempty cab. Without a word of explanation he turned to the left, down one\\r\\nof the side streets leading to the river. On no account must they part\\r\\nuntil something of the very greatest importance had happened. He knew\\r\\nperfectly well what he wished to say, and had arranged not only the\\r\\nsubstance, but the order in which he was to say it. Now, however, that\\r\\nhe was alone with her, not only did he find the difficulty of speaking\\r\\nalmost insurmountable, but he was aware that he was angry with her for\\r\\nthus disturbing him, and casting, as it was so easy for a person of her\\r\\nadvantages to do, these phantoms and pitfalls across his path. He was\\r\\ndetermined that he would question her as severely as he would question\\r\\nhimself; and make them both, once and for all, either justify her\\r\\ndominance or renounce it. But the longer they walked thus alone, the\\r\\nmore he was disturbed by the sense of her actual presence. Her skirt\\r\\nblew; the feathers in her hat waved; sometimes he saw her a step or two\\r\\nahead of him, or had to wait for her to catch him up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe silence was prolonged, and at length drew her attention to him.\\r\\nFirst she was annoyed that there was no cab to free her from his\\r\\ncompany; then she recalled vaguely something that Mary had said to make\\r\\nher think ill of him; she could not remember what, but the recollection,\\r\\ncombined with his masterful ways--why did he walk so fast down this side\\r\\nstreet?--made her more and more conscious of a person of marked, though\\r\\ndisagreeable, force by her side. She stopped and, looking round her\\r\\nfor a cab, sighted one in the distance. He was thus precipitated into\\r\\nspeech.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShould you mind if we walked a little farther?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsomething I want to say to you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery well,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied, guessing that his request had something to do\\r\\nwith Mary Datchet.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s quieter by the river,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, and instantly he crossed over. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nwant to ask you merely this,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he began. But he paused so long that she\\r\\ncould see his head against the sky; the slope of his thin cheek and\\r\\nhis large, strong nose were clearly marked against it. While he paused,\\r\\nwords that were quite different from those he intended to use presented\\r\\nthemselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve made you my standard ever since I saw you. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve dreamt about you;\\r\\nIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve thought of nothing but you; you represent to me the only reality in\\r\\nthe world.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis words, and the queer strained voice in which he spoke them, made it\\r\\nappear as if he addressed some person who was not the woman beside him,\\r\\nbut some one far away.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd now things have come to such a pass that, unless I can speak to you\\r\\nopenly, I believe I shall go mad. I think of you as the most beautiful,\\r\\nthe truest thing in the world,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he continued, filled with a sense of\\r\\nexaltation, and feeling that he had no need now to choose his words with\\r\\npedantic accuracy, for what he wanted to say was suddenly become plain\\r\\nto him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI see you everywhere, in the stars, in the river; to me youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re\\r\\neverything that exists; the reality of everything. Life, I tell you,\\r\\nwould be impossible without you. And now I want--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had heard him so far with a feeling that she had dropped some\\r\\nmaterial word which made sense of the rest. She could hear no more of\\r\\nthis unintelligible rambling without checking him. She felt that she was\\r\\noverhearing what was meant for another.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re saying things that you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nmean.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI mean every word I say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied, emphatically. He turned his head\\r\\ntowards her. She recovered the words she was searching for while he\\r\\nspoke. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cRalph Denham is in love with you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d They came back to her in Mary\\r\\nDatchetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s voice. Her anger blazed up in her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI saw Mary Datchet this afternoon,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made a movement as if he were surprised or taken aback, but answered\\r\\nin a moment:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe told you that I had asked her to marry me, I suppose?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine exclaimed, in surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI did though. It was the day I saw you at Lincoln,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he continued. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nhad meant to ask her to marry me, and then I looked out of the window\\r\\nand saw you. After that I didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to ask any one to marry me. But\\r\\nI did it; and she knew I was lying, and refused me. I thought then, and\\r\\nstill think, that she cares for me. I behaved very badly. I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t defend\\r\\nmyself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should hope not. ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no defence that I can\\r\\nthink of. If any conduct is wrong, that is.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She spoke with an energy\\r\\nthat was directed even more against herself than against him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt seems\\r\\nto me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued, with the same energy, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat people are bound\\r\\nto be honest. ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no excuse for such behavior.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She could now see\\r\\nplainly before her eyes the expression on Mary DatchetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s face.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a short pause, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am not telling you that I am in love with you. I am not in love with\\r\\nyou.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied, conscious of some bewilderment.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have not spoken a word to you that I do not mean,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTell me then what it is that you mean,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said at length.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if obeying a common instinct, they both stopped and, bending slightly\\r\\nover the balustrade of the river, looked into the flowing water.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou say that weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got to be honest,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph began. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cVery well. I will\\r\\ntry to tell you the facts; but I warn you, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll think me mad. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a\\r\\nfact, though, that since I first saw you four or five months ago I\\r\\nhave made you, in an utterly absurd way, I expect, my ideal. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m almost\\r\\nashamed to tell you what lengths IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve gone to. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s become the thing\\r\\nthat matters most in my life.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He checked himself. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWithout knowing you,\\r\\nexcept that youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re beautiful, and all that, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve come to believe that\\r\\nweÃ¢\\x80\\x99re in some sort of agreement; that weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re after something together;\\r\\nthat we see something.... IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got into the habit of imagining you; IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nalways thinking what youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d say or do; I walk along the street talking\\r\\nto you; I dream of you. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s merely a bad habit, a schoolboy habit,\\r\\nday-dreaming; itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a common experience; half oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s friends do the same;\\r\\nwell, those are the facts.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSimultaneously, they both walked on very slowly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you were to know me you would feel none of this,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe\\r\\ndonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know each other--weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve always been--interrupted.... Were you going\\r\\nto tell me this that day my aunts came?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked, recollecting the\\r\\nwhole scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bowed his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe day you told me of your engagement,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe thought, with a start, that she was no longer engaged.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI deny that I should cease to feel this if I knew you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he went on. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nshould feel it more reasonably--thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all. I shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t talk the kind\\r\\nof nonsense IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve talked to-night.... But it wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t nonsense. It was the\\r\\ntruth,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said doggedly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the important thing. You can force me\\r\\nto talk as if this feeling for you were an hallucination, but all our\\r\\nfeelings are that. The best of them are half illusions. Still,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nadded, as if arguing to himself, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif it werenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t as real a feeling as IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m\\r\\ncapable of, I shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be changing my life on your account.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI told you. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m taking a cottage. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m giving up my profession.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOn my account?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked, in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, on your account,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied. He explained his meaning no further.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know you or your circumstances,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said at last, as he\\r\\nremained silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou have no opinion about me one way or the other?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I suppose I have an opinion--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe controlled his wish to ask her to explain herself, and much to his\\r\\npleasure she went on, appearing to search her mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI thought that you criticized me--perhaps disliked me. I thought of you\\r\\nas a person who judges--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo; IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m a person who feels,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, in a low voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTell me, then, what has made you do this?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked, after a break.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told her in an orderly way, betokening careful preparation, all that\\r\\nhe had meant to say at first; how he stood with regard to his brothers\\r\\nand sisters; what his mother had said, and his sister Joan had refrained\\r\\nfrom saying; exactly how many pounds stood in his name at the bank; what\\r\\nprospect his brother had of earning a livelihood in America; how much of\\r\\ntheir income went on rent, and other details known to him by heart. She\\r\\nlistened to all this, so that she could have passed an examination in\\r\\nit by the time Waterloo Bridge was in sight; and yet she was no more\\r\\nlistening to it than she was counting the paving-stones at her feet. She\\r\\nwas feeling happier than she had felt in her life. If Denham could have\\r\\nseen how visibly books of algebraic symbols, pages all speckled with\\r\\ndots and dashes and twisted bars, came before her eyes as they trod the\\r\\nEmbankment, his secret joy in her attention might have been dispersed.\\r\\nShe went on, saying, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I see.... But how would that help you?...\\r\\nYour brother has passed his examination?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d so sensibly, that he had\\r\\nconstantly to keep his brain in check; and all the time she was in fancy\\r\\nlooking up through a telescope at white shadow-cleft disks which were\\r\\nother worlds, until she felt herself possessed of two bodies, one\\r\\nwalking by the river with Denham, the other concentrated to a silver\\r\\nglobe aloft in the fine blue space above the scum of vapors that was\\r\\ncovering the visible world. She looked at the sky once, and saw that no\\r\\nstar was keen enough to pierce the flight of watery clouds now coursing\\r\\nrapidly before the west wind. She looked down hurriedly again. There was\\r\\nno reason, she assured herself, for this feeling of happiness; she was\\r\\nnot free; she was not alone; she was still bound to earth by a million\\r\\nfibres; every step took her nearer home. Nevertheless, she exulted\\r\\nas she had never exulted before. The air was fresher, the lights more\\r\\ndistinct, the cold stone of the balustrade colder and harder, when\\r\\nby chance or purpose she struck her hand against it. No feeling of\\r\\nannoyance with Denham remained; he certainly did not hinder any flight\\r\\nshe might choose to make, whether in the direction of the sky or of her\\r\\nhome; but that her condition was due to him, or to anything that he had\\r\\nsaid, she had no consciousness at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were now within sight of the stream of cabs and omnibuses crossing\\r\\nto and from the Surrey side of the river; the sound of the traffic, the\\r\\nhooting of motor-horns, and the light chime of tram-bells sounded more\\r\\nand more distinctly, and, with the increase of noise, they both became\\r\\nsilent. With a common instinct they slackened their pace, as if to\\r\\nlengthen the time of semi-privacy allowed them. To Ralph, the pleasure\\r\\nof these last yards of the walk with Katharine was so great that he\\r\\ncould not look beyond the present moment to the time when she should\\r\\nhave left him. He had no wish to use the last moments of their\\r\\ncompanionship in adding fresh words to what he had already said. Since\\r\\nthey had stopped talking, she had become to him not so much a real\\r\\nperson, as the very woman he dreamt of; but his solitary dreams had\\r\\nnever produced any such keenness of sensation as that which he felt\\r\\nin her presence. He himself was also strangely transfigured. He had\\r\\ncomplete mastery of all his faculties. For the first time he was in\\r\\npossession of his full powers. The vistas which opened before him seemed\\r\\nto have no perceptible end. But the mood had none of the restlessness or\\r\\nfeverish desire to add one delight to another which had hitherto marked,\\r\\nand somewhat spoilt, the most rapturous of his imaginings. It was a mood\\r\\nthat took such clear-eyed account of the conditions of human life that\\r\\nhe was not disturbed in the least by the gliding presence of a taxicab,\\r\\nand without agitation he perceived that Katharine was conscious of\\r\\nit also, and turned her head in that direction. Their halting steps\\r\\nacknowledged the desirability of engaging the cab; and they stopped\\r\\nsimultaneously, and signed to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen you will let me know your decision as soon as you can?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked,\\r\\nwith his hand on the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hesitated for a moment. She could not immediately recall what the\\r\\nquestion was that she had to decide.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI will write,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said vaguely. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, in a second,\\r\\nbethinking her of the difficulties of writing anything decided upon a\\r\\nquestion to which she had paid no attention, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see how to manage\\r\\nit.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stood looking at Denham, considering and hesitating, with her foot\\r\\nupon the step. He guessed her difficulties; he knew in a second that she\\r\\nhad heard nothing; he knew everything that she felt.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s only one place to discuss things satisfactorily that I know\\r\\nof,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said quickly; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Kew.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKew?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKew,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated, with immense decision. He shut the door and gave her\\r\\naddress to the driver. She instantly was conveyed away from him, and her\\r\\ncab joined the knotted stream of vehicles, each marked by a light, and\\r\\nindistinguishable one from the other. He stood watching for a moment,\\r\\nand then, as if swept by some fierce impulse, from the spot where they\\r\\nhad stood, he turned, crossed the road at a rapid pace, and disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked on upon the impetus of this last mood of almost supernatural\\r\\nexaltation until he reached a narrow street, at this hour empty of\\r\\ntraffic and passengers. Here, whether it was the shops with their\\r\\nshuttered windows, the smooth and silvered curve of the wood pavement,\\r\\nor a natural ebb of feeling, his exaltation slowly oozed and deserted\\r\\nhim. He was now conscious of the loss that follows any revelation; he\\r\\nhad lost something in speaking to Katharine, for, after all, was\\r\\nthe Katharine whom he loved the same as the real Katharine? She had\\r\\ntranscended her entirely at moments; her skirt had blown, her feather\\r\\nwaved, her voice spoken; yes, but how terrible sometimes the pause\\r\\nbetween the voice of oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s dreams and the voice that comes from the\\r\\nobject of oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s dreams! He felt a mixture of disgust and pity at the\\r\\nfigure cut by human beings when they try to carry out, in practice, what\\r\\nthey have the power to conceive. How small both he and Katharine had\\r\\nappeared when they issued from the cloud of thought that enveloped them!\\r\\nHe recalled the small, inexpressive, commonplace words in which they had\\r\\ntried to communicate with each other; he repeated them over to himself.\\r\\nBy repeating KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s words, he came in a few moments to such a\\r\\nsense of her presence that he worshipped her more than ever. But she was\\r\\nengaged to be married, he remembered with a start. The strength of his\\r\\nfeeling was revealed to him instantly, and he gave himself up to an\\r\\nirresistible rage and sense of frustration. The image of Rodney came\\r\\nbefore him with every circumstance of folly and indignity. That little\\r\\npink-cheeked dancing-master to marry Katharine? that gibbering ass with\\r\\nthe face of a monkey on an organ? that posing, vain, fantastical fop?\\r\\nwith his tragedies and his comedies, his innumerable spites and prides\\r\\nand pettinesses? Lord! marry Rodney! She must be as great a fool as he\\r\\nwas. His bitterness took possession of him, and as he sat in the\\r\\ncorner of the underground carriage, he looked as stark an image of\\r\\nunapproachable severity as could be imagined. Directly he reached home\\r\\nhe sat down at his table, and began to write Katharine a long, wild, mad\\r\\nletter, begging her for both their sakes to break with Rodney, imploring\\r\\nher not to do what would destroy for ever the one beauty, the one truth,\\r\\nthe one hope; not to be a traitor, not to be a deserter, for if she\\r\\nwere--and he wound up with a quiet and brief assertion that, whatever\\r\\nshe did or left undone, he would believe to be the best, and accept from\\r\\nher with gratitude. He covered sheet after sheet, and heard the early\\r\\ncarts starting for London before he went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first signs of spring, even such as make themselves felt towards the\\r\\nmiddle of February, not only produce little white and violet flowers\\r\\nin the more sheltered corners of woods and gardens, but bring to birth\\r\\nthoughts and desires comparable to those faintly colored and sweetly\\r\\nscented petals in the minds of men and women. Lives frozen by age,\\r\\nso far as the present is concerned, to a hard surface, which neither\\r\\nreflects nor yields, at this season become soft and fluid, reflecting\\r\\nthe shapes and colors of the present, as well as the shapes and colors\\r\\nof the past. In the case of Mrs. Hilbery, these early spring days were\\r\\nchiefly upsetting inasmuch as they caused a general quickening of her\\r\\nemotional powers, which, as far as the past was concerned, had never\\r\\nsuffered much diminution. But in the spring her desire for expression\\r\\ninvariably increased. She was haunted by the ghosts of phrases. She gave\\r\\nherself up to a sensual delight in the combinations of words. She sought\\r\\nthem in the pages of her favorite authors. She made them for herself\\r\\non scraps of paper, and rolled them on her tongue when there seemed no\\r\\noccasion for such eloquence. She was upheld in these excursions by the\\r\\ncertainty that no language could outdo the splendor of her fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmemory, and although her efforts did not notably further the end of his\\r\\nbiography, she was under the impression of living more in his shade at\\r\\nsuch times than at others. No one can escape the power of language, let\\r\\nalone those of English birth brought up from childhood, as Mrs. Hilbery\\r\\nhad been, to disport themselves now in the Saxon plainness, now in the\\r\\nLatin splendor of the tongue, and stored with memories, as she was, of\\r\\nold poets exuberating in an infinity of vocables. Even Katharine\\r\\nwas slightly affected against her better judgment by her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nenthusiasm. Not that her judgment could altogether acquiesce in the\\r\\nnecessity for a study of ShakespeareÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sonnets as a preliminary to the\\r\\nfifth chapter of her grandfatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s biography. Beginning with a perfectly\\r\\nfrivolous jest, Mrs. Hilbery had evolved a theory that Anne Hathaway had\\r\\na way, among other things, of writing ShakespeareÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sonnets; the idea,\\r\\nstruck out to enliven a party of professors, who forwarded a number of\\r\\nprivately printed manuals within the next few days for her instruction,\\r\\nhad submerged her in a flood of Elizabethan literature; she had come\\r\\nhalf to believe in her joke, which was, she said, at least as good as\\r\\nother peopleÃ¢\\x80\\x99s facts, and all her fancy for the time being centered\\r\\nupon Stratford-on-Avon. She had a plan, she told Katharine, when, rather\\r\\nlater than usual, Katharine came into the room the morning after her\\r\\nwalk by the river, for visiting ShakespeareÃ¢\\x80\\x99s tomb. Any fact about the\\r\\npoet had become, for the moment, of far greater interest to her than the\\r\\nimmediate present, and the certainty that there was existing in England\\r\\na spot of ground where Shakespeare had undoubtedly stood, where his very\\r\\nbones lay directly beneath oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s feet, was so absorbing to her on this\\r\\nparticular occasion that she greeted her daughter with the exclamation:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDÃ¢\\x80\\x99you think he ever passed this house?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question, for the moment, seemed to Katharine to have reference to\\r\\nRalph Denham.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOn his way to Blackfriars, I mean,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery continued, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor you\\r\\nknow the latest discovery is that he owned a house there.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine still looked about her in perplexity, and Mrs. Hilbery added:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich is a proof that he wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t as poor as theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve sometimes said. I\\r\\nshould like to think that he had enough, though I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t in the least\\r\\nwant him to be rich.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, perceiving her daughterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s expression of perplexity, Mrs. Hilbery\\r\\nburst out laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not talking about YOUR William, though thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s another\\r\\nreason for liking him. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m talking, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m thinking, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m dreaming of MY\\r\\nWilliam--William Shakespeare, of course. IsnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it odd,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she mused,\\r\\nstanding at the window and tapping gently upon the pane, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat for all\\r\\none can see, that dear old thing in the blue bonnet, crossing the\\r\\nroad with her basket on her arm, has never heard that there was such\\r\\na person? Yet it all goes on: lawyers hurrying to their work, cabmen\\r\\nsquabbling for their fares, little boys rolling their hoops, little\\r\\ngirls throwing bread to the gulls, as if there werenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t a Shakespeare in\\r\\nthe world. I should like to stand at that crossing all day long and say:\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x98People, read Shakespeare!Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine sat down at her table and opened a long dusty envelope. As\\r\\nShelley was mentioned in the course of the letter as if he were alive,\\r\\nit had, of course, considerable value. Her immediate task was to decide\\r\\nwhether the whole letter should be printed, or only the paragraph which\\r\\nmentioned ShelleyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s name, and she reached out for a pen and held it in\\r\\nreadiness to do justice upon the sheet. Her pen, however, remained in\\r\\nthe air. Almost surreptitiously she slipped a clean sheet in front of\\r\\nher, and her hand, descending, began drawing square boxes halved and\\r\\nquartered by straight lines, and then circles which underwent the same\\r\\nprocess of dissection.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine! IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve hit upon a brilliant idea!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto\\r\\nlay out, say, a hundred pounds or so on copies of Shakespeare, and give\\r\\nthem to working men. Some of your clever friends who get up meetings\\r\\nmight help us, Katharine. And that might lead to a playhouse, where we\\r\\ncould all take parts. YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99d be Rosalind--but youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve a dash of the old\\r\\nnurse in you. Your fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Hamlet, come to years of discretion; and\\r\\nIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m--well, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m a bit of them all; IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m quite a large bit of the fool,\\r\\nbut the fools in Shakespeare say all the clever things. Now who shall\\r\\nWilliam be? A hero? Hotspur? Henry the Fifth? No, WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s got a touch\\r\\nof Hamlet in him, too. I can fancy that William talks to himself when\\r\\nheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s alone. Ah, Katharine, you must say very beautiful things when\\r\\nyouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re together!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added wistfully, with a glance at her daughter,\\r\\nwho had told her nothing about the dinner the night before.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, we talk a lot of nonsense,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, hiding her slip of\\r\\npaper as her mother stood by her, and spreading the old letter about\\r\\nShelley in front of her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t seem to you nonsense in ten yearsÃ¢\\x80\\x99 time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Hilbery.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBelieve me, Katharine, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll look back on these days afterwards;\\r\\nyouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll remember all the silly things youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve said; and youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll find that\\r\\nyour life has been built on them. The best of life is built on what we\\r\\nsay when weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re in love. It isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t nonsense, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she urged, Ã¢\\x80\\x9citÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nthe truth, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the only truth.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine was on the point of interrupting her mother, and then she was\\r\\non the point of confiding in her. They came strangely close together\\r\\nsometimes. But, while she hesitated and sought for words not too direct,\\r\\nher mother had recourse to Shakespeare, and turned page after page,\\r\\nset upon finding some quotation which said all this about love far, far\\r\\nbetter than she could. Accordingly, Katharine did nothing but scrub one\\r\\nof her circles an intense black with her pencil, in the midst of which\\r\\nprocess the telephone-bell rang, and she left the room to answer it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she returned, Mrs. Hilbery had found not the passage she wanted,\\r\\nbut another of exquisite beauty as she justly observed, looking up for a\\r\\nsecond to ask Katharine who that was?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMary Datchet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied briefly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh--I half wish IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d called you Mary, but it wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have gone with\\r\\nHilbery, and it wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have gone with Rodney. Now this isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t the\\r\\npassage I wanted. (I never can find what I want.) But itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s spring; itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nthe daffodils; itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the green fields; itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the birds.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was cut short in her quotation by another imperative telephone-bell.\\r\\nOnce more Katharine left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear child, how odious the triumphs of science are!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery\\r\\nexclaimed on her return. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be linking us with the moon next--but\\r\\nwho was that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWilliam,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied yet more briefly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll forgive William anything, for IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m certain that there arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t any\\r\\nWilliams in the moon. I hope heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s coming to luncheon?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s coming to tea.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s better than nothing, and I promise to leave you alone.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no need for you to do that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe swept her hand over the faded sheet, and drew herself up squarely\\r\\nto the table as if she refused to waste time any longer. The gesture was\\r\\nnot lost upon her mother. It hinted at the existence of something stern\\r\\nand unapproachable in her daughterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s character, which struck chill upon\\r\\nher, as the sight of poverty, or drunkenness, or the logic with which\\r\\nMr. Hilbery sometimes thought good to demolish her certainty of an\\r\\napproaching millennium struck chill upon her. She went back to her own\\r\\ntable, and putting on her spectacles with a curious expression of quiet\\r\\nhumility, addressed herself for the first time that morning to the task\\r\\nbefore her. The shock with an unsympathetic world had a sobering effect\\r\\non her. For once, her industry surpassed her daughterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s. Katharine could\\r\\nnot reduce the world to that particular perspective in which Harriet\\r\\nMartineau, for instance, was a figure of solid importance, and possessed\\r\\nof a genuine relationship to this figure or to that date. Singularly\\r\\nenough, the sharp call of the telephone-bell still echoed in her ear,\\r\\nand her body and mind were in a state of tension, as if, at any moment,\\r\\nshe might hear another summons of greater interest to her than the whole\\r\\nof the nineteenth century. She did not clearly realize what this call\\r\\nwas to be; but when the ears have got into the habit of listening, they\\r\\ngo on listening involuntarily, and thus Katharine spent the greater part\\r\\nof the morning in listening to a variety of sounds in the back streets\\r\\nof Chelsea. For the first time in her life, probably, she wished that\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery would not keep so closely to her work. A quotation from\\r\\nShakespeare would not have come amiss. Now and again she heard a sigh\\r\\nfrom her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s table, but that was the only proof she gave of her\\r\\nexistence, and Katharine did not think of connecting it with the square\\r\\naspect of her own position at the table, or, perhaps, she would have\\r\\nthrown her pen down and told her mother the reason of her restlessness.\\r\\nThe only writing she managed to accomplish in the course of the morning\\r\\nwas one letter, addressed to her cousin, Cassandra Otway--a rambling\\r\\nletter, long, affectionate, playful and commanding all at once. She bade\\r\\nCassandra put her creatures in the charge of a groom, and come to\\r\\nthem for a week or so. They would go and hear some music together.\\r\\nCassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s dislike of rational society, she said, was an affectation\\r\\nfast hardening into a prejudice, which would, in the long run, isolate\\r\\nher from all interesting people and pursuits. She was finishing the\\r\\nsheet when the sound she was anticipating all the time actually struck\\r\\nupon her ears. She jumped up hastily, and slammed the door with a\\r\\nsharpness which made Mrs. Hilbery start. Where was Katharine off to? In\\r\\nher preoccupied state she had not heard the bell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe alcove on the stairs, in which the telephone was placed, was\\r\\nscreened for privacy by a curtain of purple velvet. It was a pocket for\\r\\nsuperfluous possessions, such as exist in most houses which harbor the\\r\\nwreckage of three generations. Prints of great-uncles, famed for their\\r\\nprowess in the East, hung above Chinese teapots, whose sides were\\r\\nriveted by little gold stitches, and the precious teapots, again, stood\\r\\nupon bookcases containing the complete works of William Cowper and\\r\\nSir Walter Scott. The thread of sound, issuing from the telephone, was\\r\\nalways colored by the surroundings which received it, so it seemed to\\r\\nKatharine. Whose voice was now going to combine with them, or to strike\\r\\na discord?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhose voice?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked herself, hearing a man inquire, with great\\r\\ndetermination, for her number. The unfamiliar voice now asked for Miss\\r\\nHilbery. Out of all the welter of voices which crowd round the far end\\r\\nof the telephone, out of the enormous range of possibilities, whose\\r\\nvoice, what possibility, was this? A pause gave her time to ask herself\\r\\nthis question. It was solved next moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve looked out the train.... Early on Saturday afternoon would suit me\\r\\nbest.... IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m Ralph Denham.... But IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll write it down....Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith more than the usual sense of being impinged upon the point of a\\r\\nbayonet, Katharine replied:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think I could come. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll look at my engagements.... Hold on.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe dropped the machine, and looked fixedly at the print of the\\r\\ngreat-uncle who had not ceased to gaze, with an air of amiable\\r\\nauthority, into a world which, as yet, beheld no symptoms of the Indian\\r\\nMutiny. And yet, gently swinging against the wall, within the black\\r\\ntube, was a voice which recked nothing of Uncle James, of China teapots,\\r\\nor of red velvet curtains. She watched the oscillation of the tube, and\\r\\nat the same moment became conscious of the individuality of the house in\\r\\nwhich she stood; she heard the soft domestic sounds of regular existence\\r\\nupon staircases and floors above her head, and movements through the\\r\\nwall in the house next door. She had no very clear vision of Denham\\r\\nhimself, when she lifted the telephone to her lips and replied that\\r\\nshe thought Saturday would suit her. She hoped that he would not say\\r\\ngood-bye at once, although she felt no particular anxiety to attend to\\r\\nwhat he was saying, and began, even while he spoke, to think of her own\\r\\nupper room, with its books, its papers pressed between the leaves of\\r\\ndictionaries, and the table that could be cleared for work. She replaced\\r\\nthe instrument, thoughtfully; her restlessness was assuaged; she\\r\\nfinished her letter to Cassandra without difficulty, addressed the\\r\\nenvelope, and fixed the stamp with her usual quick decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bunch of anemones caught Mrs. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eye when they had finished\\r\\nluncheon. The blue and purple and white of the bowl, standing in a pool\\r\\nof variegated light on a polished Chippendale table in the drawing-room\\r\\nwindow, made her stop dead with an exclamation of pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWho is lying ill in bed, Katharine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she demanded. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhich of our\\r\\nfriends wants cheering up? Who feels that theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been forgotten and\\r\\npassed over, and that nobody wants them? Whose water rates are overdue,\\r\\nand the cook leaving in a temper without waiting for her wages? There\\r\\nwas somebody I know--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she concluded, but for the moment the name of\\r\\nthis desirable acquaintance escaped her. The best representative of the\\r\\nforlorn company whose day would be brightened by a bunch of anemones\\r\\nwas, in KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s opinion, the widow of a general living in the\\r\\nCromwell Road. In default of the actually destitute and starving, whom\\r\\nshe would much have preferred, Mrs. Hilbery was forced to acknowledge\\r\\nher claims, for though in comfortable circumstances, she was extremely\\r\\ndull, unattractive, connected in some oblique fashion with literature,\\r\\nand had been touched to the verge of tears, on one occasion, by an\\r\\nafternoon call.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that Mrs. Hilbery had an engagement elsewhere, so that the\\r\\ntask of taking the flowers to the Cromwell Road fell upon Katharine. She\\r\\ntook her letter to Cassandra with her, meaning to post it in the first\\r\\npillar-box she came to. When, however, she was fairly out of doors, and\\r\\nconstantly invited by pillar-boxes and post-offices to slip her envelope\\r\\ndown their scarlet throats, she forbore. She made absurd excuses, as\\r\\nthat she did not wish to cross the road, or that she was certain to pass\\r\\nanother post-office in a more central position a little farther on. The\\r\\nlonger she held the letter in her hand, however, the more persistently\\r\\ncertain questions pressed upon her, as if from a collection of voices\\r\\nin the air. These invisible people wished to be informed whether she\\r\\nwas engaged to William Rodney, or was the engagement broken off? Was\\r\\nit right, they asked, to invite Cassandra for a visit, and was William\\r\\nRodney in love with her, or likely to fall in love? Then the questioners\\r\\npaused for a moment, and resumed as if another side of the problem had\\r\\njust come to their notice. What did Ralph Denham mean by what he said to\\r\\nyou last night? Do you consider that he is in love with you? Is it right\\r\\nto consent to a solitary walk with him, and what advice are you going\\r\\nto give him about his future? Has William Rodney cause to be jealous of\\r\\nyour conduct, and what do you propose to do about Mary Datchet? What are\\r\\nyou going to do? What does honor require you to do? they repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood Heavens!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine exclaimed, after listening to all these\\r\\nremarks, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose I ought to make up my mind.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the debate was a formal skirmishing, a pastime to gain\\r\\nbreathing-space. Like all people brought up in a tradition, Katharine\\r\\nwas able, within ten minutes or so, to reduce any moral difficulty to\\r\\nits traditional shape and solve it by the traditional answers. The book\\r\\nof wisdom lay open, if not upon her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s knee, upon the knees of\\r\\nmany uncles and aunts. She had only to consult them, and they would at\\r\\nonce turn to the right page and read out an answer exactly suited to\\r\\none in her position. The rules which should govern the behavior of an\\r\\nunmarried woman are written in red ink, graved upon marble, if, by some\\r\\nfreak of nature, it should fall out that the unmarried woman has not the\\r\\nsame writing scored upon her heart. She was ready to believe that some\\r\\npeople are fortunate enough to reject, accept, resign, or lay down their\\r\\nlives at the bidding of traditional authority; she could envy them; but\\r\\nin her case the questions became phantoms directly she tried seriously\\r\\nto find an answer, which proved that the traditional answer would be\\r\\nof no use to her individually. Yet it had served so many people, she\\r\\nthought, glancing at the rows of houses on either side of her, where\\r\\nfamilies, whose incomes must be between a thousand and fifteen-hundred a\\r\\nyear lived, and kept, perhaps, three servants, and draped their windows\\r\\nwith curtains which were always thick and generally dirty, and must,\\r\\nshe thought, since you could only see a looking-glass gleaming above a\\r\\nsideboard on which a dish of apples was set, keep the room inside very\\r\\ndark. But she turned her head away, observing that this was not a method\\r\\nof thinking the matter out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only truth which she could discover was the truth of what she\\r\\nherself felt--a frail beam when compared with the broad illumination\\r\\nshed by the eyes of all the people who are in agreement to see together;\\r\\nbut having rejected the visionary voices, she had no choice but to make\\r\\nthis her guide through the dark masses which confronted her. She tried\\r\\nto follow her beam, with an expression upon her face which would have\\r\\nmade any passer-by think her reprehensibly and almost ridiculously\\r\\ndetached from the surrounding scene. One would have felt alarmed lest\\r\\nthis young and striking woman were about to do something eccentric. But\\r\\nher beauty saved her from the worst fate that can befall a pedestrian;\\r\\npeople looked at her, but they did not laugh. To seek a true feeling\\r\\namong the chaos of the unfeelings or half-feelings of life, to recognize\\r\\nit when found, and to accept the consequences of the discovery, draws\\r\\nlines upon the smoothest brow, while it quickens the light of the\\r\\neyes; it is a pursuit which is alternately bewildering, debasing, and\\r\\nexalting, and, as Katharine speedily found, her discoveries gave her\\r\\nequal cause for surprise, shame, and intense anxiety. Much depended,\\r\\nas usual, upon the interpretation of the word love; which word came up\\r\\nagain and again, whether she considered Rodney, Denham, Mary Datchet,\\r\\nor herself; and in each case it seemed to stand for something different,\\r\\nand yet for something unmistakable and something not to be passed by.\\r\\nFor the more she looked into the confusion of lives which, instead\\r\\nof running parallel, had suddenly intersected each other, the more\\r\\ndistinctly she seemed to convince herself that there was no other light\\r\\non them than was shed by this strange illumination, and no other path\\r\\nsave the one upon which it threw its beams. Her blindness in the case\\r\\nof Rodney, her attempt to match his true feeling with her false feeling,\\r\\nwas a failure never to be sufficiently condemned; indeed, she could only\\r\\npay it the tribute of leaving it a black and naked landmark unburied by\\r\\nattempt at oblivion or excuse.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this to humiliate there was much to exalt. She thought of three\\r\\ndifferent scenes; she thought of Mary sitting upright and saying,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m in love--IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m in loveÃ¢\\x80\\x9d; she thought of Rodney losing his\\r\\nself-consciousness among the dead leaves, and speaking with the\\r\\nabandonment of a child; she thought of Denham leaning upon the stone\\r\\nparapet and talking to the distant sky, so that she thought him mad. Her\\r\\nmind, passing from Mary to Denham, from William to Cassandra, and from\\r\\nDenham to herself--if, as she rather doubted, DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s state of mind\\r\\nwas connected with herself--seemed to be tracing out the lines of some\\r\\nsymmetrical pattern, some arrangement of life, which invested, if not\\r\\nherself, at least the others, not only with interest, but with a kind\\r\\nof tragic beauty. She had a fantastic picture of them upholding splendid\\r\\npalaces upon their bent backs. They were the lantern-bearers, whose\\r\\nlights, scattered among the crowd, wove a pattern, dissolving, joining,\\r\\nmeeting again in combination. Half forming such conceptions as these\\r\\nin her rapid walk along the dreary streets of South Kensington, she\\r\\ndetermined that, whatever else might be obscure, she must further\\r\\nthe objects of Mary, Denham, William, and Cassandra. The way was not\\r\\napparent. No course of action seemed to her indubitably right. All she\\r\\nachieved by her thinking was the conviction that, in such a cause, no\\r\\nrisk was too great; and that, far from making any rules for herself or\\r\\nothers, she would let difficulties accumulate unsolved, situations widen\\r\\ntheir jaws unsatiated, while she maintained a position of absolute and\\r\\nfearless independence. So she could best serve the people who loved.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead in the light of this exaltation, there was a new meaning in the\\r\\nwords which her mother had penciled upon the card attached to the bunch\\r\\nof anemones. The door of the house in the Cromwell Road opened; gloomy\\r\\nvistas of passage and staircase were revealed; such light as there was\\r\\nseemed to be concentrated upon a silver salver of visiting-cards, whose\\r\\nblack borders suggested that the widowÃ¢\\x80\\x99s friends had all suffered the\\r\\nsame bereavement. The parlor-maid could hardly be expected to fathom the\\r\\nmeaning of the grave tone in which the young lady proffered the flowers,\\r\\nwith Mrs. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s love; and the door shut upon the offering.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sight of a face, the slam of a door, are both rather destructive\\r\\nof exaltation in the abstract; and, as she walked back to Chelsea,\\r\\nKatharine had her doubts whether anything would come of her resolves.\\r\\nIf you cannot make sure of people, however, you can hold fairly fast to\\r\\nfigures, and in some way or other her thought about such problems as she\\r\\nwas wont to consider worked in happily with her mood as to her friendsÃ¢\\x80\\x99\\r\\nlives. She reached home rather late for tea.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the ancient Dutch chest in the hall she perceived one or two hats,\\r\\ncoats, and walking-sticks, and the sound of voices reached her as she\\r\\nstood outside the drawing-room door. Her mother gave a little cry as she\\r\\ncame in; a cry which conveyed to Katharine the fact that she was late,\\r\\nthat the teacups and milk-jugs were in a conspiracy of disobedience, and\\r\\nthat she must immediately take her place at the head of the table and\\r\\npour out tea for the guests. Augustus Pelham, the diarist, liked a calm\\r\\natmosphere in which to tell his stories; he liked attention; he liked to\\r\\nelicit little facts, little stories, about the past and the great dead,\\r\\nfrom such distinguished characters as Mrs. Hilbery for the nourishment\\r\\nof his diary, for whose sake he frequented tea-tables and ate yearly an\\r\\nenormous quantity of buttered toast. He, therefore, welcomed Katharine\\r\\nwith relief, and she had merely to shake hands with Rodney and to greet\\r\\nthe American lady who had come to be shown the relics, before the talk\\r\\nstarted again on the broad lines of reminiscence and discussion which\\r\\nwere familiar to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, even with this thick veil between them, she could not help looking\\r\\nat Rodney, as if she could detect what had happened to him since they\\r\\nmet. It was in vain. His clothes, even the white slip, the pearl in his\\r\\ntie, seemed to intercept her quick glance, and to proclaim the futility\\r\\nof such inquiries of a discreet, urbane gentleman, who balanced his cup\\r\\nof tea and poised a slice of bread and butter on the edge of the saucer.\\r\\nHe would not meet her eye, but that could be accounted for by his\\r\\nactivity in serving and helping, and the polite alacrity with which he\\r\\nwas answering the questions of the American visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was certainly a sight to daunt any one coming in with a head full\\r\\nof theories about love. The voices of the invisible questioners were\\r\\nreinforced by the scene round the table, and sounded with a tremendous\\r\\nself-confidence, as if they had behind them the common sense of twenty\\r\\ngenerations, together with the immediate approval of Mr. Augustus\\r\\nPelham, Mrs. Vermont Bankes, William Rodney, and, possibly, Mrs. Hilbery\\r\\nherself. Katharine set her teeth, not entirely in the metaphorical\\r\\nsense, for her hand, obeying the impulse towards definite action, laid\\r\\nfirmly upon the table beside her an envelope which she had been grasping\\r\\nall this time in complete forgetfulness. The address was uppermost, and\\r\\na moment later she saw WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eye rest upon it as he rose to fulfil\\r\\nsome duty with a plate. His expression instantly changed. He did what\\r\\nhe was on the point of doing, and then looked at Katharine with a look\\r\\nwhich revealed enough of his confusion to show her that he was not\\r\\nentirely represented by his appearance. In a minute or two he proved\\r\\nhimself at a loss with Mrs. Vermont Bankes, and Mrs. Hilbery, aware of\\r\\nthe silence with her usual quickness, suggested that, perhaps, it was\\r\\nnow time that Mrs. Bankes should be shown Ã¢\\x80\\x9cour things.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine accordingly rose, and led the way to the little inner room\\r\\nwith the pictures and the books. Mrs. Bankes and Rodney followed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned on the lights, and began directly in her low, pleasant voice:\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis table is my grandfatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s writing-table. Most of the later poems\\r\\nwere written at it. And this is his pen--the last pen he ever used.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She\\r\\ntook it in her hand and paused for the right number of seconds. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHere,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she continued, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis the original manuscript of the Ã¢\\x80\\x98Ode to Winter.Ã¢\\x80\\x99 The\\r\\nearly manuscripts are far less corrected than the later ones, as you\\r\\nwill see directly.... Oh, do take it yourself,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, as Mrs.\\r\\nBankes asked, in an awestruck tone of voice, for that privilege, and\\r\\nbegan a preliminary unbuttoning of her white kid gloves.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are wonderfully like your grandfather, Miss Hilbery,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the American\\r\\nlady observed, gazing from Katharine to the portrait, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cespecially about\\r\\nthe eyes. Come, now, I expect she writes poetry herself, doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t she?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she asked in a jocular tone, turning to William. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cQuite oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s ideal of\\r\\na poet, is it not, Mr. Rodney? I cannot tell you what a privilege I feel\\r\\nit to be standing just here with the poetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s granddaughter. You must know\\r\\nwe think a great deal of your grandfather in America, Miss Hilbery.\\r\\nWe have societies for reading him aloud. What! His very own slippers!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Laying aside the manuscript, she hastily grasped the old shoes, and\\r\\nremained for a moment dumb in contemplation of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Katharine went on steadily with her duties as show-woman, Rodney\\r\\nexamined intently a row of little drawings which he knew by heart\\r\\nalready. His disordered state of mind made it necessary for him to take\\r\\nadvantage of these little respites, as if he had been out in a high wind\\r\\nand must straighten his dress in the first shelter he reached. His calm\\r\\nwas only superficial, as he knew too well; it did not exist much below\\r\\nthe surface of tie, waistcoat, and white slip.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn getting out of bed that morning he had fully made up his mind to\\r\\nignore what had been said the night before; he had been convinced, by\\r\\nthe sight of Denham, that his love for Katharine was passionate, and\\r\\nwhen he addressed her early that morning on the telephone, he had meant\\r\\nhis cheerful but authoritative tones to convey to her the fact that,\\r\\nafter a night of madness, they were as indissolubly engaged as ever. But\\r\\nwhen he reached his office his torments began. He found a letter from\\r\\nCassandra waiting for him. She had read his play, and had taken the\\r\\nvery first opportunity to write and tell him what she thought of it. She\\r\\nknew, she wrote, that her praise meant absolutely nothing; but still,\\r\\nshe had sat up all night; she thought this, that, and the other; she was\\r\\nfull of enthusiasm most elaborately scratched out in places, but enough\\r\\nwas written plain to gratify WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s vanity exceedingly. She was quite\\r\\nintelligent enough to say the right things, or, even more charmingly,\\r\\nto hint at them. In other ways, too, it was a very charming letter. She\\r\\ntold him about her music, and about a Suffrage meeting to which Henry\\r\\nhad taken her, and she asserted, half seriously, that she had learnt the\\r\\nGreek alphabet, and found it Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfascinating.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The word was underlined. Had\\r\\nshe laughed when she drew that line? Was she ever serious? DidnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t the\\r\\nletter show the most engaging compound of enthusiasm and spirit and\\r\\nwhimsicality, all tapering into a flame of girlish freakishness, which\\r\\nflitted, for the rest of the morning, as a will-oÃ¢\\x80\\x99-the-wisp, across\\r\\nRodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s landscape. He could not resist beginning an answer to her there\\r\\nand then. He found it particularly delightful to shape a style which\\r\\nshould express the bowing and curtsying, advancing and retreating, which\\r\\nare characteristic of one of the many million partnerships of men and\\r\\nwomen. Katharine never trod that particular measure, he could not help\\r\\nreflecting; Katharine--Cassandra; Cassandra--Katharine--they alternated\\r\\nin his consciousness all day long. It was all very well to dress oneself\\r\\ncarefully, compose oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s face, and start off punctually at half-past\\r\\nfour to a tea-party in Cheyne Walk, but Heaven only knew what would\\r\\ncome of it all, and when Katharine, after sitting silent with her usual\\r\\nimmobility, wantonly drew from her pocket and slapped down on the table\\r\\nbeneath his eyes a letter addressed to Cassandra herself, his composure\\r\\ndeserted him. What did she mean by her behavior?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked up sharply from his row of little pictures. Katharine was\\r\\ndisposing of the American lady in far too arbitrary a fashion. Surely\\r\\nthe victim herself must see how foolish her enthusiasms appeared in the\\r\\neyes of the poetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s granddaughter. Katharine never made any attempt to\\r\\nspare peopleÃ¢\\x80\\x99s feelings, he reflected; and, being himself very sensitive\\r\\nto all shades of comfort and discomfort, he cut short the auctioneerÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncatalog, which Katharine was reeling off more and more absent-mindedly,\\r\\nand took Mrs. Vermont Bankes, with a queer sense of fellowship in\\r\\nsuffering, under his own protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut within a few minutes the American lady had completed her inspection,\\r\\nand inclining her head in a little nod of reverential farewell to the\\r\\npoet and his shoes, she was escorted downstairs by Rodney. Katharine\\r\\nstayed by herself in the little room. The ceremony of ancestor-worship\\r\\nhad been more than usually oppressive to her. Moreover, the room was\\r\\nbecoming crowded beyond the bounds of order. Only that morning a heavily\\r\\ninsured proof-sheet had reached them from a collector in Australia,\\r\\nwhich recorded a change of the poetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mind about a very famous phrase,\\r\\nand, therefore, had claims to the honor of glazing and framing. But\\r\\nwas there room for it? Must it be hung on the staircase, or should some\\r\\nother relic give place to do it honor? Feeling unable to decide the\\r\\nquestion, Katharine glanced at the portrait of her grandfather, as if to\\r\\nask his opinion. The artist who had painted it was now out of fashion,\\r\\nand by dint of showing it to visitors, Katharine had almost ceased\\r\\nto see anything but a glow of faintly pleasing pink and brown tints,\\r\\nenclosed within a circular scroll of gilt laurel-leaves. The young man\\r\\nwho was her grandfather looked vaguely over her head. The sensual lips\\r\\nwere slightly parted, and gave the face an expression of beholding\\r\\nsomething lovely or miraculous vanishing or just rising upon the rim of\\r\\nthe distance. The expression repeated itself curiously upon KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nface as she gazed up into his. They were the same age, or very nearly\\r\\nso. She wondered what he was looking for; were there waves beating\\r\\nupon a shore for him, too, she wondered, and heroes riding through the\\r\\nleaf-hung forests? For perhaps the first time in her life she thought of\\r\\nhim as a man, young, unhappy, tempestuous, full of desires and faults;\\r\\nfor the first time she realized him for herself, and not from her\\r\\nmotherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s memory. He might have been her brother, she thought. It seemed\\r\\nto her that they were akin, with the mysterious kinship of blood which\\r\\nmakes it seem possible to interpret the sights which the eyes of the\\r\\ndead behold so intently, or even to believe that they look with us upon\\r\\nour present joys and sorrows. He would have understood, she thought,\\r\\nsuddenly; and instead of laying her withered flowers upon his shrine,\\r\\nshe brought him her own perplexities--perhaps a gift of greater value,\\r\\nshould the dead be conscious of gifts, than flowers and incense and\\r\\nadoration. Doubts, questionings, and despondencies she felt, as she\\r\\nlooked up, would be more welcome to him than homage, and he would hold\\r\\nthem but a very small burden if she gave him, also, some share in what\\r\\nshe suffered and achieved. The depth of her own pride and love were not\\r\\nmore apparent to her than the sense that the dead asked neither flowers\\r\\nnor regrets, but a share in the life which they had given her, the life\\r\\nwhich they had lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nRodney found her a moment later sitting beneath her grandfatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nportrait. She laid her hand on the seat next her in a friendly way, and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCome and sit down, William. How glad I was you were here! I felt myself\\r\\ngetting ruder and ruder.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are not good at hiding your feelings,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned dryly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t scold me--IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve had a horrid afternoon.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She told him how\\r\\nshe had taken the flowers to Mrs. McCormick, and how South Kensington\\r\\nimpressed her as the preserve of officersÃ¢\\x80\\x99 widows. She described how\\r\\nthe door had opened, and what gloomy avenues of busts and palm-trees and\\r\\numbrellas had been revealed to her. She spoke lightly, and succeeded in\\r\\nputting him at his ease. Indeed, he rapidly became too much at his ease\\r\\nto persist in a condition of cheerful neutrality. He felt his composure\\r\\nslipping from him. Katharine made it seem so natural to ask her to help\\r\\nhim, or advise him, to say straight out what he had in his mind. The\\r\\nletter from Cassandra was heavy in his pocket. There was also the letter\\r\\nto Cassandra lying on the table in the next room. The atmosphere seemed\\r\\ncharged with Cassandra. But, unless Katharine began the subject of her\\r\\nown accord, he could not even hint--he must ignore the whole affair; it\\r\\nwas the part of a gentleman to preserve a bearing that was, as far as\\r\\nhe could make it, the bearing of an undoubting lover. At intervals\\r\\nhe sighed deeply. He talked rather more quickly than usual about the\\r\\npossibility that some of the operas of Mozart would be played in the\\r\\nsummer. He had received a notice, he said, and at once produced a\\r\\npocket-book stuffed with papers, and began shuffling them in search.\\r\\nHe held a thick envelope between his finger and thumb, as if the notice\\r\\nfrom the opera company had become in some way inseparably attached to\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA letter from Cassandra?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, in the easiest voice in the\\r\\nworld, looking over his shoulder. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve just written to ask her to come\\r\\nhere, only I forgot to post it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe handed her the envelope in silence. She took it, extracted the\\r\\nsheets, and read the letter through.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reading seemed to Rodney to take an intolerably long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she observed at length, Ã¢\\x80\\x9ca very charming letter.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s face was half turned away, as if in bashfulness. Her view of\\r\\nhis profile almost moved her to laughter. She glanced through the pages\\r\\nonce more.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI see no harm,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William blurted out, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cin helping her--with Greek, for\\r\\nexample--if she really cares for that sort of thing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no reason why she shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t care,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, consulting\\r\\nthe pages once more. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIn fact--ah, here it is--Ã¢\\x80\\x98The Greek alphabet is\\r\\nabsolutely FASCINATING.Ã¢\\x80\\x99 Obviously she does care.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, Greek may be rather a large order. I was thinking chiefly\\r\\nof English. Her criticisms of my play, though theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re too generous,\\r\\nevidently immature--she canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be more than twenty-two, I suppose?--they\\r\\ncertainly show the sort of thing one wants: real feeling for poetry,\\r\\nunderstanding, not formed, of course, but itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s at the root of everything\\r\\nafter all. ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99d be no harm in lending her books?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. Certainly not.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut if it--hum--led to a correspondence? I mean, Katharine, I take it,\\r\\nwithout going into matters which seem to me a little morbid, I mean,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n he floundered, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou, from your point of view, feel that thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s nothing\\r\\ndisagreeable to you in the notion? If so, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve only to speak, and I\\r\\nnever think of it again.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was surprised by the violence of her desire that he never should\\r\\nthink of it again. For an instant it seemed to her impossible to\\r\\nsurrender an intimacy, which might not be the intimacy of love, but was\\r\\ncertainly the intimacy of true friendship, to any woman in the world.\\r\\nCassandra would never understand him--she was not good enough for him.\\r\\nThe letter seemed to her a letter of flattery--a letter addressed to his\\r\\nweakness, which it made her angry to think was known to another. For he\\r\\nwas not weak; he had the rare strength of doing what he promised--she\\r\\nhad only to speak, and he would never think of Cassandra again.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused. Rodney guessed the reason. He was amazed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe loves me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he thought. The woman he admired more than any one in\\r\\nthe world, loved him, as he had given up hope that she would ever\\r\\nlove him. And now that for the first time he was sure of her love, he\\r\\nresented it. He felt it as a fetter, an encumbrance, something which\\r\\nmade them both, but him in particular, ridiculous. He was in her power\\r\\ncompletely, but his eyes were open and he was no longer her slave or her\\r\\ndupe. He would be her master in future. The instant prolonged itself as\\r\\nKatharine realized the strength of her desire to speak the words that\\r\\nshould keep William for ever, and the baseness of the temptation which\\r\\nassailed her to make the movement, or speak the word, which he had often\\r\\nbegged her for, which she was now near enough to feeling. She held the\\r\\nletter in her hand. She sat silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment there was a stir in the other room; the voice of\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery was heard talking of proof-sheets rescued by miraculous\\r\\nprovidence from butcherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s ledgers in Australia; the curtain separating\\r\\none room from the other was drawn apart, and Mrs. Hilbery and Augustus\\r\\nPelham stood in the doorway. Mrs. Hilbery stopped short. She looked\\r\\nat her daughter, and at the man her daughter was to marry, with her\\r\\npeculiar smile that always seemed to tremble on the brink of satire.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe best of all my treasures, Mr. Pelham!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t move,\\r\\nKatharine. Sit still, William. Mr. Pelham will come another day.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pelham looked, smiled, bowed, and, as his hostess had moved on,\\r\\nfollowed her without a word. The curtain was drawn again either by him\\r\\nor by Mrs. Hilbery.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut her mother had settled the question somehow. Katharine doubted no\\r\\nlonger.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs I told you last night,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s your duty, if\\r\\nthereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a chance that you care for Cassandra, to discover what your\\r\\nfeeling is for her now. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s your duty to her, as well as to me. But we\\r\\nmust tell my mother. We canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t go on pretending.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat is entirely in your hands, of course,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Rodney, with an\\r\\nimmediate return to the manner of a formal man of honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery well,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirectly he left her she would go to her mother, and explain that the\\r\\nengagement was at an end--or it might be better that they should go\\r\\ntogether?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney began, nervously attempting to stuff\\r\\nCassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sheets back into their envelope; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif Cassandra--should\\r\\nCassandra--youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve asked Cassandra to stay with you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes; but IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve not posted the letter.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe crossed his knees in a discomfited silence. By all his codes it\\r\\nwas impossible to ask a woman with whom he had just broken off his\\r\\nengagement to help him to become acquainted with another woman with a\\r\\nview to his falling in love with her. If it was announced that their\\r\\nengagement was over, a long and complete separation would inevitably\\r\\nfollow; in those circumstances, letters and gifts were returned; after\\r\\nyears of distance the severed couple met, perhaps at an evening party,\\r\\nand touched hands uncomfortably with an indifferent word or two.\\r\\nHe would be cast off completely; he would have to trust to his own\\r\\nresources. He could never mention Cassandra to Katharine again; for\\r\\nmonths, and doubtless years, he would never see Katharine again;\\r\\nanything might happen to her in his absence.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine was almost as well aware of his perplexities as he was.\\r\\nShe knew in what direction complete generosity pointed the way; but\\r\\npride--for to remain engaged to Rodney and to cover his experiments hurt\\r\\nwhat was nobler in her than mere vanity--fought for its life.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m to give up my freedom for an indefinite time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cin\\r\\norder that William may see Cassandra here at his ease. HeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not the\\r\\ncourage to manage it without my help--heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s too much of a coward to tell\\r\\nme openly what he wants. He hates the notion of a public breach. He\\r\\nwants to keep us both.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she reached this point, Rodney pocketed the letter and elaborately\\r\\nlooked at his watch. Although the action meant that he resigned\\r\\nCassandra, for he knew his own incompetence and distrusted himself\\r\\nentirely, and lost Katharine, for whom his feeling was profound though\\r\\nunsatisfactory, still it appeared to him that there was nothing else\\r\\nleft for him to do. He was forced to go, leaving Katharine free, as he\\r\\nhad said, to tell her mother that the engagement was at an end. But to\\r\\ndo what plain duty required of an honorable man, cost an effort which\\r\\nonly a day or two ago would have been inconceivable to him. That a\\r\\nrelationship such as he had glanced at with desire could be possible\\r\\nbetween him and Katharine, he would have been the first, two days ago,\\r\\nto deny with indignation. But now his life had changed; his attitude\\r\\nhad changed; his feelings were different; new aims and possibilities\\r\\nhad been shown him, and they had an almost irresistible fascination\\r\\nand force. The training of a life of thirty-five years had not left him\\r\\ndefenceless; he was still master of his dignity; he rose, with a mind\\r\\nmade up to an irrevocable farewell.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI leave you, then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, standing up and holding out his hand with\\r\\nan effort that left him pale, but lent him dignity, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto tell your mother\\r\\nthat our engagement is ended by your desire.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took his hand and held it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t trust me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI do, absolutely,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. You donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t trust me to help you.... I could help you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m hopeless without your help!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed passionately, but\\r\\nwithdrew his hand and turned his back. When he faced her, she thought\\r\\nthat she saw him for the first time without disguise.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s useless to pretend that I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand what youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re offering,\\r\\nKatharine. I admit what you say. Speaking to you perfectly frankly, I\\r\\nbelieve at this moment that I do love your cousin; there is a chance\\r\\nthat, with your help, I might--but no,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he broke off, Ã¢\\x80\\x9citÃ¢\\x80\\x99s impossible,\\r\\nitÃ¢\\x80\\x99s wrong--IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m infinitely to blame for having allowed this situation to\\r\\narise.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSit beside me. LetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s consider sensibly--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYour sense has been our undoing--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he groaned.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI accept the responsibility.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, but can I allow that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt would mean--for we must\\r\\nface it, Katharine--that we let our engagement stand for the time\\r\\nnominally; in fact, of course, your freedom would be absolute.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd yours too.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, we should both be free. Let us say that I saw Cassandra once,\\r\\ntwice, perhaps, under these conditions; and then if, as I think certain,\\r\\nthe whole thing proves a dream, we tell your mother instantly. Why not\\r\\ntell her now, indeed, under pledge of secrecy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy not? It would be over London in ten minutes, besides, she would\\r\\nnever even remotely understand.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYour father, then? This secrecy is detestable--itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s dishonorable.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy father would understand even less than my mother.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, who could be expected to understand?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney groaned; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nfrom your point of view that we must look at it. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not only asking\\r\\ntoo much, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s putting you into a position--a position in which I could\\r\\nnot endure to see my own sister.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWeÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not brothers and sisters,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said impatiently, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand if we canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ndecide, who can? IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not talking nonsense,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she proceeded. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve done\\r\\nmy best to think this out from every point of view, and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve come to the\\r\\nconclusion that there are risks which have to be taken,--though I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ndeny that they hurt horribly.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine, you mind? YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll mind too much.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo I shanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said stoutly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI shall mind a good deal, but IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nprepared for that; I shall get through it, because you will help me.\\r\\nYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll both help me. In fact, weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll help each other. ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a Christian\\r\\ndoctrine, isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt sounds more like Paganism to me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney groaned, as he reviewed the\\r\\nsituation into which her Christian doctrine was plunging them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet he could not deny that a divine relief possessed him, and that\\r\\nthe future, instead of wearing a lead-colored mask, now blossomed with\\r\\na thousand varied gaieties and excitements. He was actually to see\\r\\nCassandra within a week or perhaps less, and he was more anxious to know\\r\\nthe date of her arrival than he could own even to himself. It seemed\\r\\nbase to be so anxious to pluck this fruit of KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s unexampled\\r\\ngenerosity and of his own contemptible baseness. And yet, though he used\\r\\nthese words automatically, they had now no meaning. He was not debased\\r\\nin his own eyes by what he had done, and as for praising Katharine,\\r\\nwere they not partners, conspirators, people bent upon the same quest\\r\\ntogether, so that to praise the pursuit of a common end as an act of\\r\\ngenerosity was meaningless. He took her hand and pressed it, not in\\r\\nthanks so much as in an ecstasy of comradeship.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe will help each other,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, repeating her words, seeking her\\r\\neyes in an enthusiasm of friendship.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eyes were grave but dark with sadness as they rested on him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nalready gone,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfar away--he thinks of me no more.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d And\\r\\nthe fancy came to her that, as they sat side by side, hand in hand, she\\r\\ncould hear the earth pouring from above to make a barrier between\\r\\nthem, so that, as they sat, they were separated second by second by\\r\\nan impenetrable wall. The process, which affected her as that of being\\r\\nsealed away and for ever from all companionship with the person she\\r\\ncared for most, came to an end at last, and by common consent they\\r\\nunclasped their fingers, Rodney touching hers with his lips, as the\\r\\ncurtain parted, and Mrs. Hilbery peered through the opening with her\\r\\nbenevolent and sarcastic expression to ask whether Katharine could\\r\\nremember was it Tuesday or Wednesday, and did she dine in Westminster?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDearest William,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, pausing, as if she could not resist the\\r\\npleasure of encroaching for a second upon this wonderful world of love\\r\\nand confidence and romance. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDearest children,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, disappearing\\r\\nwith an impulsive gesture, as if she forced herself to draw the curtain\\r\\nupon a scene which she refused all temptation to interrupt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXV\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a quarter-past three in the afternoon of the following Saturday\\r\\nRalph Denham sat on the bank of the lake in Kew Gardens, dividing the\\r\\ndial-plate of his watch into sections with his forefinger. The just and\\r\\ninexorable nature of time itself was reflected in his face. He might\\r\\nhave been composing a hymn to the unhasting and unresting march of that\\r\\ndivinity. He seemed to greet the lapse of minute after minute with stern\\r\\nacquiescence in the inevitable order. His expression was so severe, so\\r\\nserene, so immobile, that it seemed obvious that for him at least there\\r\\nwas a grandeur in the departing hour which no petty irritation on his\\r\\npart was to mar, although the wasting time wasted also high private\\r\\nhopes of his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis face was no bad index to what went on within him. He was in a\\r\\ncondition of mind rather too exalted for the trivialities of daily life.\\r\\nHe could not accept the fact that a lady was fifteen minutes late in\\r\\nkeeping her appointment without seeing in that accident the frustration\\r\\nof his entire life. Looking at his watch, he seemed to look deep into\\r\\nthe springs of human existence, and by the light of what he saw there\\r\\naltered his course towards the north and the midnight.... Yes, oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nvoyage must be made absolutely without companions through ice and black\\r\\nwater--towards what goal? Here he laid his finger upon the half-hour,\\r\\nand decided that when the minute-hand reached that point he would go, at\\r\\nthe same time answering the question put by another of the many voices\\r\\nof consciousness with the reply that there was undoubtedly a goal, but\\r\\nthat it would need the most relentless energy to keep anywhere in its\\r\\ndirection. Still, still, one goes on, the ticking seconds seemed to\\r\\nassure him, with dignity, with open eyes, with determination not to\\r\\naccept the second-rate, not to be tempted by the unworthy, not to yield,\\r\\nnot to compromise. Twenty-five minutes past three were now marked upon\\r\\nthe face of the watch. The world, he assured himself, since Katharine\\r\\nHilbery was now half an hour behind her time, offers no happiness, no\\r\\nrest from struggle, no certainty. In a scheme of things utterly bad from\\r\\nthe start the only unpardonable folly is that of hope. Raising his\\r\\neyes for a moment from the face of his watch, he rested them upon the\\r\\nopposite bank, reflectively and not without a certain wistfulness, as\\r\\nif the sternness of their gaze were still capable of mitigation. Soon a\\r\\nlook of the deepest satisfaction filled them, though, for a moment, he\\r\\ndid not move. He watched a lady who came rapidly, and yet with a trace\\r\\nof hesitation, down the broad grass-walk towards him. She did not see\\r\\nhim. Distance lent her figure an indescribable height, and romance\\r\\nseemed to surround her from the floating of a purple veil which the\\r\\nlight air filled and curved from her shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHere she comes, like a ship in full sail,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said to himself, half\\r\\nremembering some line from a play or poem where the heroine bore down\\r\\nthus with feathers flying and airs saluting her. The greenery and the\\r\\nhigh presences of the trees surrounded her as if they stood forth at her\\r\\ncoming. He rose, and she saw him; her little exclamation proved that she\\r\\nwas glad to find him, and then that she blamed herself for being late.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy did you never tell me? I didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know there was this,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she remarked,\\r\\nalluding to the lake, the broad green space, the vista of trees, with\\r\\nthe ruffled gold of the Thames in the distance and the Ducal castle\\r\\nstanding in its meadows. She paid the rigid tail of the Ducal lion the\\r\\ntribute of incredulous laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve never been to Kew?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it appeared that she had come once as a small child, when the\\r\\ngeography of the place was entirely different, and the fauna included\\r\\ncertainly flamingoes and, possibly, camels. They strolled on,\\r\\nrefashioning these legendary gardens. She was, as he felt, glad merely\\r\\nto stroll and loiter and let her fancy touch upon anything her eyes\\r\\nencountered--a bush, a park-keeper, a decorated goose--as if the\\r\\nrelaxation soothed her. The warmth of the afternoon, the first of\\r\\nspring, tempted them to sit upon a seat in a glade of beech-trees, with\\r\\nforest drives striking green paths this way and that around them. She\\r\\nsighed deeply.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s so peaceful,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, as if in explanation of her sigh. Not a\\r\\nsingle person was in sight, and the stir of the wind in the branches,\\r\\nthat sound so seldom heard by Londoners, seemed to her as if wafted from\\r\\nfathomless oceans of sweet air in the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she breathed and looked, Denham was engaged in uncovering with the\\r\\npoint of his stick a group of green spikes half smothered by the dead\\r\\nleaves. He did this with the peculiar touch of the botanist. In naming\\r\\nthe little green plant to her he used the Latin name, thus disguising\\r\\nsome flower familiar even to Chelsea, and making her exclaim, half in\\r\\namusement, at his knowledge. Her own ignorance was vast, she confessed.\\r\\nWhat did one call that tree opposite, for instance, supposing one\\r\\ncondescended to call it by its English name? Beech or elm or sycamore?\\r\\nIt chanced, by the testimony of a dead leaf, to be oak; and a little\\r\\nattention to a diagram which Denham proceeded to draw upon an envelope\\r\\nsoon put Katharine in possession of some of the fundamental distinctions\\r\\nbetween our British trees. She then asked him to inform her about\\r\\nflowers. To her they were variously shaped and colored petals, poised,\\r\\nat different seasons of the year, upon very similar green stalks; but to\\r\\nhim they were, in the first instance, bulbs or seeds, and later, living\\r\\nthings endowed with sex, and pores, and susceptibilities which adapted\\r\\nthemselves by all manner of ingenious devices to live and beget life,\\r\\nand could be fashioned squat or tapering, flame-colored or pale, pure or\\r\\nspotted, by processes which might reveal the secrets of human existence.\\r\\nDenham spoke with increasing ardor of a hobby which had long been his in\\r\\nsecret. No discourse could have worn a more welcome sound in KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nears. For weeks she had heard nothing that made such pleasant music in\\r\\nher mind. It wakened echoes in all those remote fastnesses of her being\\r\\nwhere loneliness had brooded so long undisturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wished he would go on for ever talking of plants, and showing her\\r\\nhow science felt not quite blindly for the law that ruled their endless\\r\\nvariations. A law that might be inscrutable but was certainly omnipotent\\r\\nappealed to her at the moment, because she could find nothing like it\\r\\nin possession of human lives. Circumstances had long forced her, as\\r\\nthey force most women in the flower of youth, to consider, painfully and\\r\\nminutely, all that part of life which is conspicuously without\\r\\norder; she had had to consider moods and wishes, degrees of liking or\\r\\ndisliking, and their effect upon the destiny of people dear to her; she\\r\\nhad been forced to deny herself any contemplation of that other part of\\r\\nlife where thought constructs a destiny which is independent of human\\r\\nbeings. As Denham spoke, she followed his words and considered their\\r\\nbearing with an easy vigor which spoke of a capacity long hoarded and\\r\\nunspent. The very trees and the green merging into the blue distance\\r\\nbecame symbols of the vast external world which recks so little of the\\r\\nhappiness, of the marriages or deaths of individuals. In order to give\\r\\nher examples of what he was saying, Denham led the way, first to the\\r\\nRock Garden, and then to the Orchid House.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor him there was safety in the direction which the talk had taken.\\r\\nHis emphasis might come from feelings more personal than those science\\r\\nroused in him, but it was disguised, and naturally he found it easy\\r\\nto expound and explain. Nevertheless, when he saw Katharine among the\\r\\norchids, her beauty strangely emphasized by the fantastic plants, which\\r\\nseemed to peer and gape at her from striped hoods and fleshy throats,\\r\\nhis ardor for botany waned, and a more complex feeling replaced it. She\\r\\nfell silent. The orchids seemed to suggest absorbing reflections. In\\r\\ndefiance of the rules she stretched her ungloved hand and touched one.\\r\\nThe sight of the rubies upon her finger affected him so disagreeably\\r\\nthat he started and turned away. But next moment he controlled himself;\\r\\nhe looked at her taking in one strange shape after another with the\\r\\ncontemplative, considering gaze of a person who sees not exactly what is\\r\\nbefore him, but gropes in regions that lie beyond it. The far-away\\r\\nlook entirely lacked self-consciousness. Denham doubted whether she\\r\\nremembered his presence. He could recall himself, of course, by a word\\r\\nor a movement--but why? She was happier thus. She needed nothing that\\r\\nhe could give her. And for him, too, perhaps, it was best to keep aloof,\\r\\nonly to know that she existed, to preserve what he already had--perfect,\\r\\nremote, and unbroken. Further, her still look, standing among the\\r\\norchids in that hot atmosphere, strangely illustrated some scene that\\r\\nhe had imagined in his room at home. The sight, mingling with his\\r\\nrecollection, kept him silent when the door was shut and they were\\r\\nwalking on again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though she did not speak, Katharine had an uneasy sense that silence\\r\\non her part was selfishness. It was selfish of her to continue, as she\\r\\nwished to do, a discussion of subjects not remotely connected with any\\r\\nhuman beings. She roused herself to consider their exact position upon\\r\\nthe turbulent map of the emotions. Oh yes--it was a question whether\\r\\nRalph Denham should live in the country and write a book; it was getting\\r\\nlate; they must waste no more time; Cassandra arrived to-night for\\r\\ndinner; she flinched and roused herself, and discovered that she ought\\r\\nto be holding something in her hands. But they were empty. She held them\\r\\nout with an exclamation.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve left my bag somewhere--where?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The gardens had no points of the\\r\\ncompass, so far as she was concerned. She had been walking for the most\\r\\npart on grass--that was all she knew. Even the road to the Orchid House\\r\\nhad now split itself into three. But there was no bag in the Orchid\\r\\nHouse. It must, therefore, have been left upon the seat. They retraced\\r\\ntheir steps in the preoccupied manner of people who have to think\\r\\nabout something that is lost. What did this bag look like? What did it\\r\\ncontain?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA purse--a ticket--some letters, papers,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine counted, becoming\\r\\nmore agitated as she recalled the list. Denham went on quickly in\\r\\nadvance of her, and she heard him shout that he had found it before she\\r\\nreached the seat. In order to make sure that all was safe she spread the\\r\\ncontents on her knee. It was a queer collection, Denham thought, gazing\\r\\nwith the deepest interest. Loose gold coins were tangled in a narrow\\r\\nstrip of lace; there were letters which somehow suggested the extreme of\\r\\nintimacy; there were two or three keys, and lists of commissions against\\r\\nwhich crosses were set at intervals. But she did not seem satisfied\\r\\nuntil she had made sure of a certain paper so folded that Denham could\\r\\nnot judge what it contained. In her relief and gratitude she began at\\r\\nonce to say that she had been thinking over what Denham had told her of\\r\\nhis plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe cut her short. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t letÃ¢\\x80\\x99s discuss that dreary business.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut I thought--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a dreary business. I ought never to have bothered you--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you decided, then?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made an impatient sound. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not a thing that matters.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could only say rather flatly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI mean it matters to me, but it matters to no one else. Anyhow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ncontinued, more amiably, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI see no reason why you should be bothered\\r\\nwith other peopleÃ¢\\x80\\x99s nuisances.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe supposed that she had let him see too clearly her weariness of this\\r\\nside of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been absent-minded,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she began, remembering how often\\r\\nWilliam had brought this charge against her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou have a good deal to make you absent-minded,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied, flushing. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she contradicted herself. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNothing\\r\\nparticular, I mean. But I was thinking about plants. I was enjoying\\r\\nmyself. In fact, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve seldom enjoyed an afternoon more. But I want to\\r\\nhear what youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve settled, if you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mind telling me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all settled,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m going to this infernal cottage\\r\\nto write a worthless book.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow I envy you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied, with the utmost sincerity.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, cottages are to be had for fifteen shillings a week.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCottages are to be had--yes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe question is--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She\\r\\nchecked herself. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTwo rooms are all I should want,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued, with\\r\\na curious sigh; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cone for eating, one for sleeping. Oh, but I should like\\r\\nanother, a large one at the top, and a little garden where one could\\r\\ngrow flowers. A path--so--down to a river, or up to a wood, and the sea\\r\\nnot very far off, so that one could hear the waves at night. Ships just\\r\\nvanishing on the horizon--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She broke off. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShall you be near the sea?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy notion of perfect happiness,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he began, not replying to her\\r\\nquestion, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis to live as youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve said.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, now you can. You will work, I suppose,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nwork all the morning and again after tea and perhaps at night. You wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nhave people always coming about you to interrupt.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow far can one live alone?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHave you tried ever?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOnce for three weeks,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMy father and mother were in\\r\\nItaly, and something happened so that I couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t join them. For three\\r\\nweeks I lived entirely by myself, and the only person I spoke to was a\\r\\nstranger in a shop where I lunched--a man with a beard. Then I went back\\r\\nto my room by myself and--well, I did what I liked. It doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t make me\\r\\nout an amiable character, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t endure\\r\\nliving with other people. An occasional man with a beard is interesting;\\r\\nheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s detached; he lets me go my way, and we know we shall never meet\\r\\nagain. Therefore, we are perfectly sincere--a thing not possible with\\r\\noneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s friends.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNonsense,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham replied abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy Ã¢\\x80\\x98nonsenseÃ¢\\x80\\x99?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mean what you say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he expostulated.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re very positive,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, laughing and looking at him. How\\r\\narbitrary, hot-tempered, and imperious he was! He had asked her to come\\r\\nto Kew to advise him; he then told her that he had settled the question\\r\\nalready; he then proceeded to find fault with her. He was the very\\r\\nopposite of William Rodney, she thought; he was shabby, his clothes\\r\\nwere badly made, he was ill versed in the amenities of life; he was\\r\\ntongue-tied and awkward to the verge of obliterating his real character.\\r\\nHe was awkwardly silent; he was awkwardly emphatic. And yet she liked\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mean what I say,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she repeated good-humoredly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell--?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI doubt whether you make absolute sincerity your standard in life,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nanswered significantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe flushed. He had penetrated at once to the weak spot--her engagement,\\r\\nand had reason for what he said. He was not altogether justified now, at\\r\\nany rate, she was glad to remember; but she could not enlighten him\\r\\nand must bear his insinuations, though from the lips of a man who\\r\\nhad behaved as he had behaved their force should not have been sharp.\\r\\nNevertheless, what he said had its force, she mused; partly because he\\r\\nseemed unconscious of his own lapse in the case of Mary Datchet, and\\r\\nthus baffled her insight; partly because he always spoke with force, for\\r\\nwhat reason she did not yet feel certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAbsolute sincerity is rather difficult, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you think?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she inquired,\\r\\nwith a touch of irony.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere are people one credits even with that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied a little\\r\\nvaguely. He was ashamed of his savage wish to hurt her, and yet it was\\r\\nnot for the sake of hurting her, who was beyond his shafts, but in order\\r\\nto mortify his own incredibly reckless impulse of abandonment to the\\r\\nspirit which seemed, at moments, about to rush him to the uttermost ends\\r\\nof the earth. She affected him beyond the scope of his wildest dreams.\\r\\nHe seemed to see that beneath the quiet surface of her manner, which was\\r\\nalmost pathetically at hand and within reach for all the trivial demands\\r\\nof daily life, there was a spirit which she reserved or repressed for\\r\\nsome reason either of loneliness or--could it be possible--of love. Was\\r\\nit given to Rodney to see her unmasked, unrestrained, unconscious of her\\r\\nduties? a creature of uncalculating passion and instinctive freedom? No;\\r\\nhe refused to believe it. It was in her loneliness that Katharine was\\r\\nunreserved. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI went back to my room by myself and I did--what I liked.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n She had said that to him, and in saying it had given him a glimpse of\\r\\npossibilities, even of confidences, as if he might be the one to share\\r\\nher loneliness, the mere hint of which made his heart beat faster and\\r\\nhis brain spin. He checked himself as brutally as he could. He saw her\\r\\nredden, and in the irony of her reply he heard her resentment.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began slipping his smooth, silver watch in his pocket, in the hope\\r\\nthat somehow he might help himself back to that calm and fatalistic mood\\r\\nwhich had been his when he looked at its face upon the bank of the lake,\\r\\nfor that mood must, at whatever cost, be the mood of his intercourse\\r\\nwith Katharine. He had spoken of gratitude and acquiescence in the\\r\\nletter which he had never sent, and now all the force of his character\\r\\nmust make good those vows in her presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe, thus challenged, tried meanwhile to define her points. She wished\\r\\nto make Denham understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you see that if you have no relations with people itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s easier to\\r\\nbe honest with them?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she inquired. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThat is what I meant. One neednÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ncajole them; oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s under no obligation to them. Surely you must have\\r\\nfound with your own family that itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s impossible to discuss what matters\\r\\nto you most because youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re all herded together, because youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re in a\\r\\nconspiracy, because the position is false--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Her reasoning suspended\\r\\nitself a little inconclusively, for the subject was complex, and she\\r\\nfound herself in ignorance whether Denham had a family or not. Denham\\r\\nwas agreed with her as to the destructiveness of the family system, but\\r\\nhe did not wish to discuss the problem at that moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned to a problem which was of greater interest to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m convinced,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat there are cases in which perfect\\r\\nsincerity is possible--cases where thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no relationship, though the\\r\\npeople live together, if you like, where each is free, where thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no\\r\\nobligation upon either side.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFor a time perhaps,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she agreed, a little despondently. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut\\r\\nobligations always grow up. There are feelings to be considered. People\\r\\narenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t simple, and though they may mean to be reasonable, they\\r\\nendÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--in the condition in which she found herself, she meant, but added\\r\\nlamely--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cin a muddle.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham instantly intervened, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthey donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t make themselves\\r\\nunderstood at the beginning. I could undertake, at this instant,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ncontinued, with a reasonable intonation which did much credit to his\\r\\nself-control, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto lay down terms for a friendship which should be\\r\\nperfectly sincere and perfectly straightforward.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was curious to hear them, but, besides feeling that the topic\\r\\nconcealed dangers better known to her than to him, she was reminded\\r\\nby his tone of his curious abstract declaration upon the Embankment.\\r\\nAnything that hinted at love for the moment alarmed her; it was as much\\r\\nan infliction to her as the rubbing of a skinless wound.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he went on, without waiting for her invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn the first place, such a friendship must be unemotional,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he laid it\\r\\ndown emphatically. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAt least, on both sides it must be understood that\\r\\nif either chooses to fall in love, he or she does so entirely at his\\r\\nown risk. Neither is under any obligation to the other. They must be\\r\\nat liberty to break or to alter at any moment. They must be able to say\\r\\nwhatever they wish to say. All this must be understood.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd they gain something worth having?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a risk--of course itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a risk,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied. The word\\r\\n\\r\\nwas one that she had been using frequently in her arguments with herself\\r\\nof late.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the only way--if you think friendship worth having,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nconcluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps under those conditions it might be,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said reflectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthose are the terms of the friendship I wish to offer\\r\\nyou.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She had known that this was coming, but, none the less, felt a\\r\\nlittle shock, half of pleasure, half of reluctance, when she heard the\\r\\nformal statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should like it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she began, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWould Rodney mind?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh no,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no, it isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went on, and again came to an end. She had\\r\\nbeen touched by the unreserved and yet ceremonious way in which he had\\r\\nmade what he called his offer of terms, but if he was generous it was\\r\\nthe more necessary for her to be cautious. They would find themselves\\r\\nin difficulties, she speculated; but, at this point, which was not very\\r\\nfar, after all, upon the road of caution, her foresight deserted her.\\r\\nShe sought for some definite catastrophe into which they must inevitably\\r\\nplunge. But she could think of none. It seemed to her that these\\r\\ncatastrophes were fictitious; life went on and on--life was different\\r\\naltogether from what people said. And not only was she at an end of her\\r\\nstock of caution, but it seemed suddenly altogether superfluous. Surely\\r\\nif any one could take care of himself, Ralph Denham could; he had told\\r\\nher that he did not love her. And, further, she meditated, walking on\\r\\nbeneath the beech-trees and swinging her umbrella, as in her thought she\\r\\nwas accustomed to complete freedom, why should she perpetually apply so\\r\\ndifferent a standard to her behavior in practice? Why, she reflected,\\r\\nshould there be this perpetual disparity between the thought and the\\r\\naction, between the life of solitude and the life of society, this\\r\\nastonishing precipice on one side of which the soul was active and in\\r\\nbroad daylight, on the other side of which it was contemplative and dark\\r\\nas night? Was it not possible to step from one to the other, erect, and\\r\\nwithout essential change? Was this not the chance he offered her--the\\r\\nrare and wonderful chance of friendship? At any rate, she told Denham,\\r\\nwith a sigh in which he heard both impatience and relief, that she\\r\\nagreed; she thought him right; she would accept his terms of friendship.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cletÃ¢\\x80\\x99s go and have tea.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, these principles having been laid down, a great lightness of\\r\\nspirit showed itself in both of them. They were both convinced that\\r\\nsomething of profound importance had been settled, and could now give\\r\\ntheir attention to their tea and the Gardens. They wandered in and out\\r\\nof glass-houses, saw lilies swimming in tanks, breathed in the scent\\r\\nof thousands of carnations, and compared their respective tastes in the\\r\\nmatter of trees and lakes. While talking exclusively of what they saw,\\r\\nso that any one might have overheard them, they felt that the compact\\r\\nbetween them was made firmer and deeper by the number of people who\\r\\npassed them and suspected nothing of the kind. The question of RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncottage and future was not mentioned again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the old coaches, with their gay panels and the guardÃ¢\\x80\\x99s horn,\\r\\nand the humors of the box and the vicissitudes of the road, have long\\r\\nmoldered into dust so far as they were matter, and are preserved in the\\r\\nprinted pages of our novelists so far as they partook of the spirit,\\r\\na journey to London by express train can still be a very pleasant and\\r\\nromantic adventure. Cassandra Otway, at the age of twenty-two, could\\r\\nimagine few things more pleasant. Satiated with months of green fields\\r\\nas she was, the first row of artisansÃ¢\\x80\\x99 villas on the outskirts of London\\r\\nseemed to have something serious about it, which positively increased\\r\\nthe importance of every person in the railway carriage, and even, to her\\r\\nimpressionable mind, quickened the speed of the train and gave a note of\\r\\nstern authority to the shriek of the engine-whistle. They were bound for\\r\\nLondon; they must have precedence of all traffic not similarly destined.\\r\\nA different demeanor was necessary directly one stepped out upon\\r\\nLiverpool Street platform, and became one of those preoccupied and hasty\\r\\ncitizens for whose needs innumerable taxi-cabs, motor-omnibuses, and\\r\\nunderground railways were in waiting. She did her best to look\\r\\ndignified and preoccupied too, but as the cab carried her away, with\\r\\na determination which alarmed her a little, she became more and more\\r\\nforgetful of her station as a citizen of London, and turned her head\\r\\nfrom one window to another, picking up eagerly a building on this side\\r\\nor a street scene on that to feed her intense curiosity. And yet, while\\r\\nthe drive lasted no one was real, nothing was ordinary; the crowds, the\\r\\nGovernment buildings, the tide of men and women washing the base of the\\r\\ngreat glass windows, were all generalized, and affected her as if she\\r\\nsaw them on the stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these feelings were sustained and partly inspired by the fact that\\r\\nher journey took her straight to the center of her most romantic world.\\r\\nA thousand times in the midst of her pastoral landscape her thoughts\\r\\ntook this precise road, were admitted to the house in Chelsea, and went\\r\\ndirectly upstairs to KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s room, where, invisible themselves,\\r\\nthey had the better chance of feasting upon the privacy of the roomÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nadorable and mysterious mistress. Cassandra adored her cousin; the\\r\\nadoration might have been foolish, but was saved from that excess\\r\\nand lent an engaging charm by the volatile nature of CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ntemperament. She had adored a great many things and people in the\\r\\ncourse of twenty-two years; she had been alternately the pride and the\\r\\ndesperation of her teachers. She had worshipped architecture and music,\\r\\nnatural history and humanity, literature and art, but always at the\\r\\nheight of her enthusiasm, which was accompanied by a brilliant degree\\r\\nof accomplishment, she changed her mind and bought, surreptitiously,\\r\\nanother grammar. The terrible results which governesses had predicted\\r\\nfrom such mental dissipation were certainly apparent now that Cassandra\\r\\nwas twenty-two, and had never passed an examination, and daily\\r\\nshowed herself less and less capable of passing one. The more serious\\r\\nprediction that she could never possibly earn her living was also\\r\\nverified. But from all these short strands of different accomplishments\\r\\nCassandra wove for herself an attitude, a cast of mind, which, if\\r\\nuseless, was found by some people to have the not despicable virtues\\r\\nof vivacity and freshness. Katharine, for example, thought her a most\\r\\ncharming companion. The cousins seemed to assemble between them a great\\r\\nrange of qualities which are never found united in one person and\\r\\nseldom in half a dozen people. Where Katharine was simple, Cassandra was\\r\\ncomplex; where Katharine was solid and direct, Cassandra was vague and\\r\\nevasive. In short, they represented very well the manly and the womanly\\r\\nsides of the feminine nature, and, for foundation, there was the\\r\\nprofound unity of common blood between them. If Cassandra adored\\r\\nKatharine she was incapable of adoring any one without refreshing her\\r\\nspirit with frequent draughts of raillery and criticism, and Katharine\\r\\nenjoyed her laughter at least as much as her respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nRespect was certainly uppermost in CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mind at the present\\r\\nmoment. KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s engagement had appealed to her imagination as the\\r\\nfirst engagement in a circle of contemporaries is apt to appeal to the\\r\\nimaginations of the others; it was solemn, beautiful, and mysterious;\\r\\nit gave both parties the important air of those who have been initiated\\r\\ninto some rite which is still concealed from the rest of the group.\\r\\nFor KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sake Cassandra thought William a most distinguished and\\r\\ninteresting character, and welcomed first his conversation and then his\\r\\nmanuscript as the marks of a friendship which it flattered and delighted\\r\\nher to inspire.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine was still out when she arrived at Cheyne Walk. After greeting\\r\\nher uncle and aunt and receiving, as usual, a present of two sovereigns\\r\\nfor Ã¢\\x80\\x9ccab fares and dissipationÃ¢\\x80\\x9d from Uncle Trevor, whose favorite niece\\r\\nshe was, she changed her dress and wandered into KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s room to\\r\\nawait her. What a great looking-glass Katharine had, she thought, and\\r\\nhow mature all the arrangements upon the dressing-table were compared to\\r\\nwhat she was used to at home. Glancing round, she thought that the bills\\r\\nstuck upon a skewer and stood for ornament upon the mantelpiece were\\r\\nastonishingly like Katharine, There wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t a photograph of William\\r\\nanywhere to be seen. The room, with its combination of luxury and\\r\\nbareness, its silk dressing-gowns and crimson slippers, its shabby\\r\\ncarpet and bare walls, had a powerful air of Katharine herself; she\\r\\nstood in the middle of the room and enjoyed the sensation; and then,\\r\\nwith a desire to finger what her cousin was in the habit of fingering,\\r\\nCassandra began to take down the books which stood in a row upon the\\r\\nshelf above the bed. In most houses this shelf is the ledge upon which\\r\\nthe last relics of religious belief lodge themselves as if, late at\\r\\nnight, in the heart of privacy, people, skeptical by day, find solace in\\r\\nsipping one draught of the old charm for such sorrows or perplexities\\r\\nas may steal from their hiding-places in the dark. But there was no\\r\\nhymn-book here. By their battered covers and enigmatical contents,\\r\\nCassandra judged them to be old school-books belonging to Uncle Trevor,\\r\\nand piously, though eccentrically, preserved by his daughter. There was\\r\\nno end, she thought, to the unexpectedness of Katharine. She had once\\r\\nhad a passion for geometry herself, and, curled upon KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s quilt,\\r\\nshe became absorbed in trying to remember how far she had forgotten what\\r\\nshe once knew. Katharine, coming in a little later, found her deep in\\r\\nthis characteristic pursuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra exclaimed, shaking the book at her cousin, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmy\\r\\nwhole lifeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s changed from this moment! I must write the manÃ¢\\x80\\x99s name down\\r\\nat once, or I shall forget--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhose name, what book, which life was changed Katharine proceeded to\\r\\nascertain. She began to lay aside her clothes hurriedly, for she was\\r\\nvery late.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMay I sit and watch you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra asked, shutting up her book. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI got\\r\\nready on purpose.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re ready, are you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, half turning in the midst\\r\\nof her operations, and looking at Cassandra, who sat, clasping her\\r\\nknees, on the edge of the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere are people dining here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, taking in the effect of\\r\\nCassandra from a new point of view. After an interval, the distinction,\\r\\nthe irregular charm, of the small face with its long tapering nose\\r\\nand its bright oval eyes were very notable. The hair rose up off\\r\\nthe forehead rather stiffly, and, given a more careful treatment by\\r\\nhairdressers and dressmakers, the light angular figure might possess a\\r\\nlikeness to a French lady of distinction in the eighteenth century.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhoÃ¢\\x80\\x99s coming to dinner?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra asked, anticipating further\\r\\npossibilities of rapture.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s William, and, I believe, Aunt Eleanor and Uncle Aubrey.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m so glad William is coming. Did he tell you that he sent me his\\r\\nmanuscript? I think itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s wonderful--I think heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s almost good enough for\\r\\nyou, Katharine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou shall sit next to him and tell him what you think of him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI shanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t dare do that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra asserted.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy? YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not afraid of him, are you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA little--because heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s connected with you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut then, with your well-known fidelity, considering that youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re\\r\\nstaying here at least a fortnight, you wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have any illusions left\\r\\nabout me by the time you go. I give you a week, Cassandra. I shall see\\r\\nmy power fading day by day. Now itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s at the climax; but to-morrow itÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nhave begun to fade. What am I to wear, I wonder? Find me a blue dress,\\r\\nCassandra, over there in the long wardrobe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke disconnectedly, handling brush and comb, and pulling out the\\r\\nlittle drawers in her dressing-table and leaving them open. Cassandra,\\r\\nsitting on the bed behind her, saw the reflection of her cousinÃ¢\\x80\\x99s face\\r\\nin the looking-glass. The face in the looking-glass was serious and\\r\\nintent, apparently occupied with other things besides the straightness\\r\\nof the parting which, however, was being driven as straight as a Roman\\r\\nroad through the dark hair. Cassandra was impressed again by KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmaturity; and, as she enveloped herself in the blue dress which filled\\r\\nalmost the whole of the long looking-glass with blue light and made it\\r\\nthe frame of a picture, holding not only the slightly moving effigy of\\r\\nthe beautiful woman, but shapes and colors of objects reflected from\\r\\nthe background, Cassandra thought that no sight had ever been quite so\\r\\nromantic. It was all in keeping with the room and the house, and the\\r\\ncity round them; for her ears had not yet ceased to notice the hum of\\r\\ndistant wheels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went downstairs rather late, in spite of KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s extreme speed\\r\\nin getting ready. To CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s ears the buzz of voices inside the\\r\\ndrawing-room was like the tuning up of the instruments of the orchestra.\\r\\nIt seemed to her that there were numbers of people in the room, and that\\r\\nthey were strangers, and that they were beautiful and dressed with the\\r\\ngreatest distinction, although they proved to be mostly her relations,\\r\\nand the distinction of their clothing was confined, in the eyes of an\\r\\nimpartial observer, to the white waistcoat which Rodney wore. But they\\r\\nall rose simultaneously, which was by itself impressive, and they all\\r\\nexclaimed, and shook hands, and she was introduced to Mr. Peyton, and\\r\\nthe door sprang open, and dinner was announced, and they filed off,\\r\\nWilliam Rodney offering her his slightly bent black arm, as she had\\r\\nsecretly hoped he would. In short, had the scene been looked at\\r\\nonly through her eyes, it must have been described as one of magical\\r\\nbrilliancy. The pattern of the soup-plates, the stiff folds of the\\r\\nnapkins, which rose by the side of each plate in the shape of arum\\r\\nlilies, the long sticks of bread tied with pink ribbon, the silver\\r\\ndishes and the sea-colored champagne glasses, with the flakes of gold\\r\\ncongealed in their stems--all these details, together with a curiously\\r\\npervasive smell of kid gloves, contributed to her exhilaration, which\\r\\nmust be repressed, however, because she was grown up, and the world held\\r\\nno more for her to marvel at.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world held no more for her to marvel at, it is true; but it held\\r\\nother people; and each other person possessed in CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mind some\\r\\nfragment of what privately she called Ã¢\\x80\\x9creality.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d It was a gift that they\\r\\nwould impart if you asked them for it, and thus no dinner-party could\\r\\npossibly be dull, and little Mr. Peyton on her right and William Rodney\\r\\non her left were in equal measure endowed with the quality which seemed\\r\\nto her so unmistakable and so precious that the way people neglected to\\r\\ndemand it was a constant source of surprise to her. She scarcely knew,\\r\\nindeed, whether she was talking to Mr. Peyton or to William Rodney.\\r\\nBut to one who, by degrees, assumed the shape of an elderly man with\\r\\na mustache, she described how she had arrived in London that very\\r\\nafternoon, and how she had taken a cab and driven through the streets.\\r\\nMr. Peyton, an editor of fifty years, bowed his bald head repeatedly,\\r\\nwith apparent understanding. At least, he understood that she was very\\r\\nyoung and pretty, and saw that she was excited, though he could not\\r\\ngather at once from her words or remember from his own experience what\\r\\nthere was to be excited about. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWere there any buds on the trees?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nasked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhich line did she travel by?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was cut short in these amiable inquiries by her desire to know\\r\\nwhether he was one of those who read, or one of those who look out of\\r\\nthe window? Mr. Peyton was by no means sure which he did. He rather\\r\\nthought he did both. He was told that he had made a most dangerous\\r\\nconfession. She could deduce his entire history from that one fact. He\\r\\nchallenged her to proceed; and she proclaimed him a Liberal Member of\\r\\nParliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam, nominally engaged in a desultory conversation with Aunt\\r\\nEleanor, heard every word, and taking advantage of the fact that elderly\\r\\nladies have little continuity of conversation, at least with those whom\\r\\nthey esteem for their youth and their sex, he asserted his presence by a\\r\\nvery nervous laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra turned to him directly. She was enchanted to find that,\\r\\ninstantly and with such ease, another of these fascinating beings was\\r\\noffering untold wealth for her extraction.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no doubt what YOU do in a railway carriage, William,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said,\\r\\nmaking use in her pleasure of his first name. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou never ONCE look out\\r\\nof the window; you read ALL the time.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd what facts do you deduce from that?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Peyton asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, that heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a poet, of course,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Cassandra. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut I must confess\\r\\nthat I knew that before, so it isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t fair. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got your manuscript with\\r\\nme,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went on, disregarding Mr. Peyton in a shameless way. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got\\r\\nall sorts of things I want to ask you about it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam inclined his head and tried to conceal the pleasure that her\\r\\nremark gave him. But the pleasure was not unalloyed. However susceptible\\r\\nto flattery William might be, he would never tolerate it from people who\\r\\nshowed a gross or emotional taste in literature, and if Cassandra erred\\r\\neven slightly from what he considered essential in this respect he\\r\\nwould express his discomfort by flinging out his hands and wrinkling his\\r\\nforehead; he would find no pleasure in her flattery after that.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFirst of all,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she proceeded, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI want to know why you chose to write a\\r\\nplay?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh! You mean itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not dramatic?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI mean that I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see what it would gain by being acted. But then\\r\\ndoes Shakespeare gain? Henry and I are always arguing about Shakespeare.\\r\\nIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m certain heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s wrong, but I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t prove it because IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve only seen\\r\\nShakespeare acted once in Lincoln. But IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m quite positive,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\ninsisted, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat Shakespeare wrote for the stage.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re perfectly right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI was hoping you were on\\r\\nthat side. HenryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s wrong--entirely wrong. Of course, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve failed, as all\\r\\nthe moderns fail. Dear, dear, I wish IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d consulted you before.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this point they proceeded to go over, as far as memory served them,\\r\\nthe different aspects of RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s drama. She said nothing that jarred\\r\\nupon him, and untrained daring had the power to stimulate experience\\r\\nto such an extent that Rodney was frequently seen to hold his fork\\r\\nsuspended before him, while he debated the first principles of the art.\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery thought to herself that she had never seen him to such\\r\\nadvantage; yes, he was somehow different; he reminded her of some one\\r\\nwho was dead, some one who was distinguished--she had forgotten his\\r\\nname.\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s voice rose high in its excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve not read Ã¢\\x80\\x98The IdiotÃ¢\\x80\\x99!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve read Ã¢\\x80\\x98War and PeaceÃ¢\\x80\\x99,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William replied, a little testily.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x98WAR AND PEACEÃ¢\\x80\\x99!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she echoed, in a tone of derision.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI confess I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand the Russians.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShake hands! Shake hands!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d boomed Uncle Aubrey from across the table.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNeither do I. And I hazard the opinion that they donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t themselves.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old gentleman had ruled a large part of the Indian Empire, but he\\r\\nwas in the habit of saying that he had rather have written the works of\\r\\nDickens. The table now took possession of a subject much to its liking.\\r\\nAunt Eleanor showed premonitory signs of pronouncing an opinion.\\r\\nAlthough she had blunted her taste upon some form of philanthropy for\\r\\ntwenty-five years, she had a fine natural instinct for an upstart or a\\r\\npretender, and knew to a hairbreadth what literature should be and what\\r\\nit should not be. She was born to the knowledge, and scarcely thought it\\r\\na matter to be proud of.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cInsanity is not a fit subject for fiction,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she announced positively.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the well-known case of Hamlet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hilbery interposed, in his\\r\\nleisurely, half-humorous tones.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, but poetryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s different, Trevor,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Aunt Eleanor, as if she had\\r\\nspecial authority from Shakespeare to say so. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDifferent altogether.\\r\\nAnd IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve never thought, for my part, that Hamlet was as mad as they make\\r\\nout. What is your opinion, Mr. Peyton?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d For, as there was a minister of\\r\\nliterature present in the person of the editor of an esteemed review,\\r\\nshe deferred to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Peyton leant a little back in his chair, and, putting his head\\r\\nrather on one side, observed that that was a question that he had never\\r\\nbeen able to answer entirely to his satisfaction. There was much to be\\r\\nsaid on both sides, but as he considered upon which side he should say\\r\\nit, Mrs. Hilbery broke in upon his judicious meditations.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLovely, lovely Ophelia!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat a wonderful power it\\r\\nis--poetry! I wake up in the morning all bedraggled; thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a yellow\\r\\nfog outside; little Emily turns on the electric light when she brings\\r\\nme my tea, and says, Ã¢\\x80\\x98Oh, maÃ¢\\x80\\x99am, the waterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s frozen in the cistern, and\\r\\ncookÃ¢\\x80\\x99s cut her finger to the bone.Ã¢\\x80\\x99 And then I open a little green book,\\r\\nand the birds are singing, the stars shining, the flowers twinkling--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n She looked about her as if these presences had suddenly manifested\\r\\nthemselves round her dining-room table.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHas the cook cut her finger badly?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Aunt Eleanor demanded, addressing\\r\\nherself naturally to Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, the cookÃ¢\\x80\\x99s finger is only my way of putting it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Hilbery.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut if she had cut her arm off, Katharine would have sewn it on again,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she remarked, with an affectionate glance at her daughter, who looked,\\r\\nshe thought, a little sad. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut what horrid, horrid thoughts,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she wound\\r\\nup, laying down her napkin and pushing her chair back. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome, let us\\r\\nfind something more cheerful to talk about upstairs.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUpstairs in the drawing-room Cassandra found fresh sources of pleasure,\\r\\nfirst in the distinguished and expectant look of the room, and then in\\r\\nthe chance of exercising her divining-rod upon a new assortment of human\\r\\nbeings. But the low tones of the women, their meditative silences, the\\r\\nbeauty which, to her at least, shone even from black satin and the knobs\\r\\nof amber which encircled elderly necks, changed her wish to chatter to\\r\\na more subdued desire merely to watch and to whisper. She entered\\r\\nwith delight into an atmosphere in which private matters were being\\r\\ninterchanged freely, almost in monosyllables, by the older women who now\\r\\naccepted her as one of themselves. Her expression became very gentle and\\r\\nsympathetic, as if she, too, were full of solicitude for the world which\\r\\nwas somehow being cared for, managed and deprecated by Aunt Maggie and\\r\\nAunt Eleanor. After a time she perceived that Katharine was outside the\\r\\ncommunity in some way, and, suddenly, she threw aside her wisdom and\\r\\ngentleness and concern and began to laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat are you laughing at?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nA joke so foolish and unfilial wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t worth explaining.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt was nothing--ridiculous--in the worst of taste, but still, if you\\r\\nhalf shut your eyes and looked--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine half shut her eyes and\\r\\nlooked, but she looked in the wrong direction, and Cassandra laughed\\r\\nmore than ever, and was still laughing and doing her best to explain in\\r\\na whisper that Aunt Eleanor, through half-shut eyes, was like the parrot\\r\\nin the cage at Stogdon House, when the gentlemen came in and Rodney\\r\\nwalked straight up to them and wanted to know what they were laughing\\r\\nat.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI utterly refuse to tell you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra replied, standing up straight,\\r\\nclasping her hands in front of her, and facing him. Her mockery was\\r\\ndelicious to him. He had not even for a second the fear that she had\\r\\nbeen laughing at him. She was laughing because life was so adorable, so\\r\\nenchanting.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, but youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re cruel to make me feel the barbarity of my sex,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nreplied, drawing his feet together and pressing his finger-tips upon an\\r\\nimaginary opera-hat or malacca cane. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWeÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been discussing all sorts\\r\\nof dull things, and now I shall never know what I want to know more than\\r\\nanything in the world.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t deceive us for a minute!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she cried. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot for a second.\\r\\nWe both know that youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been enjoying yourself immensely. HasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t he,\\r\\nKatharine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s speaking the truth. He doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t care\\r\\nmuch for politics.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer words, though spoken simply, produced a curious change in the light,\\r\\nsparkling atmosphere. William at once lost his look of animation and\\r\\nsaid seriously:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI detest politics.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think any man has the right to say that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Cassandra,\\r\\nalmost severely.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI agree. I mean that I detest politicians,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he corrected himself\\r\\nquickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou see, I believe Cassandra is what they call a Feminist,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine\\r\\nwent on. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOr rather, she was a Feminist six months ago, but itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no good\\r\\nsupposing that she is now what she was then. That is one of her greatest\\r\\ncharms in my eyes. One never can tell.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She smiled at her as an elder\\r\\nsister might smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine, you make one feel so horribly small!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not what she means,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney interposed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI quite agree\\r\\nthat women have an immense advantage over us there. One misses a lot by\\r\\nattempting to know things thoroughly.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe knows Greek thoroughly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut then he also knows a\\r\\ngood deal about painting, and a certain amount about music. HeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s very\\r\\ncultivated--perhaps the most cultivated person I know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd poetry,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra added.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I was forgetting his play,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine remarked, and turning her\\r\\nhead as though she saw something that needed her attention in a far\\r\\ncorner of the room, she left them.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment they stood silent, after what seemed a deliberate\\r\\nintroduction to each other, and Cassandra watched her crossing the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHenry,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said next moment, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwould say that a stage ought to be no\\r\\nbigger than this drawing-room. He wants there to be singing and dancing\\r\\nas well as acting--only all the opposite of Wagner--you understand?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sat down, and Katharine, turning when she reached the window, saw\\r\\nWilliam with his hand raised in gesticulation and his mouth open, as if\\r\\nready to speak the moment Cassandra ceased.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s duty, whether it was to pull a curtain or move a chair, was\\r\\neither forgotten or discharged, but she continued to stand by the window\\r\\nwithout doing anything. The elderly people were all grouped together\\r\\nround the fire. They seemed an independent, middle-aged community busy\\r\\nwith its own concerns. They were telling stories very well and listening\\r\\nto them very graciously. But for her there was no obvious employment.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf anybody says anything, I shall say that IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m looking at the river,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she thought, for in her slavery to her family traditions, she was ready\\r\\nto pay for her transgression with some plausible falsehood. She pushed\\r\\naside the blind and looked at the river. But it was a dark night and the\\r\\nwater was barely visible. Cabs were passing, and couples were loitering\\r\\nslowly along the road, keeping as close to the railings as possible,\\r\\nthough the trees had as yet no leaves to cast shadow upon their\\r\\nembraces. Katharine, thus withdrawn, felt her loneliness. The evening\\r\\nhad been one of pain, offering her, minute after minute, plainer proof\\r\\nthat things would fall out as she had foreseen. She had faced tones,\\r\\ngestures, glances; she knew, with her back to them, that William, even\\r\\nnow, was plunging deeper and deeper into the delight of unexpected\\r\\nunderstanding with Cassandra. He had almost told her that he was finding\\r\\nit infinitely better than he could have believed. She looked out of\\r\\nthe window, sternly determined to forget private misfortunes, to forget\\r\\nherself, to forget individual lives. With her eyes upon the dark sky,\\r\\nvoices reached her from the room in which she was standing. She heard\\r\\nthem as if they came from people in another world, a world antecedent to\\r\\nher world, a world that was the prelude, the antechamber to reality; it\\r\\nwas as if, lately dead, she heard the living talking. The dream nature\\r\\nof our life had never been more apparent to her, never had life been\\r\\nmore certainly an affair of four walls, whose objects existed only\\r\\nwithin the range of lights and fires, beyond which lay nothing, or\\r\\nnothing more than darkness. She seemed physically to have stepped beyond\\r\\nthe region where the light of illusion still makes it desirable to\\r\\npossess, to love, to struggle. And yet her melancholy brought her no\\r\\nserenity. She still heard the voices within the room. She was still\\r\\ntormented by desires. She wished to be beyond their range. She wished\\r\\ninconsistently enough that she could find herself driving rapidly\\r\\nthrough the streets; she was even anxious to be with some one who, after\\r\\na momentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s groping, took a definite shape and solidified into the person\\r\\nof Mary Datchet. She drew the curtains so that the draperies met in deep\\r\\nfolds in the middle of the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, there she is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Hilbery, who was standing swaying affably\\r\\nfrom side to side, with his back to the fire. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCome here, Katharine.\\r\\nI couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see where youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d got to--our children,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he observed\\r\\nparenthetically, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chave their uses--I want you to go to my study,\\r\\nKatharine; go to the third shelf on the right-hand side of the door;\\r\\ntake down Ã¢\\x80\\x98TrelawnyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Recollections of ShelleyÃ¢\\x80\\x99; bring it to me. Then,\\r\\nPeyton, you will have to admit to the assembled company that you have\\r\\nbeen mistaken.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cÃ¢\\x80\\x98TrelawnyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Recollections of Shelley.Ã¢\\x80\\x99 The third shelf on the right of\\r\\nthe door,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine repeated. After all, one does not check children in\\r\\ntheir play, or rouse sleepers from their dreams. She passed William and\\r\\nCassandra on her way to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cStop, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said William, speaking almost as if he were conscious\\r\\nof her against his will. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet me go.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He rose, after a secondÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhesitation, and she understood that it cost him an effort. She knelt\\r\\none knee upon the sofa where Cassandra sat, looking down at her cousinÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nface, which still moved with the speed of what she had been saying.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you--happy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, my dear!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra exclaimed, as if no further words were\\r\\nneeded. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course, we disagree about every subject under the sun,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nexclaimed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I think heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the cleverest man IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve ever met--and youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re\\r\\nthe most beautiful woman,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, looking at Katharine, and as\\r\\nshe looked her face lost its animation and became almost melancholy in\\r\\nsympathy with KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s melancholy, which seemed to Cassandra the last\\r\\nrefinement of her distinction.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, but itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s only ten oÃ¢\\x80\\x99clock,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine darkly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs late as that! Well--?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She did not understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt twelve my horses turn into rats and off I go. The illusion fades.\\r\\nBut I accept my fate. I make hay while the sun shines.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra looked\\r\\nat her with a puzzled expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Katharine talking about rats, and hay, and all sorts of odd\\r\\nthings,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, as William returned to them. He had been quick. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCan\\r\\nyou make her out?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine perceived from his little frown and hesitation that he did not\\r\\nfind that particular problem to his taste at present. She stood upright\\r\\nat once and said in a different tone:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI really am off, though. I wish youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d explain if they say anything,\\r\\nWilliam. I shanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be late, but IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve got to see some one.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt this time of night?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhom have you got to see?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA friend,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she remarked, half turning her head towards him. She\\r\\nknew that he wished her to stay, not, indeed, with them, but in their\\r\\nneighborhood, in case of need.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine has a great many friends,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said William rather lamely,\\r\\nsitting down once more, as Katharine left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was soon driving quickly, as she had wished to drive, through the\\r\\nlamp-lit streets. She liked both light and speed, and the sense of being\\r\\nout of doors alone, and the knowledge that she would reach Mary in her\\r\\nhigh, lonely room at the end of the drive. She climbed the stone steps\\r\\nquickly, remarking the queer look of her blue silk skirt and blue shoes\\r\\nupon the stone, dusty with the boots of the day, under the light of an\\r\\noccasional jet of flickering gas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door was opened in a second by Mary herself, whose face showed\\r\\nnot only surprise at the sight of her visitor, but some degree of\\r\\nembarrassment. She greeted her cordially, and, as there was no time for\\r\\nexplanations, Katharine walked straight into the sitting-room, and found\\r\\nherself in the presence of a young man who was lying back in a chair and\\r\\nholding a sheet of paper in his hand, at which he was looking as if he\\r\\nexpected to go on immediately with what he was in the middle of saying\\r\\nto Mary Datchet. The apparition of an unknown lady in full evening dress\\r\\nseemed to disturb him. He took his pipe from his mouth, rose stiffly,\\r\\nand sat down again with a jerk.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you been dining out?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you working?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine inquired simultaneously.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man shook his head, as if he disowned his share in the\\r\\nquestion with some irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, not exactly,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Basnett had brought some papers\\r\\nto show me. We were going through them, but weÃ¢\\x80\\x99d almost done.... Tell us\\r\\nabout your party.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had a ruffled appearance, as if she had been running her fingers\\r\\nthrough her hair in the course of her conversation; she was dressed more\\r\\nor less like a Russian peasant girl. She sat down again in a chair which\\r\\nlooked as if it had been her seat for some hours; the saucer which stood\\r\\nupon the arm contained the ashes of many cigarettes. Mr. Basnett, a very\\r\\nyoung man with a fresh complexion and a high forehead from which the\\r\\nhair was combed straight back, was one of that group of Ã¢\\x80\\x9cvery able young\\r\\nmenÃ¢\\x80\\x9d suspected by Mr. Clacton, justly as it turned out, of an influence\\r\\nupon Mary Datchet. He had come down from one of the Universities not\\r\\nlong ago, and was now charged with the reformation of society. In\\r\\nconnection with the rest of the group of very able young men he had\\r\\ndrawn up a scheme for the education of labor, for the amalgamation of\\r\\nthe middle class and the working class, and for a joint assault of the\\r\\ntwo bodies, combined in the Society for the Education of Democracy,\\r\\nupon Capital. The scheme had already reached the stage in which it was\\r\\npermissible to hire an office and engage a secretary, and he had been\\r\\ndeputed to expound the scheme to Mary, and make her an offer of the\\r\\nSecretaryship, to which, as a matter of principle, a small salary was\\r\\nattached. Since seven oÃ¢\\x80\\x99clock that evening he had been reading out loud\\r\\nthe document in which the faith of the new reformers was expounded, but\\r\\nthe reading was so frequently interrupted by discussion, and it was so\\r\\noften necessary to inform Mary Ã¢\\x80\\x9cin strictest confidenceÃ¢\\x80\\x9d of the private\\r\\ncharacters and evil designs of certain individuals and societies that\\r\\nthey were still only half-way through the manuscript. Neither of\\r\\nthem realized that the talk had already lasted three hours. In their\\r\\nabsorption they had forgotten even to feed the fire, and yet both Mr.\\r\\nBasnett in his exposition, and Mary in her interrogation, carefully\\r\\npreserved a kind of formality calculated to check the desire of the\\r\\nhuman mind for irrelevant discussion. Her questions frequently began,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAm I to understand--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and his replies invariably represented the views\\r\\nof some one called Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time Mary was almost persuaded that she, too, was included in\\r\\nthe Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and agreed with Mr. Basnett in believing that Ã¢\\x80\\x9courÃ¢\\x80\\x9d views,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9courÃ¢\\x80\\x9d society, Ã¢\\x80\\x9courÃ¢\\x80\\x9d policy, stood for something quite definitely\\r\\nsegregated from the main body of society in a circle of superior\\r\\nillumination.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe appearance of Katharine in this atmosphere was extremely\\r\\nincongruous, and had the effect of making Mary remember all sorts of\\r\\nthings that she had been glad to forget.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been dining out?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked again, looking, with a little smile,\\r\\nat the blue silk and the pearl-sewn shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, at home. Are you starting something new?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine hazarded,\\r\\nrather hesitatingly, looking at the papers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe are,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Basnett replied. He said no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m thinking of leaving our friends in Russell Square,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary explained.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI see. And then you will do something else.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid I like working,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAfraid,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Basnett, conveying the impression that, in his\\r\\nopinion, no sensible person could be afraid of liking to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, as if he had stated this opinion aloud. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should\\r\\nlike to start something--something off oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s own bat--thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what I\\r\\nshould like.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the fun,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Basnett, looking at her for the first\\r\\ntime rather keenly, and refilling his pipe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut you canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t limit work--thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what I mean,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI mean there\\r\\nare other sorts of work. No one works harder than a woman with little\\r\\nchildren.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cQuite so,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Basnett. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s precisely the women with babies\\r\\nwe want to get hold of.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He glanced at his document, rolled it into a\\r\\ncylinder between his fingers, and gazed into the fire. Katharine felt\\r\\nthat in this company anything that one said would be judged upon its\\r\\nmerits; one had only to say what one thought, rather barely and tersely,\\r\\nwith a curious assumption that the number of things that could properly\\r\\nbe thought about was strictly limited. And Mr. Basnett was only stiff\\r\\nupon the surface; there was an intelligence in his face which attracted\\r\\nher intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen will the public know?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat dÃ¢\\x80\\x99you mean--about us?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Basnett asked, with a little smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat depends upon many things,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary. The conspirators looked\\r\\npleased, as if KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s question, with the belief in their existence\\r\\nwhich it implied, had a warming effect upon them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn starting a society such as we wish to start (we canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t say any more\\r\\nat present),Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Basnett began, with a little jerk of his head, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthere\\r\\nare two things to remember--the Press and the public. Other societies,\\r\\nwhich shall be nameless, have gone under because theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve appealed only\\r\\nto cranks. If you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want a mutual admiration society, which dies as\\r\\nsoon as youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve all discovered each otherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s faults, you must nobble the\\r\\nPress. You must appeal to the public.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the difficulty,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s where she comes in,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Basnett, jerking his head in\\r\\nMaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s direction. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the only one of us whoÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a capitalist. She can\\r\\nmake a whole-time job of it. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m tied to an office; I can only give my\\r\\nspare time. Are you, by any chance, on the look-out for a job?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked\\r\\nKatharine, with a queer mixture of distrust and deference.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMarriage is her job at present,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary replied for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, I see,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Basnett. He made allowances for that; he and\\r\\nhis friends had faced the question of sex, along with all others, and\\r\\nassigned it an honorable place in their scheme of life. Katharine felt\\r\\nthis beneath the roughness of his manner; and a world entrusted to the\\r\\nguardianship of Mary Datchet and Mr. Basnett seemed to her a good world,\\r\\nalthough not a romantic or beautiful place or, to put it figuratively,\\r\\na place where any line of blue mist softly linked tree to tree upon the\\r\\nhorizon. For a moment she thought she saw in his face, bent now over the\\r\\nfire, the features of that original man whom we still recall every\\r\\nnow and then, although we know only the clerk, barrister, Governmental\\r\\nofficial, or workingman variety of him. Not that Mr. Basnett, giving his\\r\\ndays to commerce and his spare time to social reform, would long carry\\r\\nabout him any trace of his possibilities of completeness; but, for the\\r\\nmoment, in his youth and ardor, still speculative, still uncramped, one\\r\\nmight imagine him the citizen of a nobler state than ours. Katharine\\r\\nturned over her small stock of information, and wondered what their\\r\\nsociety might be going to attempt. Then she remembered that she was\\r\\nhindering their business, and rose, still thinking of this society, and\\r\\nthus thinking, she said to Mr. Basnett:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll ask me to join when the time comes, I hope.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded, and took his pipe from his mouth, but, being unable to think\\r\\nof anything to say, he put it back again, although he would have been\\r\\nglad if she had stayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgainst her wish, Mary insisted upon taking her downstairs, and then, as\\r\\nthere was no cab to be seen, they stood in the street together, looking\\r\\nabout them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGo back,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine urged her, thinking of Mr. Basnett with his papers\\r\\nin his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t wander about the streets alone in those clothes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary,\\r\\nbut the desire to find a cab was not her true reason for standing beside\\r\\nKatharine for a minute or two. Unfortunately for her composure, Mr.\\r\\nBasnett and his papers seemed to her an incidental diversion of lifeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nserious purpose compared with some tremendous fact which manifested\\r\\nitself as she stood alone with Katharine. It may have been their common\\r\\nwomanhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you seen Ralph?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked suddenly, without preface.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine directly, but she did not remember when or where\\r\\nshe had seen him. It took her a moment or two to remember why Mary\\r\\nshould ask her if she had seen Ralph.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI believe IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m jealous,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNonsense, Mary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, rather distractedly, taking her arm\\r\\nand beginning to walk up the street in the direction of the main road.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLet me see; we went to Kew, and we agreed to be friends. Yes, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwhat happened.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary was silent, in the hope that Katharine would tell\\r\\nher more. But Katharine said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not a question of friendship,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary exclaimed, her anger rising,\\r\\nto her own surprise. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou know itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not. How can it be? IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve no right\\r\\nto interfere--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She stopped. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOnly IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d rather Ralph wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t hurt,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nconcluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think he seems able to take care of himself,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine observed.\\r\\nWithout either of them wishing it, a feeling of hostility had risen\\r\\nbetween them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you really think itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s worth it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, after a pause.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow can one tell?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you ever cared for any one?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary demanded rashly and foolishly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t wander about London discussing my feelings--HereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a cab--no,\\r\\nthereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s some one in it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to quarrel,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOught I to have told him that I wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be his friend?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine\\r\\nasked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShall I tell him that? If so, what reason shall I give him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf course you canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t tell him that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, controlling herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI believe I shall, though,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI lost my temper, Katharine; I shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have said what I did.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe whole thingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s foolish,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, peremptorily. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what\\r\\nI say. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not worth it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She spoke with unnecessary vehemence, but it\\r\\nwas not directed against Mary Datchet. Their animosity had completely\\r\\ndisappeared, and upon both of them a cloud of difficulty and darkness\\r\\nrested, obscuring the future, in which they had both to find a way.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not worth it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine repeated. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSuppose, as you say,\\r\\nitÃ¢\\x80\\x99s out of the question--this friendship; he falls in love with me. I\\r\\ndonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want that. Still,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI believe you exaggerate; loveÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nnot everything; marriage itself is only one of the things--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d They had\\r\\nreached the main thoroughfare, and stood looking at the omnibuses and\\r\\npassers-by, who seemed, for the moment, to illustrate what Katharine had\\r\\nsaid of the diversity of human interests. For both of them it had become\\r\\none of those moments of extreme detachment, when it seems unnecessary\\r\\never again to shoulder the burden of happiness and self-assertive\\r\\nexistence. Their neighbors were welcome to their possessions.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t lay down any rules,Ã¢\\x80\\x9dÃ¢\\x80\\x99 said Mary, recovering herself first, as\\r\\nthey turned after a long pause of this description. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAll I say is that\\r\\nyou should know what youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re about--for certain; but,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nexpect you do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time she was profoundly perplexed, not only by what she\\r\\nknew of the arrangements for KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s marriage, but by the impression\\r\\nwhich she had of her, there on her arm, dark and inscrutable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked back again and reached the steps which led up to MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nflat. Here they stopped and paused for a moment, saying nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou must go in,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, rousing herself. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s waiting all\\r\\nthis time to go on with his reading.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She glanced up at the lighted\\r\\nwindow near the top of the house, and they both looked at it and waited\\r\\nfor a moment. A flight of semicircular steps ran up to the hall, and\\r\\nMary slowly mounted the first two or three, and paused, looking down\\r\\nupon Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think you underrate the value of that emotion,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said slowly, and\\r\\na little awkwardly. She climbed another step and looked down once more\\r\\nupon the figure that was only partly lit up, standing in the street with\\r\\na colorless face turned upwards. As Mary hesitated, a cab came by and\\r\\nKatharine turned and stopped it, saying as she opened the door:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRemember, I want to belong to your society--remember,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added,\\r\\nhaving to raise her voice a little, and shutting the door upon the rest\\r\\nof her words.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary mounted the stairs step by step, as if she had to lift her body up\\r\\nan extremely steep ascent. She had had to wrench herself forcibly\\r\\naway from Katharine, and every step vanquished her desire. She held\\r\\non grimly, encouraging herself as though she were actually making some\\r\\ngreat physical effort in climbing a height. She was conscious that Mr.\\r\\nBasnett, sitting at the top of the stairs with his documents, offered\\r\\nher solid footing if she were capable of reaching it. The knowledge gave\\r\\nher a faint sense of exaltation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Basnett raised his eyes as she opened the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll go on where I left off,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cStop me if you want anything\\r\\nexplained.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been re-reading the document, and making pencil notes in the\\r\\nmargin while he waited, and he went on again as if there had been\\r\\nno interruption. Mary sat down among the flat cushions, lit another\\r\\ncigarette, and listened with a frown upon her face.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine leant back in the corner of the cab that carried her to\\r\\nChelsea, conscious of fatigue, and conscious, too, of the sober and\\r\\nsatisfactory nature of such industry as she had just witnessed. The\\r\\nthought of it composed and calmed her. When she reached home she let\\r\\nherself in as quietly as she could, in the hope that the household was\\r\\nalready gone to bed. But her excursion had occupied less time than she\\r\\nthought, and she heard sounds of unmistakable liveliness upstairs. A\\r\\ndoor opened, and she drew herself into a ground-floor room in case the\\r\\nsound meant that Mr. Peyton were taking his leave. From where she stood\\r\\nshe could see the stairs, though she was herself invisible. Some one was\\r\\ncoming down the stairs, and now she saw that it was William Rodney. He\\r\\nlooked a little strange, as if he were walking in his sleep; his lips\\r\\nmoved as if he were acting some part to himself. He came down very\\r\\nslowly, step by step, with one hand upon the banisters to guide himself.\\r\\nShe thought he looked as if he were in some mood of high exaltation,\\r\\nwhich it made her uncomfortable to witness any longer unseen. She\\r\\nstepped into the hall. He gave a great start upon seeing her and\\r\\nstopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been out?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes.... Are they still up?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe did not answer, and walked into the ground-floor room through the\\r\\ndoor which stood open.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s been more wonderful than I can tell you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m incredibly\\r\\nhappy--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was scarcely addressing her, and she said nothing. For a moment they\\r\\nstood at opposite sides of a table saying nothing. Then he asked her\\r\\nquickly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut tell me, how did it seem to you? What did you think,\\r\\nKatharine? Is there a chance that she likes me? Tell me, Katharine!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore she could answer a door opened on the landing above and disturbed\\r\\nthem. It disturbed William excessively. He started back, walked rapidly\\r\\ninto the hall, and said in a loud and ostentatiously ordinary tone:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood night, Katharine. Go to bed now. I shall see you soon. I hope I\\r\\nshall be able to come to-morrow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNext moment he was gone. She went upstairs and found Cassandra on the\\r\\nlanding. She held two or three books in her hand, and she was stooping\\r\\nto look at others in a little bookcase. She said that she could never\\r\\ntell which book she wanted to read in bed, poetry, biography, or\\r\\nmetaphysics.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you read in bed, Katharine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked, as they walked upstairs\\r\\nside by side.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSometimes one thing--sometimes another,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine vaguely.\\r\\nCassandra looked at her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDÃ¢\\x80\\x99you know, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re extraordinarily queer,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cEvery one seems\\r\\nto me a little queer. Perhaps itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the effect of London.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs William queer, too?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, I think he is a little,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cQueer, but very\\r\\nfascinating. I shall read Milton to-night. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s been one of the happiest\\r\\nnights of my life, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, looking with shy devotion at\\r\\nher cousinÃ¢\\x80\\x99s beautiful face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon, in the first days of spring, has buds that open and flowers that\\r\\nsuddenly shake their petals--white, purple, or crimson--in competition\\r\\nwith the display in the garden beds, although these city flowers are\\r\\nmerely so many doors flung wide in Bond Street and the neighborhood,\\r\\ninviting you to look at a picture, or hear a symphony, or merely crowd\\r\\nand crush yourself among all sorts of vocal, excitable, brightly colored\\r\\nhuman beings. But, all the same, it is no mean rival to the quieter\\r\\nprocess of vegetable florescence. Whether or not there is a generous\\r\\nmotive at the root, a desire to share and impart, or whether the\\r\\nanimation is purely that of insensate fervor and friction, the effect,\\r\\nwhile it lasts, certainly encourages those who are young, and those\\r\\nwho are ignorant, to think the world one great bazaar, with banners\\r\\nfluttering and divans heaped with spoils from every quarter of the globe\\r\\nfor their delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Cassandra Otway went about London provided with shillings that\\r\\nopened turnstiles, or more often with large white cards that disregarded\\r\\nturnstiles, the city seemed to her the most lavish and hospitable\\r\\nof hosts. After visiting the National Gallery, or Hertford House, or\\r\\nhearing Brahms or Beethoven at the Bechstein Hall, she would come back\\r\\nto find a new person awaiting her, in whose soul were imbedded some\\r\\ngrains of the invaluable substance which she still called reality, and\\r\\nstill believed that she could find. The Hilberys, as the saying is,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cknew every one,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and that arrogant claim was certainly upheld by the\\r\\nnumber of houses which, within a certain area, lit their lamps at night,\\r\\nopened their doors after 3 p. m., and admitted the Hilberys to their\\r\\ndining-rooms, say, once a month. An indefinable freedom and authority of\\r\\nmanner, shared by most of the people who lived in these houses, seemed\\r\\nto indicate that whether it was a question of art, music, or government,\\r\\nthey were well within the gates, and could smile indulgently at the\\r\\nvast mass of humanity which is forced to wait and struggle, and pay for\\r\\nentrance with common coin at the door. The gates opened instantly to\\r\\nadmit Cassandra. She was naturally critical of what went on inside, and\\r\\ninclined to quote what Henry would have said; but she often succeeded in\\r\\ncontradicting Henry, in his absence, and invariably paid her partner\\r\\nat dinner, or the kind old lady who remembered her grandmother, the\\r\\ncompliment of believing that there was meaning in what they said. For\\r\\nthe sake of the light in her eager eyes, much crudity of expression and\\r\\nsome untidiness of person were forgiven her. It was generally felt that,\\r\\ngiven a year or two of experience, introduced to good dressmakers,\\r\\nand preserved from bad influences, she would be an acquisition. Those\\r\\nelderly ladies, who sit on the edge of ballrooms sampling the stuff\\r\\nof humanity between finger and thumb and breathing so evenly that the\\r\\nnecklaces, which rise and fall upon their breasts, seem to represent\\r\\nsome elemental force, such as the waves upon the ocean of humanity,\\r\\nconcluded, a little smilingly, that she would do. They meant that\\r\\nshe would in all probability marry some young man whose mother they\\r\\nrespected.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Rodney was fertile in suggestions. He knew of little galleries,\\r\\nand select concerts, and private performances, and somehow made time to\\r\\nmeet Katharine and Cassandra, and to give them tea or dinner or supper\\r\\nin his rooms afterwards. Each one of her fourteen days thus promised to\\r\\nbear some bright illumination in its sober text. But Sunday approached.\\r\\nThe day is usually dedicated to Nature. The weather was almost kindly\\r\\nenough for an expedition. But Cassandra rejected Hampton Court,\\r\\nGreenwich, Richmond, and Kew in favor of the Zoological Gardens. She had\\r\\nonce trifled with the psychology of animals, and still knew something\\r\\nabout inherited characteristics. On Sunday afternoon, therefore,\\r\\nKatharine, Cassandra, and William Rodney drove off to the Zoo. As their\\r\\ncab approached the entrance, Katharine bent forward and waved her hand\\r\\nto a young man who was walking rapidly in the same direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Ralph Denham!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI told him to meet us here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she added. She had even come provided with a ticket for him. WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nobjection that he would not be admitted was, therefore, silenced\\r\\ndirectly. But the way in which the two men greeted each other was\\r\\nsignificant of what was going to happen. As soon as they had admired the\\r\\nlittle birds in the large cage William and Cassandra lagged behind, and\\r\\nRalph and Katharine pressed on rather in advance. It was an arrangement\\r\\nin which William took his part, and one that suited his convenience, but\\r\\nhe was annoyed all the same. He thought that Katharine should have told\\r\\nhim that she had invited Denham to meet them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOne of KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s friends,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said rather sharply. It was clear\\r\\nthat he was irritated, and Cassandra felt for his annoyance. They were\\r\\nstanding by the pen of some Oriental hog, and she was prodding the\\r\\nbrute gently with the point of her umbrella, when a thousand little\\r\\nobservations seemed, in some way, to collect in one center. The center\\r\\nwas one of intense and curious emotion. Were they happy? She dismissed\\r\\nthe question as she asked it, scorning herself for applying such simple\\r\\nmeasures to the rare and splendid emotions of so unique a couple.\\r\\nNevertheless, her manner became immediately different, as if, for\\r\\nthe first time, she felt consciously womanly, and as if William might\\r\\nconceivably wish later on to confide in her. She forgot all about the\\r\\npsychology of animals, and the recurrence of blue eyes and brown,\\r\\nand became instantly engrossed in her feelings as a woman who could\\r\\nadminister consolation, and she hoped that Katharine would keep ahead\\r\\nwith Mr. Denham, as a child who plays at being grown-up hopes that her\\r\\nmother wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t come in just yet, and spoil the game. Or was it not rather\\r\\nthat she had ceased to play at being grown-up, and was conscious,\\r\\nsuddenly, that she was alarmingly mature and in earnest?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was still unbroken silence between Katharine and Ralph Denham, but\\r\\nthe occupants of the different cages served instead of speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat have you been doing since we met?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph asked at length.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDoing?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she pondered. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWalking in and out of other peopleÃ¢\\x80\\x99s houses. I\\r\\nwonder if these animals are happy?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she speculated, stopping before a\\r\\ngray bear, who was philosophically playing with a tassel which once,\\r\\nperhaps, formed part of a ladyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s parasol.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid Rodney didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like my coming,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. But heÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll soon get over that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied. The detachment\\r\\nexpressed by her voice puzzled Ralph, and he would have been glad if she\\r\\nhad explained her meaning further. But he was not going to press her\\r\\nfor explanations. Each moment was to be, as far as he could make it,\\r\\ncomplete in itself, owing nothing of its happiness to explanations,\\r\\nborrowing neither bright nor dark tints from the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe bears seem happy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he remarked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut we must buy them a bag of\\r\\nsomething. ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the place to buy buns. LetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s go and get them.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n They walked to the counter piled with little paper bags, and each\\r\\nsimultaneously produced a shilling and pressed it upon the young lady,\\r\\nwho did not know whether to oblige the lady or the gentleman, but\\r\\ndecided, from conventional reasons, that it was the part of the\\r\\ngentleman to pay.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wish to pay,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph peremptorily, refusing the coin which\\r\\nKatharine tendered. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have a reason for what I do,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, seeing\\r\\nher smile at his tone of decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI believe you have a reason for everything,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she agreed, breaking the\\r\\nbun into parts and tossing them down the bearsÃ¢\\x80\\x99 throats, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nbelieve itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a good one this time. What is your reason?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe refused to tell her. He could not explain to her that he was offering\\r\\nup consciously all his happiness to her, and wished, absurdly enough, to\\r\\npour every possession he had upon the blazing pyre, even his silver and\\r\\ngold. He wished to keep this distance between them--the distance which\\r\\nseparates the devotee from the image in the shrine.\\r\\n\\r\\nCircumstances conspired to make this easier than it would have been, had\\r\\nthey been seated in a drawing-room, for example, with a tea-tray between\\r\\nthem. He saw her against a background of pale grottos and sleek hides;\\r\\ncamels slanted their heavy-ridded eyes at her, giraffes fastidiously\\r\\nobserved her from their melancholy eminence, and the pink-lined trunks\\r\\nof elephants cautiously abstracted buns from her outstretched hands.\\r\\nThen there were the hothouses. He saw her bending over pythons coiled\\r\\nupon the sand, or considering the brown rock breaking the stagnant water\\r\\nof the alligatorsÃ¢\\x80\\x99 pool, or searching some minute section of tropical\\r\\nforest for the golden eye of a lizard or the indrawn movement of the\\r\\ngreen frogsÃ¢\\x80\\x99 flanks. In particular, he saw her outlined against the deep\\r\\ngreen waters, in which squadrons of silvery fish wheeled incessantly,\\r\\nor ogled her for a moment, pressing their distorted mouths against the\\r\\nglass, quivering their tails straight out behind them. Again, there was\\r\\nthe insect house, where she lifted the blinds of the little cages, and\\r\\nmarveled at the purple circles marked upon the rich tussore wings of\\r\\nsome lately emerged and semi-conscious butterfly, or at caterpillars\\r\\nimmobile like the knobbed twigs of a pale-skinned tree, or at slim green\\r\\nsnakes stabbing the glass wall again and again with their flickering\\r\\ncleft tongues. The heat of the air, and the bloom of heavy flowers,\\r\\nwhich swam in water or rose stiffly from great red jars, together\\r\\nwith the display of curious patterns and fantastic shapes, produced an\\r\\natmosphere in which human beings tended to look pale and to fall silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpening the door of a house which rang with the mocking and profoundly\\r\\nunhappy laughter of monkeys, they discovered William and Cassandra.\\r\\nWilliam appeared to be tempting some small reluctant animal to descend\\r\\nfrom an upper perch to partake of half an apple. Cassandra was reading\\r\\nout, in her high-pitched tones, an account of this creatureÃ¢\\x80\\x99s secluded\\r\\ndisposition and nocturnal habits. She saw Katharine and exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHere you are! Do prevent William from torturing this unfortunate\\r\\naye-aye.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe thought weÃ¢\\x80\\x99d lost you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said William. He looked from one to the\\r\\nother, and seemed to take stock of DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s unfashionable appearance. He\\r\\nseemed to wish to find some outlet for malevolence, but, failing one,\\r\\nhe remained silent. The glance, the slight quiver of the upper lip, were\\r\\nnot lost upon Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWilliam isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t kind to animals,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she remarked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know what\\r\\nthey like and what they donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t like.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI take it youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re well versed in these matters, Denham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Rodney,\\r\\nwithdrawing his hand with the apple.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mainly a question of knowing how to stroke them,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhich is the way to the Reptile House?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra asked him, not from\\r\\na genuine desire to visit the reptiles, but in obedience to her new-born\\r\\nfeminine susceptibility, which urged her to charm and conciliate the\\r\\nother sex. Denham began to give her directions, and Katharine and\\r\\nWilliam moved on together.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI hope youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve had a pleasant afternoon,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI like Ralph Denham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCa se voit,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William returned, with superficial urbanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany retorts were obvious, but wishing, on the whole, for peace,\\r\\nKatharine merely inquired:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you coming back to tea?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCassandra and I thought of having tea at a little shop in Portland\\r\\nPlace,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know whether you and Denham would care to\\r\\njoin us.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll ask him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied, turning her head to look for him. But he\\r\\nand Cassandra were absorbed in the aye-aye once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam and Katharine watched them for a moment, and each looked\\r\\ncuriously at the object of the otherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s preference. But resting his eye\\r\\nupon Cassandra, to whose elegance the dressmakers had now done justice,\\r\\nWilliam said sharply:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf you come, I hope you wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t do your best to make me ridiculous.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re afraid of I certainly shanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t come,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine\\r\\nreplied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were professedly looking into the enormous central cage of monkeys,\\r\\nand being thoroughly annoyed by William, she compared him to a wretched\\r\\nmisanthropical ape, huddled in a scrap of old shawl at the end of\\r\\na pole, darting peevish glances of suspicion and distrust at his\\r\\ncompanions. Her tolerance was deserting her. The events of the past week\\r\\nhad worn it thin. She was in one of those moods, perhaps not uncommon\\r\\nwith either sex, when the other becomes very clearly distinguished,\\r\\nand of contemptible baseness, so that the necessity of association is\\r\\ndegrading, and the tie, which at such moments is always extremely close,\\r\\ndrags like a halter round the neck. WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s exacting demands and his\\r\\njealousy had pulled her down into some horrible swamp of her nature\\r\\nwhere the primeval struggle between man and woman still rages.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou seem to delight in hurting me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William persisted. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy did you say\\r\\nthat just now about my behavior to animals?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d As he spoke he rattled\\r\\nhis stick against the bars of the cage, which gave his words an\\r\\naccompaniment peculiarly exasperating to KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s nerves.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s true. You never see what any one feels,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\nthink of no one but yourself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat is not true,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said William. By his determined rattling he had\\r\\nnow collected the animated attention of some half-dozen apes. Either\\r\\nto propitiate them, or to show his consideration for their feelings, he\\r\\nproceeded to offer them the apple which he held.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sight, unfortunately, was so comically apt in its illustration of\\r\\nthe picture in her mind, the ruse was so transparent, that Katharine was\\r\\nseized with laughter. She laughed uncontrollably. William flushed red.\\r\\nNo display of anger could have hurt his feelings more profoundly. It was\\r\\nnot only that she was laughing at him; the detachment of the sound was\\r\\nhorrible.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know what youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re laughing at,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he muttered, and, turning,\\r\\nfound that the other couple had rejoined them. As if the matter had been\\r\\nprivately agreed upon, the couples separated once more, Katharine and\\r\\nDenham passing out of the house without more than a perfunctory glance\\r\\nround them. Denham obeyed what seemed to be KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s wish in thus\\r\\nmaking haste. Some change had come over her. He connected it with her\\r\\nlaughter, and her few words in private with Rodney; he felt that she had\\r\\nbecome unfriendly to him. She talked, but her remarks were indifferent,\\r\\nand when he spoke her attention seemed to wander. This change of\\r\\nmood was at first extremely disagreeable to him; but soon he found it\\r\\nsalutary. The pale drizzling atmosphere of the day affected him, also.\\r\\nThe charm, the insidious magic in which he had luxuriated, were suddenly\\r\\ngone; his feeling had become one of friendly respect, and to his great\\r\\npleasure he found himself thinking spontaneously of the relief of\\r\\nfinding himself alone in his room that night. In his surprise at the\\r\\nsuddenness of the change, and at the extent of his freedom, he bethought\\r\\nhim of a daring plan, by which the ghost of Katharine could be more\\r\\neffectually exorcised than by mere abstinence. He would ask her to come\\r\\nhome with him to tea. He would force her through the mill of family\\r\\nlife; he would place her in a light unsparing and revealing. His family\\r\\nwould find nothing to admire in her, and she, he felt certain, would\\r\\ndespise them all, and this, too, would help him. He felt himself\\r\\nbecoming more and more merciless towards her. By such courageous\\r\\nmeasures any one, he thought, could end the absurd passions which were\\r\\nthe cause of so much pain and waste. He could foresee a time when his\\r\\nexperiences, his discovery, and his triumph were made available for\\r\\nyounger brothers who found themselves in the same predicament. He looked\\r\\nat his watch, and remarked that the gardens would soon be closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnyhow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve seen enough for one afternoon. Where\\r\\nhave the others got to?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He looked over his shoulder, and, seeing no\\r\\ntrace of them, remarked at once:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWeÃ¢\\x80\\x99d better be independent of them. The best plan will be for you to\\r\\ncome back to tea with me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you come with me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re next door to Highgate here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied promptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe assented, having very little notion whether Highgate was next door\\r\\nto RegentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Park or not. She was only glad to put off her return to\\r\\nthe family tea-table in Chelsea for an hour or two. They proceeded with\\r\\ndogged determination through the winding roads of RegentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Park, and\\r\\nthe Sunday-stricken streets of the neighborhood, in the direction of the\\r\\nTube station. Ignorant of the way, she resigned herself entirely to him,\\r\\nand found his silence a convenient cover beneath which to continue her\\r\\nanger with Rodney.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they stepped out of the train into the still grayer gloom of\\r\\nHighgate, she wondered, for the first time, where he was taking her.\\r\\nHad he a family, or did he live alone in rooms? On the whole she was\\r\\ninclined to believe that he was the only son of an aged, and possibly\\r\\ninvalid, mother. She sketched lightly, upon the blank vista down which\\r\\nthey walked, the little white house and the tremulous old lady rising\\r\\nfrom behind her tea-table to greet her with faltering words about Ã¢\\x80\\x9cmy\\r\\nsonÃ¢\\x80\\x99s friends,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and was on the point of asking Ralph to tell her what\\r\\nshe might expect, when he jerked open one of the infinite number of\\r\\nidentical wooden doors, and led her up a tiled path to a porch in the\\r\\nAlpine style of architecture. As they listened to the shaking of the\\r\\nbell in the basement, she could summon no vision to replace the one so\\r\\nrudely destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI must warn you to expect a family party,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re mostly\\r\\nin on Sundays. We can go to my room afterwards.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you many brothers and sisters?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked, without concealing her\\r\\ndismay.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSix or seven,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied grimly, as the door opened.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Ralph took off his coat, she had time to notice the ferns and\\r\\nphotographs and draperies, and to hear a hum, or rather a babble, of\\r\\nvoices talking each other down, from the sound of them. The rigidity\\r\\nof extreme shyness came over her. She kept as far behind Denham as she\\r\\ncould, and walked stiffly after him into a room blazing with unshaded\\r\\nlights, which fell upon a number of people, of different ages,\\r\\nsitting round a large dining-room table untidily strewn with food, and\\r\\nunflinchingly lit up by incandescent gas. Ralph walked straight to the\\r\\nfar end of the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMother, this is Miss Hilbery,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large elderly lady, bent over an unsatisfactory spirit-lamp, looked up\\r\\nwith a little frown, and observed:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon. I thought you were one of my own girls. Dorothy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she continued on the same breath, to catch the servant before she left\\r\\nthe room, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe shall want some more methylated spirits--unless the lamp\\r\\nitself is out of order. If one of you could invent a good spirit-lamp--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she sighed, looking generally down the table, and then began seeking\\r\\namong the china before her for two clean cups for the new-comers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unsparing light revealed more ugliness than Katharine had seen in\\r\\none room for a very long time. It was the ugliness of enormous folds\\r\\nof brown material, looped and festooned, of plush curtains, from which\\r\\ndepended balls and fringes, partially concealing bookshelves swollen\\r\\nwith black school-texts. Her eye was arrested by crossed scabbards of\\r\\nfretted wood upon the dull green wall, and whereever there was a high\\r\\nflat eminence, some fern waved from a pot of crinkled china, or a\\r\\nbronze horse reared so high that the stump of a tree had to sustain his\\r\\nforequarters. The waters of family life seemed to rise and close over\\r\\nher head, and she munched in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length Mrs. Denham looked up from her teacups and remarked:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou see, Miss Hilbery, my children all come in at different hours and\\r\\nwant different things. (The tray should go up if youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve done,\\r\\nJohnnie.) My boy Charles is in bed with a cold. What else can you\\r\\nexpect?--standing in the wet playing football. We did try drawing-room\\r\\ntea, but it didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA boy of sixteen, who appeared to be Johnnie, grumbled derisively both\\r\\nat the notion of drawing-room tea and at the necessity of carrying a\\r\\ntray up to his brother. But he took himself off, being enjoined by his\\r\\nmother to mind what he was doing, and shut the door after him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s much nicer like this,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, applying herself with\\r\\ndetermination to the dissection of her cake; they had given her too\\r\\nlarge a slice. She knew that Mrs. Denham suspected her of critical\\r\\ncomparisons. She knew that she was making poor progress with her cake.\\r\\nMrs. Denham had looked at her sufficiently often to make it clear to\\r\\nKatharine that she was asking who this young woman was, and why Ralph\\r\\nhad brought her to tea with them. There was an obvious reason, which\\r\\nMrs. Denham had probably reached by this time. Outwardly, she was\\r\\nbehaving with rather rusty and laborious civility. She was making\\r\\nconversation about the amenities of Highgate, its development and\\r\\nsituation.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen I first married,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHighgate was quite separate from\\r\\nLondon, Miss Hilbery, and this house, though you wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe it,\\r\\nhad a view of apple orchards. That was before the Middletons built their\\r\\nhouse in front of us.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt must be a great advantage to live at the top of a hill,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nKatharine. Mrs. Denham agreed effusively, as if her opinion of\\r\\nKatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sense had risen.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed, we find it very healthy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, and she went on,\\r\\nas people who live in the suburbs so often do, to prove that it was\\r\\nhealthier, more convenient, and less spoilt than any suburb round\\r\\nLondon. She spoke with such emphasis that it was quite obvious that she\\r\\nexpressed unpopular views, and that her children disagreed with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe ceilingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s fallen down in the pantry again,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Hester, a girl of\\r\\neighteen, abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe whole house will be down one of these days,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d James muttered.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNonsense,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Denham. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s only a little bit of plaster--I\\r\\ndonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see how any house could be expected to stand the wear and tear\\r\\nyou give it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Here some family joke exploded, which Katharine could not\\r\\nfollow. Even Mrs. Denham laughed against her will.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMiss HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s thinking us all so rude,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added reprovingly. Miss\\r\\nHilbery smiled and shook her head, and was conscious that a great many\\r\\neyes rested upon her, for a moment, as if they would find pleasure\\r\\nin discussing her when she was gone. Owing, perhaps, to this critical\\r\\nglance, Katharine decided that Ralph DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s family was commonplace,\\r\\nunshapely, lacking in charm, and fitly expressed by the hideous nature\\r\\nof their furniture and decorations. She glanced along a mantelpiece\\r\\nranged with bronze chariots, silver vases, and china ornaments that were\\r\\neither facetious or eccentric.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not apply her judgment consciously to Ralph, but when she looked\\r\\nat him, a moment later, she rated him lower than at any other time of\\r\\ntheir acquaintanceship.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had made no effort to tide over the discomforts of her introduction,\\r\\nand now, engaged in argument with his brother, apparently forgot her\\r\\npresence. She must have counted upon his support more than she realized,\\r\\nfor this indifference, emphasized, as it was, by the insignificant\\r\\ncommonplace of his surroundings, awoke her, not only to that ugliness,\\r\\nbut to her own folly. She thought of one scene after another in a few\\r\\nseconds, with that shudder which is almost a blush. She had believed\\r\\nhim when he spoke of friendship. She had believed in a spiritual\\r\\nlight burning steadily and steadfastly behind the erratic disorder\\r\\nand incoherence of life. The light was now gone out, suddenly, as if\\r\\na sponge had blotted it. The litter of the table and the tedious but\\r\\nexacting conversation of Mrs. Denham remained: they struck, indeed, upon\\r\\na mind bereft of all defences, and, keenly conscious of the degradation\\r\\nwhich is the result of strife whether victorious or not, she thought\\r\\ngloomily of her loneliness, of lifeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s futility, of the barren prose of\\r\\nreality, of William Rodney, of her mother, and the unfinished book.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer answers to Mrs. Denham were perfunctory to the verge of rudeness,\\r\\nand to Ralph, who watched her narrowly, she seemed further away than was\\r\\ncompatible with her physical closeness. He glanced at her, and ground\\r\\nout further steps in his argument, determined that no folly should\\r\\nremain when this experience was over. Next moment, a silence, sudden and\\r\\ncomplete, descended upon them all. The silence of all these people round\\r\\nthe untidy table was enormous and hideous; something horrible seemed\\r\\nabout to burst from it, but they endured it obstinately. A second later\\r\\nthe door opened and there was a stir of relief; cries of Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHullo,\\r\\nJoan! ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s nothing left for you to eat,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d broke up the oppressive\\r\\nconcentration of so many eyes upon the table-cloth, and set the waters\\r\\nof family life dashing in brisk little waves again. It was obvious that\\r\\nJoan had some mysterious and beneficent power upon her family. She went\\r\\nup to Katharine as if she had heard of her, and was very glad to see her\\r\\nat last. She explained that she had been visiting an uncle who was ill,\\r\\nand that had kept her. No, she hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t had any tea, but a slice of bread\\r\\nwould do. Some one handed up a hot cake, which had been keeping warm in\\r\\nthe fender; she sat down by her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s side, Mrs. DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s anxieties\\r\\nseemed to relax, and every one began eating and drinking, as if tea had\\r\\nbegun over again. Hester voluntarily explained to Katharine that she was\\r\\nreading to pass some examination, because she wanted more than anything\\r\\nin the whole world to go to Newnham.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, just let me hear you decline Ã¢\\x80\\x98amoÃ¢\\x80\\x99--I love,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Johnnie demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, Johnnie, no Greek at meal-times,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Joan, overhearing him\\r\\ninstantly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s up at all hours of the night over her books, Miss\\r\\nHilbery, and IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not the way to pass examinations,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went\\r\\non, smiling at Katharine, with the worried humorous smile of the elder\\r\\nsister whose younger brothers and sisters have become almost like\\r\\nchildren of her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cJoan, you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t really think that Ã¢\\x80\\x98amoÃ¢\\x80\\x99 is Greek?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph\\r\\n\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid I say Greek? Well, never mind. No dead languages at tea-time. My\\r\\ndear boy, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t trouble to make me any toast--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOr if you do, surely thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the toasting-fork somewhere?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.\\r\\nDenham, still cherishing the belief that the bread-knife could be\\r\\nspoilt. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDo one of you ring and ask for one,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, without any\\r\\nconviction that she would be obeyed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut is Ann coming to be with Uncle\\r\\nJoseph?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf so, surely they had better send Amy to\\r\\nus--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and in the mysterious delight of learning further details of these\\r\\narrangements, and suggesting more sensible plans of her own, which, from\\r\\nthe aggrieved way in which she spoke, she did not seem to expect any one\\r\\nto adopt, Mrs. Denham completely forgot the presence of a well-dressed\\r\\nvisitor, who had to be informed about the amenities of Highgate. As soon\\r\\nas Joan had taken her seat, an argument had sprung up on either side of\\r\\nKatharine, as to whether the Salvation Army has any right to play hymns\\r\\nat street corners on Sunday mornings, thereby making it impossible for\\r\\nJames to have his sleep out, and tampering with the rights of individual\\r\\nliberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou see, James likes to lie in bed and sleep like a hog,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Johnnie,\\r\\nexplaining himself to Katharine, whereupon James fired up and, making\\r\\nher his goal, also exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause Sundays are my one chance in the week of having my sleep out.\\r\\nJohnnie messes with stinking chemicals in the pantry--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey appealed to her, and she forgot her cake and began to laugh and\\r\\ntalk and argue with sudden animation. The large family seemed to her\\r\\nso warm and various that she forgot to censure them for their taste in\\r\\npottery. But the personal question between James and Johnnie merged into\\r\\nsome argument already, apparently, debated, so that the parts had\\r\\nbeen distributed among the family, in which Ralph took the lead; and\\r\\nKatharine found herself opposed to him and the champion of JohnnieÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncause, who, it appeared, always lost his head and got excited in\\r\\nargument with Ralph.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what I mean. SheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s got it right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed, after\\r\\nKatharine had restated his case, and made it more precise. The debate\\r\\nwas left almost solely to Katharine and Ralph. They looked into each\\r\\notherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eyes fixedly, like wrestlers trying to see what movement is\\r\\ncoming next, and while Ralph spoke, Katharine bit her lower lip, and was\\r\\nalways ready with her next point as soon as he had done. They were very\\r\\nwell matched, and held the opposite views.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at the most exciting stage of the argument, for no reason that\\r\\nKatharine could see, all chairs were pushed back, and one after another\\r\\nthe Denham family got up and went out of the door, as if a bell had\\r\\nsummoned them. She was not used to the clockwork regulations of a large\\r\\nfamily. She hesitated in what she was saying, and rose. Mrs. Denham and\\r\\nJoan had drawn together and stood by the fireplace, slightly raising\\r\\ntheir skirts above their ankles, and discussing something which had\\r\\nan air of being very serious and very private. They appeared to have\\r\\nforgotten her presence among them. Ralph stood holding the door open for\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you come up to my room?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. And Katharine, glancing back at\\r\\nJoan, who smiled at her in a preoccupied way, followed Ralph upstairs.\\r\\nShe was thinking of their argument, and when, after the long climb, he\\r\\nopened his door, she began at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe question is, then, at what point is it right for the individual to\\r\\nassert his will against the will of the State.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time they continued the argument, and then the intervals\\r\\nbetween one statement and the next became longer and longer, and they\\r\\nspoke more speculatively and less pugnaciously, and at last fell silent.\\r\\nKatharine went over the argument in her mind, remembering how, now and\\r\\nthen, it had been set conspicuously on the right course by some remark\\r\\noffered either by James or by Johnnie.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYour brothers are very clever,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re in the\\r\\nhabit of arguing?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cJames and Johnnie will go on like that for hours,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSo\\r\\nwill Hester, if you start her upon Elizabethan dramatists.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd the little girl with the pigtail?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMolly? SheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s only ten. But theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re always arguing among themselves.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was immensely pleased by KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s praise of his brothers and\\r\\nsisters. He would have liked to go on telling her about them, but he\\r\\nchecked himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI see that it must be difficult to leave them,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine continued.\\r\\nHis deep pride in his family was more evident to him, at that moment,\\r\\nthan ever before, and the idea of living alone in a cottage was\\r\\nridiculous. All that brotherhood and sisterhood, and a common childhood\\r\\nin a common past mean, all the stability, the unambitious comradeship,\\r\\nand tacit understanding of family life at its best, came to his mind,\\r\\nand he thought of them as a company, of which he was the leader, bound\\r\\non a difficult, dreary, but glorious voyage. And it was Katharine who\\r\\nhad opened his eyes to this, he thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little dry chirp from the corner of the room now roused her attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy tame rook,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he explained briefly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA cat had bitten one of its\\r\\nlegs.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She looked at the rook, and her eyes went from one object to\\r\\nanother.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou sit here and read?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, her eyes resting upon his books. He\\r\\nsaid that he was in the habit of working there at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe great advantage of Highgate is the view over London. At night the\\r\\nview from my window is splendid.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He was extremely anxious that she\\r\\nshould appreciate his view, and she rose to see what was to be seen.\\r\\nIt was already dark enough for the turbulent haze to be yellow with the\\r\\nlight of street lamps, and she tried to determine the quarters of the\\r\\ncity beneath her. The sight of her gazing from his window gave him a\\r\\npeculiar satisfaction. When she turned, at length, he was still sitting\\r\\nmotionless in his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt must be late,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI must be going.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She settled upon the\\r\\narm of the chair irresolutely, thinking that she had no wish to go home.\\r\\nWilliam would be there, and he would find some way of making things\\r\\nunpleasant for her, and the memory of their quarrel came back to her.\\r\\nShe had noticed RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s coldness, too. She looked at him, and from his\\r\\nfixed stare she thought that he must be working out some theory, some\\r\\nargument. He had thought, perhaps, of some fresh point in his position,\\r\\nas to the bounds of personal liberty. She waited, silently, thinking\\r\\nabout liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve won again,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said at last, without moving.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve won?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she repeated, thinking of the argument.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wish to God I hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t asked you here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he burst out.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re here, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s different--IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m happy. YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve only to walk to\\r\\nthe window--youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve only to talk about liberty. When I saw you down there\\r\\namong them all--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He stopped short.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou thought how ordinary I was.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI tried to think so. But I thought you more wonderful than ever.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAn immense relief, and a reluctance to enjoy that relief, conflicted in\\r\\nher heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe slid down into the chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI thought you disliked me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGod knows I tried,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve done my best to see you as you\\r\\nare, without any of this damned romantic nonsense. That was why I asked\\r\\nyou here, and itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s increased my folly. When youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re gone I shall look\\r\\nout of that window and think of you. I shall waste the whole evening\\r\\nthinking of you. I shall waste my whole life, I believe.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe spoke with such vehemence that her relief disappeared; she frowned;\\r\\nand her tone changed to one almost of severity.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is what I foretold. We shall gain nothing but unhappiness. Look at\\r\\nme, Ralph.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He looked at her. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI assure you that IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m far more ordinary\\r\\nthan I appear. Beauty means nothing whatever. In fact, the most\\r\\nbeautiful women are generally the most stupid. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not that, but IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m a\\r\\nmatter-of-fact, prosaic, rather ordinary character; I order the dinner,\\r\\nI pay the bills, I do the accounts, I wind up the clock, and I never\\r\\nlook at a book.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou forget--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he began, but she would not let him speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou come and see me among flowers and pictures, and think me\\r\\nmysterious, romantic, and all the rest of it. Being yourself very\\r\\ninexperienced and very emotional, you go home and invent a story about\\r\\nme, and now you canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t separate me from the person youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve imagined me to\\r\\nbe. You call that, I suppose, being in love; as a matter of fact itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbeing in delusion. All romantic people are the same,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMy\\r\\nmother spends her life in making stories about the people sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s fond of.\\r\\nBut I wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have you do it about me, if I can help it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t help it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI warn you itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the source of all evil.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd of all good,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll find out that IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not what you think me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps. But I shall gain more than I lose.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf such gainÃ¢\\x80\\x99s worth having.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were silent for a space.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat may be what we have to face,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere may be nothing else.\\r\\nNothing but what we imagine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe reason of our loneliness,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she mused, and they were silent for a\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen are you to be married?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked abruptly, with a change of tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNot till September, I think. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s been put off.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be lonely then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAccording to what people say,\\r\\nmarriage is a very queer business. They say itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s different from anything\\r\\nelse. It may be true. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve known one or two cases where it seems to be\\r\\ntrue.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He hoped that she would go on with the subject. But she made\\r\\nno reply. He had done his best to master himself, and his voice was\\r\\nsufficiently indifferent, but her silence tormented him. She would never\\r\\nspeak to him of Rodney of her own accord, and her reserve left a whole\\r\\ncontinent of her soul in darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt may be put off even longer than that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, as if by an\\r\\nafterthought. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cSome one in the office is ill, and William has to take\\r\\nhis place. We may put it off for some time in fact.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s rather hard on him, isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe has his work,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe has lots of things that interest\\r\\nhim.... I know IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been to that place,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she broke off, pointing to\\r\\na photograph. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t remember where it is--oh, of course itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nOxford. Now, what about your cottage?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not going to take it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow you change your mind!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said impatiently. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s that I want to be where I\\r\\ncan see you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOur compact is going to hold in spite of all IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve said?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFor ever, so far as IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m concerned,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re going to go on dreaming and imagining and making up stories\\r\\nabout me as you walk along the street, and pretending that weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re riding\\r\\nin a forest, or landing on an island--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. I shall think of you ordering dinner, paying bills, doing the\\r\\naccounts, showing old ladies the relics--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s better,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou can think of me to-morrow morning\\r\\nlooking up dates in the Ã¢\\x80\\x98Dictionary of National Biography.Ã¢\\x80\\x99Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd forgetting your purse,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph added.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this she smiled, but in another moment her smile faded, either\\r\\nbecause of his words or of the way in which he spoke them. She was\\r\\ncapable of forgetting things. He saw that. But what more did he see? Was\\r\\nhe not looking at something she had never shown to anybody? Was it not\\r\\nsomething so profound that the notion of his seeing it almost shocked\\r\\nher? Her smile faded, and for a moment she seemed upon the point of\\r\\nspeaking, but looking at him in silence, with a look that seemed to ask\\r\\nwhat she could not put into words, she turned and bade him good night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nLike a strain of music, the effect of KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s presence slowly died\\r\\nfrom the room in which Ralph sat alone. The music had ceased in the\\r\\nrapture of its melody. He strained to catch the faintest lingering\\r\\nechoes; for a moment the memory lulled him into peace; but soon it\\r\\nfailed, and he paced the room so hungry for the sound to come again that\\r\\nhe was conscious of no other desire left in life. She had gone without\\r\\nspeaking; abruptly a chasm had been cut in his course, down which the\\r\\ntide of his being plunged in disorder; fell upon rocks; flung itself to\\r\\ndestruction. The distress had an effect of physical ruin and disaster.\\r\\nHe trembled; he was white; he felt exhausted, as if by a great physical\\r\\neffort. He sank at last into a chair standing opposite her empty one,\\r\\nand marked, mechanically, with his eye upon the clock, how she went\\r\\nfarther and farther from him, was home now, and now, doubtless, again\\r\\nwith Rodney. But it was long before he could realize these facts; the\\r\\nimmense desire for her presence churned his senses into foam, into\\r\\nfroth, into a haze of emotion that removed all facts from his grasp, and\\r\\ngave him a strange sense of distance, even from the material shapes of\\r\\nwall and window by which he was surrounded. The prospect of the future,\\r\\nnow that the strength of his passion was revealed to him, appalled him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marriage would take place in September, she had said; that allowed\\r\\nhim, then, six full months in which to undergo these terrible extremes\\r\\nof emotion. Six months of torture, and after that the silence of the\\r\\ngrave, the isolation of the insane, the exile of the damned; at best, a\\r\\nlife from which the chief good was knowingly and for ever excluded. An\\r\\nimpartial judge might have assured him that his chief hope of recovery\\r\\nlay in this mystic temper, which identified a living woman with much\\r\\nthat no human beings long possess in the eyes of each other; she would\\r\\npass, and the desire for her vanish, but his belief in what she stood\\r\\nfor, detached from her, would remain. This line of thought offered,\\r\\nperhaps, some respite, and possessed of a brain that had its station\\r\\nconsiderably above the tumult of the senses, he tried to reduce the\\r\\nvague and wandering incoherency of his emotions to order. The sense of\\r\\nself-preservation was strong in him, and Katharine herself had strangely\\r\\nrevived it by convincing him that his family deserved and needed all his\\r\\nstrength. She was right, and for their sake, if not for his own, this\\r\\npassion, which could bear no fruit, must be cut off, uprooted, shown\\r\\nto be as visionary and baseless as she had maintained. The best way of\\r\\nachieving this was not to run away from her, but to face her, and having\\r\\nsteeped himself in her qualities, to convince his reason that they were,\\r\\nas she assured him, not those that he imagined. She was a practical\\r\\nwoman, a domestic wife for an inferior poet, endowed with romantic\\r\\nbeauty by some freak of unintelligent Nature. No doubt her beauty itself\\r\\nwould not stand examination. He had the means of settling this point at\\r\\nleast. He possessed a book of photographs from the Greek statues; the\\r\\nhead of a goddess, if the lower part were concealed, had often given him\\r\\nthe ecstasy of being in KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s presence. He took it down from the\\r\\nshelf and found the picture. To this he added a note from her, bidding\\r\\nhim meet her at the Zoo. He had a flower which he had picked at Kew to\\r\\nteach her botany. Such were his relics. He placed them before him, and\\r\\nset himself to visualize her so clearly that no deception or delusion\\r\\nwas possible. In a second he could see her, with the sun slanting across\\r\\nher dress, coming towards him down the green walk at Kew. He made her\\r\\nsit upon the seat beside him. He heard her voice, so low and yet so\\r\\ndecided in its tone; she spoke reasonably of indifferent matters. He\\r\\ncould see her faults, and analyze her virtues. His pulse became quieter,\\r\\nand his brain increased in clarity. This time she could not escape him.\\r\\nThe illusion of her presence became more and more complete. They seemed\\r\\nto pass in and out of each otherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s minds, questioning and answering. The\\r\\nutmost fullness of communion seemed to be theirs. Thus united, he felt\\r\\nhimself raised to an eminence, exalted, and filled with a power of\\r\\nachievement such as he had never known in singleness. Once more he told\\r\\nover conscientiously her faults, both of face and character; they were\\r\\nclearly known to him; but they merged themselves in the flawless union\\r\\nthat was born of their association. They surveyed life to its uttermost\\r\\nlimits. How deep it was when looked at from this height! How sublime!\\r\\nHow the commonest things moved him almost to tears! Thus, he forgot\\r\\nthe inevitable limitations; he forgot her absence, he thought it of no\\r\\naccount whether she married him or another; nothing mattered, save\\r\\nthat she should exist, and that he should love her. Some words of these\\r\\nreflections were uttered aloud, and it happened that among them were\\r\\nthe words, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI love her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d It was the first time that he had used the word\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cloveÃ¢\\x80\\x9d to describe his feeling; madness, romance, hallucination--he had\\r\\ncalled it by these names before; but having, apparently by accident,\\r\\nstumbled upon the word Ã¢\\x80\\x9clove,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated it again and again with a\\r\\nsense of revelation.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m in love with you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed, with something like dismay. He\\r\\nleant against the window-sill, looking over the city as she had looked.\\r\\nEverything had become miraculously different and completely distinct.\\r\\nHis feelings were justified and needed no further explanation. But he\\r\\nmust impart them to some one, because his discovery was so important\\r\\nthat it concerned other people too. Shutting the book of Greek\\r\\nphotographs, and hiding his relics, he ran downstairs, snatched his\\r\\ncoat, and passed out of doors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lamps were being lit, but the streets were dark enough and empty\\r\\nenough to let him walk his fastest, and to talk aloud as he walked. He\\r\\nhad no doubt where he was going. He was going to find Mary Datchet. The\\r\\ndesire to share what he felt, with some one who understood it, was so\\r\\nimperious that he did not question it. He was soon in her street. He\\r\\nran up the stairs leading to her flat two steps at a time, and it never\\r\\ncrossed his mind that she might not be at home. As he rang her bell, he\\r\\nseemed to himself to be announcing the presence of something wonderful\\r\\nthat was separate from himself, and gave him power and authority over\\r\\nall other people. Mary came to the door after a momentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s pause. He was\\r\\nperfectly silent, and in the dusk his face looked completely white. He\\r\\nfollowed her into her room.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you know each other?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, to his extreme surprise, for he had\\r\\ncounted on finding her alone. A young man rose, and said that he knew\\r\\nRalph by sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe were just going through some papers,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Basnett has\\r\\nto help me, because I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know much about my work yet. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the new\\r\\nsociety,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she explained. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m the secretary. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m no longer at Russell\\r\\nSquare.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voice in which she gave this information was so constrained as to\\r\\nsound almost harsh.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat are your aims?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph. He looked neither at Mary nor at Mr.\\r\\nBasnett. Mr. Basnett thought he had seldom seen a more disagreeable\\r\\nor formidable man than this friend of MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s, this sarcastic-looking,\\r\\nwhite-faced Mr. Denham, who seemed to demand, as if by right, an account\\r\\nof their proposals, and to criticize them before he had heard them.\\r\\nNevertheless, he explained his projects as clearly as he could, and knew\\r\\nthat he wished Mr. Denham to think well of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI see,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph, when he had done. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cDÃ¢\\x80\\x99you know, Mary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he suddenly\\r\\nremarked, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI believe IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m in for a cold. Have you any quinine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The\\r\\nlook which he cast at her frightened her; it expressed mutely, perhaps\\r\\nwithout his own consciousness, something deep, wild, and passionate. She\\r\\nleft the room at once. Her heart beat fast at the knowledge of RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npresence; but it beat with pain, and with an extraordinary fear. She\\r\\nstood listening for a moment to the voices in the next room.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf course, I agree with you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she heard Ralph say, in this strange\\r\\nvoice, to Mr. Basnett. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s more that might be done. Have you\\r\\nseen Judson, for instance? You should make a point of getting him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary returned with the quinine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cJudsonÃ¢\\x80\\x99s address?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Basnett inquired, pulling out his notebook and\\r\\npreparing to write. For twenty minutes, perhaps, he wrote down names,\\r\\naddresses, and other suggestions that Ralph dictated to him. Then, when\\r\\nRalph fell silent, Mr. Basnett felt that his presence was not desired,\\r\\nand thanking Ralph for his help, with a sense that he was very young and\\r\\nignorant compared with him, he said good-bye.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph, directly Mr. Basnett had shut the door and they were\\r\\nalone together. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMary,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated. But the old difficulty of speaking\\r\\nto Mary without reserve prevented him from continuing. His desire to\\r\\nproclaim his love for Katharine was still strong in him, but he had\\r\\nfelt, directly he saw Mary, that he could not share it with her. The\\r\\nfeeling increased as he sat talking to Mr. Basnett. And yet all the time\\r\\nhe was thinking of Katharine, and marveling at his love. The tone in\\r\\nwhich he spoke MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s name was harsh.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is it, Ralph?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked, startled by his tone. She looked at him\\r\\nanxiously, and her little frown showed that she was trying painfully\\r\\nto understand him, and was puzzled. He could feel her groping for his\\r\\nmeaning, and he was annoyed with her, and thought how he had always\\r\\nfound her slow, painstaking, and clumsy. He had behaved badly to her,\\r\\ntoo, which made his irritation the more acute. Without waiting for him\\r\\nto answer, she rose as if his answer were indifferent to her, and began\\r\\nto put in order some papers that Mr. Basnett had left on the table. She\\r\\nhummed a scrap of a tune under her breath, and moved about the room as\\r\\nif she were occupied in making things tidy, and had no other concern.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll stay and dine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said casually, returning to her seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph replied. She did not press him further. They sat side by\\r\\nside without speaking, and Mary reached her hand for her work basket,\\r\\nand took out her sewing and threaded a needle.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a clever young man,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph observed, referring to Mr. Basnett.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m glad you thought so. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s tremendously interesting work, and\\r\\nconsidering everything, I think weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve done very well. But IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m inclined\\r\\nto agree with you; we ought to try to be more conciliatory. WeÃ¢\\x80\\x99re\\r\\nabsurdly strict. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s difficult to see that there may be sense in what\\r\\noneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s opponents say, though they are oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s opponents. Horace Basnett\\r\\nis certainly too uncompromising. I mustnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t forget to see that he writes\\r\\nthat letter to Judson. YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re too busy, I suppose, to come on to our\\r\\ncommittee?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She spoke in the most impersonal manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI may be out of town,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph replied, with equal distance of manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOur executive meets every week, of course,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she observed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut some of\\r\\nour members donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t come more than once a month. Members of Parliament are\\r\\nthe worst; it was a mistake, I think, to ask them.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went on sewing in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve not taken your quinine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, looking up and seeing the\\r\\ntabloids upon the mantelpiece.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph shortly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, you know best,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied tranquilly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMary, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m a brute!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHere I come and waste your time, and\\r\\ndo nothing but make myself disagreeable.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA cold coming on does make one feel wretched,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve not got a cold. That was a lie. ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s nothing the matter with\\r\\nme. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m mad, I suppose. I ought to have had the decency to keep away.\\r\\nBut I wanted to see you--I wanted to tell you--IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m in love, Mary.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He\\r\\nspoke the word, but, as he spoke it, it seemed robbed of substance.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn love, are you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said quietly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m glad, Ralph.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m in love. Anyhow, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m out of my mind. I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think, I\\r\\ncanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t work, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t care a hang for anything in the world. Good Heavens,\\r\\nMary! IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m in torment! One moment IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m happy; next IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m miserable. I hate\\r\\nher for half an hour; then IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d give my whole life to be with her for ten\\r\\nminutes; all the time I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know what I feel, or why I feel it; itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ninsanity, and yet itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s perfectly reasonable. Can you make any sense of\\r\\nit? Can you see whatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s happened? IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m raving, I know; donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t listen, Mary;\\r\\ngo on with your work.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose and began, as usual, to pace up and down the room. He knew that\\r\\nwhat he had just said bore very little resemblance to what he felt, for\\r\\nMaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s presence acted upon him like a very strong magnet, drawing from\\r\\nhim certain expressions which were not those he made use of when he\\r\\nspoke to himself, nor did they represent his deepest feelings. He felt\\r\\na little contempt for himself at having spoken thus; but somehow he had\\r\\nbeen forced into speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo sit down,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary suddenly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou make me so--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She spoke with\\r\\nunusual irritability, and Ralph, noticing it with surprise, sat down at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t told me her name--youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d rather not, I suppose?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHer name? Katharine Hilbery.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s engaged--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTo Rodney. TheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re to be married in September.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI see,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary. But in truth the calm of his manner, now that he was\\r\\nsitting down once more, wrapt her in the presence of something which she\\r\\nfelt to be so strong, so mysterious, so incalculable, that she scarcely\\r\\ndared to attempt to intercept it by any word or question that she was\\r\\nable to frame. She looked at Ralph blankly, with a kind of awe in her\\r\\nface, her lips slightly parted, and her brows raised. He was apparently\\r\\nquite unconscious of her gaze. Then, as if she could look no longer, she\\r\\nleant back in her chair, and half closed her eyes. The distance between\\r\\nthem hurt her terribly; one thing after another came into her mind,\\r\\ntempting her to assail Ralph with questions, to force him to confide\\r\\nin her, and to enjoy once more his intimacy. But she rejected every\\r\\nimpulse, for she could not speak without doing violence to some reserve\\r\\nwhich had grown between them, putting them a little far from each other,\\r\\nso that he seemed to her dignified and remote, like a person she no\\r\\nlonger knew well.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs there anything that I could do for you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked gently, and even\\r\\nwith courtesy, at length.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou could see her--no, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not what I want; you mustnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t bother about\\r\\nme, Mary.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He, too, spoke very gently.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid no third person can do anything to help,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he shook his head. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine was saying to-day how lonely we\\r\\nare.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She saw the effort with which he spoke KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s name, and\\r\\nbelieved that he forced himself to make amends now for his concealment\\r\\nin the past. At any rate, she was conscious of no anger against him; but\\r\\nrather of a deep pity for one condemned to suffer as she had suffered.\\r\\nBut in the case of Katharine it was different; she was indignant with\\r\\nKatharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s always work,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, a little aggressively.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph moved directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you want to be working now?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Sunday,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI was thinking of Katharine. She\\r\\ndoesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand about work. SheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s never had to. She doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know what\\r\\nwork is. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve only found out myself quite lately. But itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the thing\\r\\nthat saves one--IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure of that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere are other things, arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t there?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNothing that one can count upon,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she returned. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAfter all, other\\r\\npeople--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she stopped, but forced herself to go on. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhere should I be\\r\\nnow if I hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t got to go to my office every day? Thousands of people\\r\\nwould tell you the same thing--thousands of women. I tell you, work is\\r\\nthe only thing that saved me, Ralph.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He set his mouth, as if her words\\r\\nrained blows on him; he looked as if he had made up his mind to bear\\r\\nanything she might say, in silence. He had deserved it, and there would\\r\\nbe relief in having to bear it. But she broke off, and rose as if to\\r\\nfetch something from the next room. Before she reached the door she\\r\\nturned back, and stood facing him, self-possessed, and yet defiant and\\r\\nformidable in her composure.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all turned out splendidly for me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt will for you,\\r\\ntoo. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure of that. Because, after all, Katharine is worth it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMary--!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed. But her head was turned away, and he could not\\r\\nsay what he wished to say. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMary, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re splendid,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he concluded. She\\r\\nfaced him as he spoke, and gave him her hand. She had suffered and\\r\\nrelinquished, she had seen her future turned from one of infinite\\r\\npromise to one of barrenness, and yet, somehow, over what she scarcely\\r\\nknew, and with what results she could hardly foretell, she had\\r\\nconquered. With RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eyes upon her, smiling straight back at him\\r\\nserenely and proudly, she knew, for the first time, that she had\\r\\nconquered. She let him kiss her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe streets were empty enough on Sunday night, and if the Sabbath,\\r\\nand the domestic amusements proper to the Sabbath, had not kept people\\r\\nindoors, a high strong wind might very probably have done so. Ralph\\r\\nDenham was aware of a tumult in the street much in accordance with his\\r\\nown sensations. The gusts, sweeping along the Strand, seemed at the same\\r\\ntime to blow a clear space across the sky in which stars appeared, and\\r\\nfor a short time the quicks-peeding silver moon riding through clouds,\\r\\nas if they were waves of water surging round her and over her. They\\r\\nswamped her, but she emerged; they broke over her and covered her again;\\r\\nshe issued forth indomitable. In the country fields all the wreckage of\\r\\nwinter was being dispersed; the dead leaves, the withered bracken, the\\r\\ndry and discolored grass, but no bud would be broken, nor would the new\\r\\nstalks that showed above the earth take any harm, and perhaps to-morrow\\r\\na line of blue or yellow would show through a slit in their green. But\\r\\nthe whirl of the atmosphere alone was in DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s mood, and what of\\r\\nstar or blossom appeared was only as a light gleaming for a second upon\\r\\nheaped waves fast following each other. He had not been able to speak to\\r\\nMary, though for a moment he had come near enough to be tantalized by\\r\\na wonderful possibility of understanding. But the desire to communicate\\r\\nsomething of the very greatest importance possessed him completely; he\\r\\nstill wished to bestow this gift upon some other human being; he sought\\r\\ntheir company. More by instinct than by conscious choice, he took the\\r\\ndirection which led to RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s rooms. He knocked loudly upon his door;\\r\\nbut no one answered. He rang the bell. It took him some time to accept\\r\\nthe fact that Rodney was out. When he could no longer pretend that the\\r\\nsound of the wind in the old building was the sound of some one rising\\r\\nfrom his chair, he ran downstairs again, as if his goal had been altered\\r\\nand only just revealed to him. He walked in the direction of Chelsea.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut physical fatigue, for he had not dined and had tramped both far and\\r\\nfast, made him sit for a moment upon a seat on the Embankment. One\\r\\nof the regular occupants of those seats, an elderly man who had drunk\\r\\nhimself, probably, out of work and lodging, drifted up, begged a match,\\r\\nand sat down beside him. It was a windy night, he said; times were hard;\\r\\nsome long story of bad luck and injustice followed, told so often that\\r\\nthe man seemed to be talking to himself, or, perhaps, the neglect of\\r\\nhis audience had long made any attempt to catch their attention seem\\r\\nscarcely worth while. When he began to speak Ralph had a wild desire to\\r\\ntalk to him; to question him; to make him understand. He did, in fact,\\r\\ninterrupt him at one point; but it was useless. The ancient story of\\r\\nfailure, ill-luck, undeserved disaster, went down the wind, disconnected\\r\\nsyllables flying past RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s ears with a queer alternation of loudness\\r\\nand faintness as if, at certain moments, the manÃ¢\\x80\\x99s memory of his\\r\\nwrongs revived and then flagged, dying down at last into a grumble of\\r\\nresignation, which seemed to represent a final lapse into the accustomed\\r\\ndespair. The unhappy voice afflicted Ralph, but it also angered him. And\\r\\nwhen the elderly man refused to listen and mumbled on, an odd image came\\r\\nto his mind of a lighthouse besieged by the flying bodies of lost birds,\\r\\nwho were dashed senseless, by the gale, against the glass. He had a\\r\\nstrange sensation that he was both lighthouse and bird; he was steadfast\\r\\nand brilliant; and at the same time he was whirled, with all other\\r\\nthings, senseless against the glass. He got up, left his tribute of\\r\\nsilver, and pressed on, with the wind against him. The image of the\\r\\nlighthouse and the storm full of birds persisted, taking the place of\\r\\nmore definite thoughts, as he walked past the Houses of Parliament and\\r\\ndown Grosvenor Road, by the side of the river. In his state of physical\\r\\nfatigue, details merged themselves in the vaster prospect, of which\\r\\nthe flying gloom and the intermittent lights of lamp-posts and private\\r\\nhouses were the outward token, but he never lost his sense of walking\\r\\nin the direction of KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s house. He took it for granted that\\r\\nsomething would then happen, and, as he walked on, his mind became more\\r\\nand more full of pleasure and expectancy. Within a certain radius of her\\r\\nhouse the streets came under the influence of her presence. Each\\r\\nhouse had an individuality known to Ralph, because of the tremendous\\r\\nindividuality of the house in which she lived. For some yards before\\r\\nreaching the HilberysÃ¢\\x80\\x99 door he walked in a trance of pleasure, but\\r\\nwhen he reached it, and pushed the gate of the little garden open, he\\r\\nhesitated. He did not know what to do next. There was no hurry, however,\\r\\nfor the outside of the house held pleasure enough to last him some time\\r\\nlonger. He crossed the road, and leant against the balustrade of the\\r\\nEmbankment, fixing his eyes upon the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nLights burnt in the three long windows of the drawing-room. The space\\r\\nof the room behind became, in RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s vision, the center of the dark,\\r\\nflying wilderness of the world; the justification for the welter of\\r\\nconfusion surrounding it; the steady light which cast its beams, like\\r\\nthose of a lighthouse, with searching composure over the trackless\\r\\nwaste. In this little sanctuary were gathered together several different\\r\\npeople, but their identity was dissolved in a general glory of something\\r\\nthat might, perhaps, be called civilization; at any rate, all\\r\\ndryness, all safety, all that stood up above the surge and preserved\\r\\na consciousness of its own, was centered in the drawing-room of the\\r\\nHilberys. Its purpose was beneficent; and yet so far above his level as\\r\\nto have something austere about it, a light that cast itself out and yet\\r\\nkept itself aloof. Then he began, in his mind, to distinguish different\\r\\nindividuals within, consciously refusing as yet to attack the figure of\\r\\nKatharine. His thoughts lingered over Mrs. Hilbery and Cassandra; and\\r\\nthen he turned to Rodney and Mr. Hilbery. Physically, he saw them bathed\\r\\nin that steady flow of yellow light which filled the long oblongs of the\\r\\nwindows; in their movements they were beautiful; and in their speech he\\r\\nfigured a reserve of meaning, unspoken, but understood. At length, after\\r\\nall this half-conscious selection and arrangement, he allowed himself\\r\\nto approach the figure of Katharine herself; and instantly the scene\\r\\nwas flooded with excitement. He did not see her in the body; he seemed\\r\\ncuriously to see her as a shape of light, the light itself; he seemed,\\r\\nsimplified and exhausted as he was, to be like one of those lost birds\\r\\nfascinated by the lighthouse and held to the glass by the splendor of\\r\\nthe blaze.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese thoughts drove him to tramp a beat up and down the pavement before\\r\\nthe HilberysÃ¢\\x80\\x99 gate. He did not trouble himself to make any plans for the\\r\\nfuture. Something of an unknown kind would decide both the coming year\\r\\nand the coming hour. Now and again, in his vigil, he sought the light in\\r\\nthe long windows, or glanced at the ray which gilded a few leaves and\\r\\na few blades of grass in the little garden. For a long time the light\\r\\nburnt without changing. He had just reached the limit of his beat and\\r\\nwas turning, when the front door opened, and the aspect of the house was\\r\\nentirely changed. A black figure came down the little pathway and paused\\r\\nat the gate. Denham understood instantly that it was Rodney. Without\\r\\nhesitation, and conscious only of a great friendliness for any one\\r\\ncoming from that lighted room, he walked straight up to him and stopped\\r\\nhim. In the flurry of the wind Rodney was taken aback, and for the\\r\\nmoment tried to press on, muttering something, as if he suspected a\\r\\ndemand upon his charity.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGoodness, Denham, what are you doing here?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed, recognizing\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph mumbled something about being on his way home. They walked on\\r\\ntogether, though Rodney walked quick enough to make it plain that he had\\r\\nno wish for company.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was very unhappy. That afternoon Cassandra had repulsed him; he\\r\\nhad tried to explain to her the difficulties of the situation, and\\r\\nto suggest the nature of his feelings for her without saying anything\\r\\ndefinite or anything offensive to her. But he had lost his head; under\\r\\nthe goad of KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s ridicule he had said too much, and Cassandra,\\r\\nsuperb in her dignity and severity, had refused to hear another word,\\r\\nand threatened an immediate return to her home. His agitation, after an\\r\\nevening spent between the two women, was extreme. Moreover, he could not\\r\\nhelp suspecting that Ralph was wandering near the HilberysÃ¢\\x80\\x99 house, at\\r\\nthis hour, for reasons connected with Katharine. There was probably some\\r\\nunderstanding between them--not that anything of the kind mattered\\r\\nto him now. He was convinced that he had never cared for any one save\\r\\nCassandra, and KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s future was no concern of his. Aloud, he said,\\r\\nshortly, that he was very tired and wished to find a cab. But on Sunday\\r\\nnight, on the Embankment, cabs were hard to come by, and Rodney found\\r\\nhimself constrained to walk some distance, at any rate, in DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncompany. Denham maintained his silence. RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s irritation lapsed. He\\r\\nfound the silence oddly suggestive of the good masculine qualities which\\r\\nhe much respected, and had at this moment great reason to need. After\\r\\nthe mystery, difficulty, and uncertainty of dealing with the other sex,\\r\\nintercourse with oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s own is apt to have a composing and even ennobling\\r\\ninfluence, since plain speaking is possible and subterfuges of no avail.\\r\\nRodney, too, was much in need of a confidant; Katharine, despite her\\r\\npromises of help, had failed him at the critical moment; she had\\r\\ngone off with Denham; she was, perhaps, tormenting Denham as she had\\r\\ntormented him. How grave and stable he seemed, speaking little, and\\r\\nwalking firmly, compared with what Rodney knew of his own torments and\\r\\nindecisions! He began to cast about for some way of telling the story of\\r\\nhis relations with Katharine and Cassandra that would not lower him in\\r\\nDenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eyes. It then occurred to him that, perhaps, Katharine herself\\r\\nhad confided in Denham; they had something in common; it was likely that\\r\\nthey had discussed him that very afternoon. The desire to discover\\r\\nwhat they had said of him now came uppermost in his mind. He recalled\\r\\nKatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s laugh; he remembered that she had gone, laughing, to walk\\r\\nwith Denham.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid you stay long after weÃ¢\\x80\\x99d left?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. We went back to my house.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis seemed to confirm RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s belief that he had been discussed. He\\r\\nturned over the unpalatable idea for a while, in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWomen are incomprehensible creatures, Denham!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he then exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUm,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Denham, who seemed to himself possessed of complete\\r\\nunderstanding, not merely of women, but of the entire universe. He\\r\\ncould read Rodney, too, like a book. He knew that he was unhappy, and he\\r\\npitied him, and wished to help him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou say something and they--fly into a passion. Or for no reason at\\r\\nall, they laugh. I take it that no amount of education will--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The\\r\\nremainder of the sentence was lost in the high wind, against which they\\r\\nhad to struggle; but Denham understood that he referred to KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nlaughter, and that the memory of it was still hurting him. In comparison\\r\\nwith Rodney, Denham felt himself very secure; he saw Rodney as one of\\r\\nthe lost birds dashed senseless against the glass; one of the flying\\r\\nbodies of which the air was full. But he and Katharine were alone\\r\\ntogether, aloft, splendid, and luminous with a twofold radiance. He\\r\\npitied the unstable creature beside him; he felt a desire to protect\\r\\nhim, exposed without the knowledge which made his own way so direct.\\r\\nThey were united as the adventurous are united, though one reaches the\\r\\ngoal and the other perishes by the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t laugh at some one you cared for.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sentence, apparently addressed to no other human being, reached\\r\\nDenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s ears. The wind seemed to muffle it and fly away with it\\r\\ndirectly. Had Rodney spoken those words?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou love her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Was that his own voice, which seemed to sound in the air\\r\\nseveral yards in front of him?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve suffered tortures, Denham, tortures!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, I know that.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s laughed at me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNever--to me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind blew a space between the words--blew them so far away that they\\r\\nseemed unspoken.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve loved her!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was certainly spoken by the man at DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s side. The voice had all\\r\\nthe marks of RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s character, and recalled, with; strange vividness,\\r\\nhis personal appearance. Denham could see him against the blank\\r\\nbuildings and towers of the horizon. He saw him dignified, exalted, and\\r\\ntragic, as he might have appeared thinking of Katharine alone in his\\r\\nrooms at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am in love with Katharine myself. That is why I am here to-night.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph spoke distinctly and deliberately, as if RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s confession had\\r\\nmade this statement necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nRodney exclaimed something inarticulate.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve always known it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he cried, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve known it from the first.\\r\\nYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll marry her!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cry had a note of despair in it. Again the wind intercepted their\\r\\nwords. They said no more. At length they drew up beneath a lamp-post,\\r\\nsimultaneously.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy God, Denham, what fools we both are!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney exclaimed. They looked\\r\\nat each other, queerly, in the light of the lamp. Fools! They seemed to\\r\\nconfess to each other the extreme depths of their folly. For the moment,\\r\\nunder the lamp-post, they seemed to be aware of some common knowledge\\r\\nwhich did away with the possibility of rivalry, and made them feel\\r\\nmore sympathy for each other than for any one else in the world.\\r\\nGiving simultaneously a little nod, as if in confirmation of this\\r\\nunderstanding, they parted without speaking again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIX\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween twelve and one that Sunday night Katharine lay in bed, not\\r\\nasleep, but in that twilight region where a detached and humorous view\\r\\nof our own lot is possible; or if we must be serious, our seriousness is\\r\\ntempered by the swift oncome of slumber and oblivion. She saw the forms\\r\\nof Ralph, William, Cassandra, and herself, as if they were all equally\\r\\nunsubstantial, and, in putting off reality, had gained a kind of dignity\\r\\nwhich rested upon each impartially. Thus rid of any uncomfortable warmth\\r\\nof partisanship or load of obligation, she was dropping off to sleep\\r\\nwhen a light tap sounded upon her door. A moment later Cassandra stood\\r\\nbeside her, holding a candle and speaking in the low tones proper to the\\r\\ntime of night.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you awake, Katharine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m awake. What is it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe roused herself, sat up, and asked what in HeavenÃ¢\\x80\\x99s name Cassandra\\r\\nwas doing?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t sleep, and I thought IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d come and speak to you--only for a\\r\\nmoment, though. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m going home to-morrow.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHome? Why, what has happened?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSomething happened to-day which makes it impossible for me to stay\\r\\nhere.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra spoke formally, almost solemnly; the announcement was clearly\\r\\nprepared and marked a crisis of the utmost gravity. She continued what\\r\\nseemed to be part of a set speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have decided to tell you the whole truth, Katharine. William allowed\\r\\nhimself to behave in a way which made me extremely uncomfortable\\r\\nto-day.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine seemed to waken completely, and at once to be in control of\\r\\nherself.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt the Zoo?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, on the way home. When we had tea.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if foreseeing that the interview might be long, and the night chilly,\\r\\nKatharine advised Cassandra to wrap herself in a quilt. Cassandra did so\\r\\nwith unbroken solemnity.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a train at eleven,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI shall tell Aunt Maggie that\\r\\nI have to go suddenly.... I shall make VioletÃ¢\\x80\\x99s visit an excuse. But,\\r\\nafter thinking it over, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see how I can go without telling you the\\r\\ntruth.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was careful to abstain from looking in KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s direction. There\\r\\nwas a slight pause.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see the least reason why you should go,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine\\r\\neventually. Her voice sounded so astonishingly equable that Cassandra\\r\\nglanced at her. It was impossible to suppose that she was either\\r\\nindignant or surprised; she seemed, on the contrary, sitting up in bed,\\r\\nwith her arms clasped round her knees and a little frown on her brow, to\\r\\nbe thinking closely upon a matter of indifference to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t allow any man to behave to me in that way,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra\\r\\nreplied, and she added, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cparticularly when I know that he is engaged to\\r\\nsome one else.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut you like him, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s got nothing to do with it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra exclaimed indignantly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nconsider his conduct, under the circumstances, most disgraceful.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the last of the sentences of her premeditated speech; and\\r\\nhaving spoken it she was left unprovided with any more to say in that\\r\\nparticular style. When Katharine remarked:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should say it had everything to do with it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nself-possession deserted her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand you in the least, Katharine. How can you behave as\\r\\nyou behave? Ever since I came here IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been amazed by you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve enjoyed yourself, havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I have,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra admitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnyhow, my behavior hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t spoiled your visit.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra allowed once more. She was completely at a loss. In her\\r\\nforecast of the interview she had taken it for granted that Katharine,\\r\\nafter an outburst of incredulity, would agree that Cassandra must return\\r\\nhome as soon as possible. But Katharine, on the contrary, accepted her\\r\\nstatement at once, seemed neither shocked nor surprised, and merely\\r\\nlooked rather more thoughtful than usual. From being a mature woman\\r\\ncharged with an important mission, Cassandra shrunk to the stature of an\\r\\ninexperienced child.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you think IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been very foolish about it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine made no answer, but still sat deliberating silently, and a\\r\\ncertain feeling of alarm took possession of Cassandra. Perhaps her\\r\\nwords had struck far deeper than she had thought, into depths beyond\\r\\nher reach, as so much of Katharine was beyond her reach. She thought\\r\\nsuddenly that she had been playing with very dangerous tools.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at her at length, Katharine asked slowly, as if she found the\\r\\nquestion very difficult to ask.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut do you care for William?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe marked the agitation and bewilderment of the girlÃ¢\\x80\\x99s expression, and\\r\\nhow she looked away from her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you mean, am I in love with him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra asked, breathing\\r\\nquickly, and nervously moving her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, in love with him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow can I love the man youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re engaged to marry?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra burst out.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe may be in love with you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve any right to say such things, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Cassandra exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy do you say them? DonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you mind in the least\\r\\nhow William behaves to other women? If I were engaged, I couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t bear\\r\\nit!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWeÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not engaged,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, after a pause.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not engaged,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine repeated. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut no one knows it but\\r\\nourselves.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut why--I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand--youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not engaged!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra said again.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, that explains it! YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not in love with him! You donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to\\r\\nmarry him!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t in love with each other any longer,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, as if\\r\\ndisposing of something for ever and ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow queer, how strange, how unlike other people you are, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Cassandra said, her whole body and voice seeming to fall and collapse\\r\\ntogether, and no trace of anger or excitement remaining, but only a\\r\\ndreamy quietude.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not in love with him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut I love him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra remained bowed, as if by the weight of the revelation, for\\r\\nsome little while longer. Nor did Katharine speak. Her attitude was\\r\\nthat of some one who wishes to be concealed as much as possible from\\r\\nobservation. She sighed profoundly; she was absolutely silent, and\\r\\napparently overcome by her thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDÃ¢\\x80\\x99you know what time it is?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said at length, and shook her pillow,\\r\\nas if making ready for sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra rose obediently, and once more took up her candle. Perhaps the\\r\\nwhite dressing-gown, and the loosened hair, and something unseeing in\\r\\nthe expression of the eyes gave her a likeness to a woman walking in her\\r\\nsleep. Katharine, at least, thought so.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no reason why I should go home, then?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra said, pausing.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUnless you want me to go, Katharine? What DO you want me to do?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time their eyes met.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou wanted us to fall in love,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra exclaimed, as if she read the\\r\\ncertainty there. But as she looked she saw a sight that surprised her.\\r\\nThe tears rose slowly in KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eyes and stood there, brimming\\r\\nbut contained--the tears of some profound emotion, happiness, grief,\\r\\nrenunciation; an emotion so complex in its nature that to express it was\\r\\nimpossible, and Cassandra, bending her head and receiving the tears upon\\r\\nher cheek, accepted them in silence as the consecration of her love.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPlease, miss,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said the maid, about eleven oÃ¢\\x80\\x99clock on the following\\r\\nmorning, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cMrs. Milvain is in the kitchen.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA long wicker basket of flowers and branches had arrived from the\\r\\ncountry, and Katharine, kneeling upon the floor of the drawing-room,\\r\\nwas sorting them while Cassandra watched her from an arm-chair, and\\r\\nabsent-mindedly made spasmodic offers of help which were not accepted.\\r\\nThe maidÃ¢\\x80\\x99s message had a curious effect upon Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe rose, walked to the window, and, the maid being gone, said\\r\\nemphatically and even tragically:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know what that means.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra had understood nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAunt Celia is in the kitchen,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy in the kitchen?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra asked, not unnaturally.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cProbably because sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s discovered something,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied.\\r\\nCassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s thoughts flew to the subject of her preoccupation.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAbout us?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHeaven knows,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI shanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t let her stay in the\\r\\nkitchen, though. I shall bring her up here.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sternness with which this was said suggested that to bring Aunt\\r\\nCelia upstairs was, for some reason, a disciplinary measure.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFor goodnessÃ¢\\x80\\x99 sake, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra exclaimed, jumping from her\\r\\nchair and showing signs of agitation, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be rash. DonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t let her\\r\\nsuspect. Remember, nothingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s certain--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine assured her by nodding her head several times, but the manner\\r\\nin which she left the room was not calculated to inspire complete\\r\\nconfidence in her diplomacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Milvain was sitting, or rather perching, upon the edge of a chair\\r\\nin the servantsÃ¢\\x80\\x99 room. Whether there was any sound reason for her choice\\r\\nof a subterranean chamber, or whether it corresponded with the spirit of\\r\\nher quest, Mrs. Milvain invariably came in by the back door and sat\\r\\nin the servantsÃ¢\\x80\\x99 room when she was engaged in confidential family\\r\\ntransactions. The ostensible reason she gave was that neither Mr. nor\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery should be disturbed. But, in truth, Mrs. Milvain depended\\r\\neven more than most elderly women of her generation upon the delicious\\r\\nemotions of intimacy, agony, and secrecy, and the additional thrill\\r\\nprovided by the basement was one not lightly to be forfeited. She\\r\\nprotested almost plaintively when Katharine proposed to go upstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve something that I want to say to you in PRIVATE,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said,\\r\\nhesitating reluctantly upon the threshold of her ambush.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe drawing-room is empty--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut we might meet your mother upon the stairs. We might disturb your\\r\\nfather,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Milvain objected, taking the precaution to speak in a\\r\\nwhisper already.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s presence was absolutely necessary to the success\\r\\nof the interview, and as Katharine obstinately receded up the kitchen\\r\\nstairs, Mrs. Milvain had no course but to follow her. She glanced\\r\\nfurtively about her as she proceeded upstairs, drew her skirts together,\\r\\nand stepped with circumspection past all doors, whether they were open\\r\\nor shut.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNobody will overhear us?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she murmured, when the comparative sanctuary\\r\\nof the drawing-room had been reached. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI see that I have interrupted\\r\\nyou,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, glancing at the flowers strewn upon the floor. A\\r\\nmoment later she inquired, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWas some one sitting with you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d noticing a\\r\\nhandkerchief that Cassandra had dropped in her flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCassandra was helping me to put the flowers in water,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine,\\r\\nand she spoke so firmly and clearly that Mrs. Milvain glanced nervously\\r\\nat the main door and then at the curtain which divided the little room\\r\\nwith the relics from the drawing-room.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, Cassandra is still with you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she remarked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd did William send\\r\\nyou those lovely flowers?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine sat down opposite her aunt and said neither yes nor no. She\\r\\nlooked past her, and it might have been thought that she was considering\\r\\nvery critically the pattern of the curtains. Another advantage of\\r\\nthe basement, from Mrs. MilvainÃ¢\\x80\\x99s point of view, was that it made it\\r\\nnecessary to sit very close together, and the light was dim compared\\r\\nwith that which now poured through three windows upon Katharine and\\r\\nthe basket of flowers, and gave even the slight angular figure of Mrs.\\r\\nMilvain herself a halo of gold.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re from Stogdon House,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine abruptly, with a little\\r\\njerk of her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Milvain felt that it would be easier to tell her niece what\\r\\nshe wished to say if they were actually in physical contact, for the\\r\\nspiritual distance between them was formidable. Katharine, however, made\\r\\nno overtures, and Mrs. Milvain, who was possessed of rash but heroic\\r\\ncourage, plunged without preface:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPeople are talking about you, Katharine. That is why I have come this\\r\\nmorning. You forgive me for saying what IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d much rather not say? What I\\r\\nsay is only for your own sake, my child.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s nothing to forgive yet, Aunt Celia,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, with\\r\\napparent good humor.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPeople are saying that William goes everywhere with you and Cassandra,\\r\\nand that he is always paying her attentions. At the MarkhamsÃ¢\\x80\\x99 dance he\\r\\nsat out five dances with her. At the Zoo they were seen alone together.\\r\\nThey left together. They never came back here till seven in the evening.\\r\\nBut that is not all. They say his manner is very marked--he is quite\\r\\ndifferent when she is there.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Milvain, whose words had run themselves together, and whose voice\\r\\nhad raised its tone almost to one of protest, here ceased, and looked\\r\\nintently at Katharine, as if to judge the effect of her communication. A\\r\\nslight rigidity had passed over KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s face. Her lips were pressed\\r\\ntogether; her eyes were contracted, and they were still fixed upon the\\r\\ncurtain. These superficial changes covered an extreme inner loathing\\r\\nsuch as might follow the display of some hideous or indecent spectacle.\\r\\nThe indecent spectacle was her own action beheld for the first time from\\r\\nthe outside; her auntÃ¢\\x80\\x99s words made her realize how infinitely repulsive\\r\\nthe body of life is without its soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said at length.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Milvain made a gesture as if to bring her closer, but it was not\\r\\nreturned.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe all know how good you are--how unselfish--how you sacrifice yourself\\r\\nto others. But youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been too unselfish, Katharine. You have made\\r\\nCassandra happy, and she has taken advantage of your goodness.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand, Aunt Celia,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat has Cassandra\\r\\ndone?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCassandra has behaved in a way that I could not have thought possible,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Mrs. Milvain warmly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe has been utterly selfish--utterly\\r\\nheartless. I must speak to her before I go.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t understand,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine persisted.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Milvain looked at her. Was it possible that Katharine really\\r\\ndoubted? That there was something that Mrs. Milvain herself did not\\r\\nunderstand? She braced herself, and pronounced the tremendous words:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCassandra has stolen WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s love.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nStill the words seemed to have curiously little effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you mean,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat he has fallen in love with her?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere are ways of MAKING men fall in love with one, Katharine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine remained silent. The silence alarmed Mrs. Milvain, and she\\r\\nbegan hurriedly:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNothing would have made me say these things but your own good. I have\\r\\nnot wished to interfere; I have not wished to give you pain. I am a\\r\\nuseless old woman. I have no children of my own. I only want to see you\\r\\nhappy, Katharine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain she stretched forth her arms, but they remained empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou are not going to say these things to Cassandra,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine\\r\\nsuddenly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve said them to me; thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s enough.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine spoke so low and with such restraint that Mrs. Milvain had\\r\\nto strain to catch her words, and when she heard them she was dazed by\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve made you angry! I knew I should!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed. She quivered, and\\r\\na kind of sob shook her; but even to have made Katharine angry was some\\r\\nrelief, and allowed her to feel some of the agreeable sensations of\\r\\nmartyrdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, standing up, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m so angry that I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want\\r\\nto say anything more. I think youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d better go, Aunt Celia. We donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nunderstand each other.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these words Mrs. Milvain looked for a moment terribly apprehensive;\\r\\nshe glanced at her nieceÃ¢\\x80\\x99s face, but read no pity there, whereupon\\r\\nshe folded her hands upon a black velvet bag which she carried in an\\r\\nattitude that was almost one of prayer. Whatever divinity she prayed to,\\r\\nif pray she did, at any rate she recovered her dignity in a singular way\\r\\nand faced her niece.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMarried love,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said slowly and with emphasis upon every word, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis\\r\\nthe most sacred of all loves. The love of husband and wife is the most\\r\\nholy we know. That is the lesson MammaÃ¢\\x80\\x99s children learnt from her; that\\r\\nis what they can never forget. I have tried to speak as she would have\\r\\nwished her daughter to speak. You are her grandchild.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine seemed to judge this defence upon its merits, and then to\\r\\nconvict it of falsity.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see that there is any excuse for your behavior,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these words Mrs. Milvain rose and stood for a moment beside her\\r\\nniece. She had never met with such treatment before, and she did not\\r\\nknow with what weapons to break down the terrible wall of resistance\\r\\noffered her by one who, by virtue of youth and beauty and sex, should\\r\\nhave been all tears and supplications. But Mrs. Milvain herself was\\r\\nobstinate; upon a matter of this kind she could not admit that she was\\r\\neither beaten or mistaken. She beheld herself the champion of married\\r\\nlove in its purity and supremacy; what her niece stood for she was quite\\r\\nunable to say, but she was filled with the gravest suspicions. The old\\r\\nwoman and the young woman stood side by side in unbroken silence. Mrs.\\r\\nMilvain could not make up her mind to withdraw while her principles\\r\\ntrembled in the balance and her curiosity remained unappeased. She\\r\\nransacked her mind for some question that should force Katharine to\\r\\nenlighten her, but the supply was limited, the choice difficult, and\\r\\nwhile she hesitated the door opened and William Rodney came in. He\\r\\ncarried in his hand an enormous and splendid bunch of white and purple\\r\\nflowers, and, either not seeing Mrs. Milvain, or disregarding her,\\r\\nhe advanced straight to Katharine, and presented the flowers with the\\r\\nwords:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThese are for you, Katharine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine took them with a glance that Mrs. Milvain did not fail to\\r\\nintercept. But with all her experience, she did not know what to make of\\r\\nit. She watched anxiously for further illumination. William greeted her\\r\\nwithout obvious sign of guilt, and, explaining that he had a holiday,\\r\\nboth he and Katharine seemed to take it for granted that his holiday\\r\\nshould be celebrated with flowers and spent in Cheyne Walk. A pause\\r\\nfollowed; that, too, was natural; and Mrs. Milvain began to feel that\\r\\nshe laid herself open to a charge of selfishness if she stayed. The\\r\\nmere presence of a young man had altered her disposition curiously, and\\r\\nfilled her with a desire for a scene which should end in an emotional\\r\\nforgiveness. She would have given much to clasp both nephew and niece\\r\\nin her arms. But she could not flatter herself that any hope of the\\r\\ncustomary exaltation remained.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI must go,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, and she was conscious of an extreme flatness of\\r\\nspirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither of them said anything to stop her. William politely escorted her\\r\\ndownstairs, and somehow, amongst her protests and embarrassments, Mrs.\\r\\nMilvain forgot to say good-bye to Katharine. She departed, murmuring\\r\\nwords about masses of flowers and a drawing-room always beautiful even\\r\\nin the depths of winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam came back to Katharine; he found her standing where he had left\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve come to be forgiven,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOur quarrel was perfectly hateful\\r\\nto me. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve not slept all night. YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not angry with me, are you,\\r\\nKatharine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not bring herself to answer him until she had rid her mind of\\r\\nthe impression that her aunt had made on her. It seemed to her that the\\r\\nvery flowers were contaminated, and CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s pocket-handkerchief, for\\r\\nMrs. Milvain had used them for evidence in her investigations.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s been spying upon us,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfollowing us about London,\\r\\noverhearing what people are saying--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMrs. Milvain?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhat has she told you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis air of open confidence entirely vanished.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, people are saying that youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re in love with Cassandra, and that you\\r\\ndonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t care for me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey have seen us?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cEverything weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve done for a fortnight has been seen.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI told you that would happen!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked to the window in evident perturbation. Katharine was too\\r\\nindignant to attend to him. She was swept away by the force of her own\\r\\nanger. Clasping RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s flowers, she stood upright and motionless.\\r\\n\\r\\nRodney turned away from the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all been a mistake,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI blame myself for it. I should\\r\\nhave known better. I let you persuade me in a moment of madness. I beg\\r\\nyou to forget my insanity, Katharine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe wished even to persecute Cassandra!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine burst out, not\\r\\nlistening to him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe threatened to speak to her. SheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s capable of\\r\\nit--sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s capable of anything!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMrs. Milvain is not tactful, I know, but you exaggerate, Katharine.\\r\\nPeople are talking about us. She was right to tell us. It only confirms\\r\\nmy own feeling--the position is monstrous.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length Katharine realized some part of what he meant.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t mean that this influences you, William?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked in\\r\\namazement.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt does,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, flushing. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s intensely disagreeable to me. I\\r\\ncanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t endure that people should gossip about us. And then thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s your\\r\\ncousin--Cassandra--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He paused in embarrassment.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI came here this morning, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he resumed, with a change of\\r\\nvoice, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cto ask you to forget my folly, my bad temper, my inconceivable\\r\\nbehavior. I came, Katharine, to ask whether we canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t return to the\\r\\nposition we were in before this--this season of lunacy. Will you take me\\r\\nback, Katharine, once more and for ever?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt her beauty, intensified by emotion and enhanced by the flowers\\r\\nof bright color and strange shape which she carried wrought upon Rodney,\\r\\nand had its share in bestowing upon her the old romance. But a less\\r\\nnoble passion worked in him, too; he was inflamed by jealousy. His\\r\\ntentative offer of affection had been rudely and, as he thought,\\r\\ncompletely repulsed by Cassandra on the preceding day. DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nconfession was in his mind. And ultimately, KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s dominion over\\r\\nhim was of the sort that the fevers of the night cannot exorcise.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI was as much to blame as you were yesterday,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said gently,\\r\\ndisregarding his question. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI confess, William, the sight of you and\\r\\nCassandra together made me jealous, and I couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t control myself. I\\r\\nlaughed at you, I know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou jealous!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI assure you, Katharine, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve not\\r\\nthe slightest reason to be jealous. Cassandra dislikes me, so far as she\\r\\nfeels about me at all. I was foolish enough to try to explain the nature\\r\\nof our relationship. I couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t resist telling her what I supposed\\r\\nmyself to feel for her. She refused to listen, very rightly. But she\\r\\nleft me in no doubt of her scorn.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine hesitated. She was confused, agitated, physically tired, and\\r\\nhad already to reckon with the violent feeling of dislike aroused by her\\r\\naunt which still vibrated through all the rest of her feelings. She sank\\r\\ninto a chair and dropped her flowers upon her lap.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe charmed me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney continued. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI thought I loved her. But thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\na thing of the past. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all over, Katharine. It was a dream--an\\r\\nhallucination. We were both equally to blame, but no harmÃ¢\\x80\\x99s done if you\\r\\nbelieve how truly I care for you. Say you believe me!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood over her, as if in readiness to seize the first sign of her\\r\\nassent. Precisely at that moment, owing, perhaps, to her vicissitudes\\r\\nof feeling, all sense of love left her, as in a moment a mist lifts from\\r\\nthe earth. And when the mist departed a skeleton world and blankness\\r\\nalone remained--a terrible prospect for the eyes of the living to\\r\\nbehold. He saw the look of terror in her face, and without understanding\\r\\nits origin, took her hand in his. With the sense of companionship\\r\\nreturned a desire, like that of a child for shelter, to accept what he\\r\\nhad to offer her--and at that moment it seemed that he offered her the\\r\\nonly thing that could make it tolerable to live. She let him press his\\r\\nlips to her cheek, and leant her head upon his arm. It was the moment of\\r\\nhis triumph. It was the only moment in which she belonged to him and was\\r\\ndependent upon his protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, yes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he murmured, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou accept me, Katharine. You love me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment she remained silent. He then heard her murmur:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCassandra loves you more than I do.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCassandra?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe loves you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine repeated. She raised herself and repeated the\\r\\nsentence yet a third time. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe loves you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam slowly raised himself. He believed instinctively what Katharine\\r\\nsaid, but what it meant to him he was unable to understand. Could\\r\\nCassandra love him? Could she have told Katharine that she loved him?\\r\\nThe desire to know the truth of this was urgent, unknown though the\\r\\nconsequences might be. The thrill of excitement associated with the\\r\\nthought of Cassandra once more took possession of him. No longer was it\\r\\nthe excitement of anticipation and ignorance; it was the excitement\\r\\nof something greater than a possibility, for now he knew her and had\\r\\nmeasure of the sympathy between them. But who could give him certainty?\\r\\nCould Katharine, Katharine who had lately lain in his arms, Katharine\\r\\nherself the most admired of women? He looked at her, with doubt, and\\r\\nwith anxiety, but said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, yes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, interpreting his wish for assurance, Ã¢\\x80\\x9citÃ¢\\x80\\x99s true. I\\r\\nknow what she feels for you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe loves me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, but who knows what I feel? How can I be sure of my feeling myself?\\r\\nTen minutes ago I asked you to marry me. I still wish it--I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know\\r\\nwhat I wish--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe clenched his hands and turned away. He suddenly faced her and\\r\\ndemanded: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTell me what you feel for Denham.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFor Ralph Denham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed, as if she had found\\r\\nthe answer to some momentarily perplexing question. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re jealous\\r\\nof me, William; but youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not in love with me. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m jealous of you.\\r\\nTherefore, for both our sakes, I say, speak to Cassandra at once.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tried to compose himself. He walked up and down the room; he paused\\r\\nat the window and surveyed the flowers strewn upon the floor. Meanwhile\\r\\nhis desire to have KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s assurance confirmed became so insistent\\r\\nthat he could no longer deny the overmastering strength of his feeling\\r\\nfor Cassandra.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed, coming to a standstill and rapping his\\r\\nknuckles sharply upon a small table carrying one slender vase. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI love\\r\\nCassandra.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he said this, the curtains hanging at the door of the little room\\r\\nparted, and Cassandra herself stepped forth.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have overheard every word!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pause succeeded this announcement. Rodney made a step forward and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen you know what I wish to ask you. Give me your answer--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe put her hands before her face; she turned away and seemed to shrink\\r\\nfrom both of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat Katharine said,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she murmured. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, raising her head\\r\\nwith a look of fear from the kiss with which he greeted her admission,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9chow frightfully difficult it all is! Our feelings, I mean--yours and\\r\\nmine and KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s. Katharine, tell me, are we doing right?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRight--of course weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re doing right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William answered her, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cif,\\r\\nafter what youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve heard, you can marry a man of such incomprehensible\\r\\nconfusion, such deplorable--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t, William,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine interposed; Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCassandra has heard us; she can\\r\\njudge what we are; she knows better than we could tell her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, still holding WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s hand, questions and desires welled up in\\r\\nCassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s heart. Had she done wrong in listening? Why did Aunt Celia\\r\\nblame her? Did Katharine think her right? Above all, did William really\\r\\nlove her, for ever and ever, better than any one?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI must be first with him, Katharine!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t share him\\r\\neven with you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI shall never ask that,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine. She moved a little away from\\r\\nwhere they sat and began half-consciously sorting her flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve shared with me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t I share with\\r\\nyou? Why am I so mean? I know why it is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe understand each\\r\\nother, William and I. YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve never understood each other. YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re too\\r\\ndifferent.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve never admired anybody more,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William interposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not thatÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--Cassandra tried to enlighten him--Ã¢\\x80\\x9citÃ¢\\x80\\x99s understanding.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave I never understood you, Katharine? Have I been very selfish?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra interposed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve asked her for sympathy, and sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nnot sympathetic; youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve wanted her to be practical, and sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not\\r\\npractical. YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been selfish; youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been exacting--and so has\\r\\nKatharine--but it wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t anybodyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s fault.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine had listened to this attempt at analysis with keen attention.\\r\\nCassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s words seemed to rub the old blurred image of life and\\r\\nfreshen it so marvelously that it looked new again. She turned to\\r\\nWilliam.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s quite true,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt was nobodyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s fault.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere are many things that heÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll always come to you for,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra\\r\\ncontinued, still reading from her invisible book. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI accept that,\\r\\nKatharine. I shall never dispute it. I want to be generous as youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\nbeen generous. But being in love makes it more difficult for me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were silent. At length William broke the silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOne thing I beg of you both,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, and the old nervousness of\\r\\nmanner returned as he glanced at Katharine. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe will never discuss these\\r\\nmatters again. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not that IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m timid and conventional, as you think,\\r\\nKatharine. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s that it spoils things to discuss them; it unsettles\\r\\npeopleÃ¢\\x80\\x99s minds; and now weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re all so happy--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra ratified this conclusion so far as she was concerned, and\\r\\nWilliam, after receiving the exquisite pleasure of her glance, with its\\r\\nabsolute affection and trust, looked anxiously at Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m happy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she assured him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd I agree. We will never talk\\r\\nabout it again.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, Katharine, Katharine!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra cried, holding out her arms while\\r\\nthe tears ran down her cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXX\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day was so different from other days to three people in the house\\r\\nthat the common routine of household life--the maid waiting at table,\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery writing a letter, the clock striking, and the door opening,\\r\\nand all the other signs of long-established civilization appeared\\r\\nsuddenly to have no meaning save as they lulled Mr. and Mrs. Hilbery\\r\\ninto the belief that nothing unusual had taken place. It chanced that\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery was depressed without visible cause, unless a certain\\r\\ncrudeness verging upon coarseness in the temper of her favorite\\r\\nElizabethans could be held responsible for the mood. At any rate, she\\r\\nhad shut up Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe Duchess of MalfiÃ¢\\x80\\x9d with a sigh, and wished to know, so\\r\\nshe told Rodney at dinner, whether there wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t some young writer with\\r\\na touch of the great spirit--somebody who made you believe that life\\r\\nwas BEAUTIFUL? She got little help from Rodney, and after singing\\r\\nher plaintive requiem for the death of poetry by herself, she charmed\\r\\nherself into good spirits again by remembering the existence of Mozart.\\r\\nShe begged Cassandra to play to her, and when they went upstairs\\r\\nCassandra opened the piano directly, and did her best to create an\\r\\natmosphere of unmixed beauty. At the sound of the first notes Katharine\\r\\nand Rodney both felt an enormous sense of relief at the license which\\r\\nthe music gave them to loosen their hold upon the mechanism of behavior.\\r\\nThey lapsed into the depths of thought. Mrs. Hilbery was soon spirited\\r\\naway into a perfectly congenial mood, that was half reverie and half\\r\\nslumber, half delicious melancholy and half pure bliss. Mr. Hilbery\\r\\nalone attended. He was extremely musical, and made Cassandra aware that\\r\\nhe listened to every note. She played her best, and won his approval.\\r\\nLeaning slightly forward in his chair, and turning his little green\\r\\nstone, he weighed the intention of her phrases approvingly, but stopped\\r\\nher suddenly to complain of a noise behind him. The window was unhasped.\\r\\nHe signed to Rodney, who crossed the room immediately to put the matter\\r\\nright. He stayed a moment longer by the window than was, perhaps,\\r\\nnecessary, and having done what was needed, drew his chair a little\\r\\ncloser than before to KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s side. The music went on. Under cover\\r\\nof some exquisite run of melody, he leant towards her and whispered\\r\\nsomething. She glanced at her father and mother, and a moment later left\\r\\nthe room, almost unobserved, with Rodney.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked, as soon as the door was shut.\\r\\n\\r\\nRodney made no answer, but led her downstairs into the dining-room on\\r\\nthe ground floor. Even when he had shut the door he said nothing, but\\r\\nwent straight to the window and parted the curtains. He beckoned to\\r\\nKatharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere he is again,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLook, there--under the lamp-post.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine looked. She had no idea what Rodney was talking about. A vague\\r\\nfeeling of alarm and mystery possessed her. She saw a man standing on\\r\\nthe opposite side of the road facing the house beneath a lamp-post. As\\r\\nthey looked the figure turned, walked a few steps, and came back again\\r\\nto his old position. It seemed to her that he was looking fixedly at\\r\\nher, and was conscious of her gaze on him. She knew, in a flash, who the\\r\\nman was who was watching them. She drew the curtain abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDenham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Rodney. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe was there last night too.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He spoke sternly.\\r\\nHis whole manner had become full of authority. Katharine felt almost\\r\\nas if he accused her of some crime. She was pale and uncomfortably\\r\\nagitated, as much by the strangeness of RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s behavior as by the\\r\\nsight of Ralph Denham.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf he chooses to come--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said defiantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t let him wait out there. I shall tell him to come in.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney\\r\\nspoke with such decision that when he raised his arm Katharine expected\\r\\nhim to draw the curtain instantly. She caught his hand with a little\\r\\nexclamation.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWait!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she cried. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t allow you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t wait,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve gone too far.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d His hand remained\\r\\nupon the curtain. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you admit, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he broke out,\\r\\nlooking at her with an expression of contempt as well as of anger, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthat\\r\\nyou love him? Are you going to treat him as you treated me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him, wondering, in spite of all her perplexity, at the\\r\\nspirit that possessed him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI forbid you to draw the curtain,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe reflected, and then took his hand away.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve no right to interfere,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he concluded. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll leave you. Or, if you\\r\\nlike, weÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll go back to the drawing-room.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t go back,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, shaking her head. She bent her head in\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou love him, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney said suddenly. His tone had lost\\r\\nsomething of its sternness, and might have been used to urge a child to\\r\\nconfess its fault. She raised her eyes and fixed them upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI love him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she repeated. He nodded. She searched his face, as if\\r\\nfor further confirmation of his words, and, as he remained silent and\\r\\nexpectant, turned away once more and continued her thoughts. He observed\\r\\nher closely, but without stirring, as if he gave her time to make up her\\r\\nmind to fulfil her obvious duty. The strains of Mozart reached them from\\r\\nthe room above.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said suddenly, with a sort of desperation, rising from her\\r\\nchair and seeming to command Rodney to fulfil his part. He drew the\\r\\ncurtain instantly, and she made no attempt to stop him. Their eyes at\\r\\nonce sought the same spot beneath the lamp-post.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not there!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one was there. William threw the window up and looked out. The\\r\\nwind rushed into the room, together with the sound of distant wheels,\\r\\nfootsteps hurrying along the pavement, and the cries of sirens hooting\\r\\ndown the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDenham!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRalph!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, but she spoke scarcely louder than she might\\r\\nhave spoken to some one in the same room. With their eyes fixed upon\\r\\nthe opposite side of the road, they did not notice a figure close to the\\r\\nrailing which divided the garden from the street. But Denham had crossed\\r\\nthe road and was standing there. They were startled by his voice close\\r\\nat hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRodney!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere you are! Come in, Denham.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney went to the front door and\\r\\nopened it. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHere he is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, bringing Ralph with him into the\\r\\ndining-room where Katharine stood, with her back to the open window.\\r\\nTheir eyes met for a second. Denham looked half dazed by the strong\\r\\nlight, and, buttoned in his overcoat, with his hair ruffled across his\\r\\nforehead by the wind, he seemed like somebody rescued from an open boat\\r\\nout at sea. William promptly shut the window and drew the curtains. He\\r\\nacted with a cheerful decision as if he were master of the situation,\\r\\nand knew exactly what he meant to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re the first to hear the news, Denham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ngoing to marry me, after all.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhere shall I put--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph began vaguely, holding out his hat and\\r\\nglancing about him; he balanced it carefully against a silver bowl that\\r\\nstood upon the sideboard. He then sat himself down rather heavily at\\r\\nthe head of the oval dinner-table. Rodney stood on one side of him and\\r\\nKatharine on the other. He appeared to be presiding over some meeting\\r\\nfrom which most of the members were absent. Meanwhile, he waited, and\\r\\nhis eyes rested upon the glow of the beautifully polished mahogany\\r\\ntable.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWilliam is engaged to Cassandra,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine briefly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that Denham looked up quickly at Rodney. RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s expression changed.\\r\\nHe lost his self-possession. He smiled a little nervously, and then his\\r\\nattention seemed to be caught by a fragment of melody from the floor\\r\\nabove. He seemed for a moment to forget the presence of the others. He\\r\\nglanced towards the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI congratulate you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Denham.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, yes. WeÃ¢\\x80\\x99re all mad--quite out of our minds, Denham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s partly KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s doing--partly mine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He looked oddly round the\\r\\nroom as if he wished to make sure that the scene in which he played\\r\\na part had some real existence. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cQuite mad,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cEven\\r\\nKatharine--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d His gaze rested upon her finally, as if she, too, had\\r\\nchanged from his old view of her. He smiled at her as if to encourage\\r\\nher. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine shall explain,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, and giving a little nod to\\r\\nDenham, he left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine sat down at once, and leant her chin upon her hands. So long\\r\\nas Rodney was in the room the proceedings of the evening had seemed to\\r\\nbe in his charge, and had been marked by a certain unreality. Now that\\r\\nshe was alone with Ralph she felt at once that a constraint had been\\r\\ntaken from them both. She felt that they were alone at the bottom of the\\r\\nhouse, which rose, story upon story, upon the top of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy were you waiting out there?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFor the chance of seeing you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou would have waited all night if it hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t been for William. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwindy too. You must have been cold. What could you see? Nothing but our\\r\\nwindows.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt was worth it. I heard you call me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI called you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She had called unconsciously.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey were engaged this morning,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she told him, after a pause.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re glad?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe bent her head. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes, yes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she sighed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know how good\\r\\nhe is--what heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s done for me--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph made a sound of understanding.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou waited there last night too?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. I can wait,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Denham replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words seemed to fill the room with an emotion which Katharine\\r\\nconnected with the sound of distant wheels, the footsteps hurrying along\\r\\nthe pavement, the cries of sirens hooting down the river, the darkness\\r\\nand the wind. She saw the upright figure standing beneath the lamp-post.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWaiting in the dark,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, glancing at the window, as if he saw\\r\\nwhat she was seeing. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAh, but itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s different--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She broke off. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not\\r\\nthe person you think me. Until you realize that itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s impossible--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPlacing her elbows on the table, she slid her ruby ring up and down\\r\\nher finger abstractedly. She frowned at the rows of leather-bound\\r\\nbooks opposite her. Ralph looked keenly at her. Very pale, but sternly\\r\\nconcentrated upon her meaning, beautiful but so little aware of herself\\r\\nas to seem remote from him also, there was something distant and\\r\\nabstract about her which exalted him and chilled him at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know you. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve never known you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYet perhaps you know me better than any one else,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she mused.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome detached instinct made her aware that she was gazing at a book\\r\\nwhich belonged by rights to some other part of the house. She walked\\r\\nover to the shelf, took it down, and returned to her seat, placing\\r\\nthe book on the table between them. Ralph opened it and looked at the\\r\\nportrait of a man with a voluminous white shirt-collar, which formed the\\r\\nfrontispiece.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI say I do know you, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he affirmed, shutting the book. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nonly for moments that I go mad.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you call two whole nights a moment?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI swear to you that now, at this instant, I see you precisely as you\\r\\nare. No one has ever known you as I know you.... Could you have taken\\r\\ndown that book just now if I hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t known you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s true,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbut you canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think how IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m divided--how\\r\\nIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m at my ease with you, and how IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m bewildered. The unreality--the\\r\\ndark--the waiting outside in the wind--yes, when you look at me, not\\r\\nseeing me, and I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see you either.... But I do see,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went on\\r\\nquickly, changing her position and frowning again, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cheaps of things,\\r\\nonly not you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTell me what you see,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he urged.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she could not reduce her vision to words, since it was no single\\r\\nshape colored upon the dark, but rather a general excitement, an\\r\\natmosphere, which, when she tried to visualize it, took form as a wind\\r\\nscouring the flanks of northern hills and flashing light upon cornfields\\r\\nand pools.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cImpossible,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she sighed, laughing at the ridiculous notion of putting\\r\\nany part of this into words.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTry, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph urged her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t--IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m talking a sort of nonsense--the sort of nonsense one\\r\\ntalks to oneself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She was dismayed by the expression of longing and\\r\\ndespair upon his face. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI was thinking about a mountain in the North of\\r\\nEngland,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she attempted. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s too silly--I wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t go on.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe were there together?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he pressed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. I was alone.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She seemed to be disappointing the desire of a child.\\r\\nHis face fell.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re always alone there?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t explain.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She could not explain that she was essentially\\r\\nalone there. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not a mountain in the North of England. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s an\\r\\nimagination--a story one tells oneself. You have yours too?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re with me in mine. YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re the thing I make up, you see.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, I see,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she sighed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s why itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s so impossible.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She turned\\r\\nupon him almost fiercely. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou must try to stop it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied roughly, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cbecause I--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He stopped. He realized\\r\\nthat the moment had come to impart that news of the utmost importance\\r\\nwhich he had tried to impart to Mary Datchet, to Rodney upon the\\r\\nEmbankment, to the drunken tramp upon the seat. How should he offer it\\r\\nto Katharine? He looked quickly at her. He saw that she was only half\\r\\nattentive to him; only a section of her was exposed to him. The sight\\r\\nroused in him such desperation that he had much ado to control his\\r\\nimpulse to rise and leave the house. Her hand lay loosely curled upon\\r\\nthe table. He seized it and grasped it firmly as if to make sure of her\\r\\nexistence and of his own. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBecause I love you, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome roundness or warmth essential to that statement was absent from\\r\\nhis voice, and she had merely to shake her head very slightly for him\\r\\nto drop her hand and turn away in shame at his own impotence. He thought\\r\\nthat she had detected his wish to leave her. She had discerned the break\\r\\nin his resolution, the blankness in the heart of his vision. It was true\\r\\nthat he had been happier out in the street, thinking of her, than now\\r\\nthat he was in the same room with her. He looked at her with a guilty\\r\\nexpression on his face. But her look expressed neither disappointment\\r\\nnor reproach. Her pose was easy, and she seemed to give effect to a mood\\r\\nof quiet speculation by the spinning of her ruby ring upon the polished\\r\\ntable. Denham forgot his despair in wondering what thoughts now occupied\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. His tone was humble, and made her smile\\r\\nat him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs far as I understand you--but what should you advise me to do with\\r\\nthis ring?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked, holding it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should advise you to let me keep it for you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied, in the same\\r\\ntone of half-humorous gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAfter what youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve said, I can hardly trust you--unless youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll unsay\\r\\nwhat youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve said?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery well. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not in love with you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut I think you ARE in love with me.... As I am with you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added\\r\\ncasually enough. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAt least,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said slipping her ring back to its old\\r\\nposition, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhat other word describes the state weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re in?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at him gravely and inquiringly, as if in search of help.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s when IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m with you that I doubt it, not when IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m alone,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he stated.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo I thought,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to explain to her his state of mind, Ralph recounted his\\r\\nexperience with the photograph, the letter, and the flower picked at\\r\\nKew. She listened very seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd then you went raving about the streets,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she mused. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWell, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s bad\\r\\nenough. But my state is worse than yours, because it hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t anything\\r\\nto do with facts. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s an hallucination, pure and simple--an\\r\\nintoxication.... One can be in love with pure reason?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she hazarded.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause if youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re in love with a vision, I believe that thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m\\r\\nin love with.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis conclusion seemed fantastic and profoundly unsatisfactory to Ralph,\\r\\nbut after the astonishing variations of his own sentiments during the\\r\\npast half-hour he could not accuse her of fanciful exaggeration.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRodney seems to know his own mind well enough,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said almost\\r\\nbitterly. The music, which had ceased, had now begun again, and the\\r\\nmelody of Mozart seemed to express the easy and exquisite love of the\\r\\ntwo upstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCassandra never doubted for a moment. But we--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she glanced at him as\\r\\nif to ascertain his position, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe see each other only now and then--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLike lights in a storm--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIn the midst of a hurricane,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she concluded, as the window shook\\r\\nbeneath the pressure of the wind. They listened to the sound in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the door opened with considerable hesitation, and Mrs. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhead appeared, at first with an air of caution, but having made sure\\r\\nthat she had admitted herself to the dining-room and not to some more\\r\\nunusual region, she came completely inside and seemed in no way taken\\r\\naback by the sight she saw. She seemed, as usual, bound on some quest of\\r\\nher own which was interrupted pleasantly but strangely by running into\\r\\none of those queer, unnecessary ceremonies that other people thought fit\\r\\nto indulge in.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPlease donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t let me interrupt you, Mr.--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she was at a loss, as usual,\\r\\nfor the name, and Katharine thought that she did not recognize him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nhope youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve found something nice to read,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, pointing to the\\r\\nbook upon the table. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cByron--ah, Byron. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve known people who knew Lord\\r\\nByron,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine, who had risen in some confusion, could not help smiling at\\r\\nthe thought that her mother found it perfectly natural and desirable\\r\\nthat her daughter should be reading Byron in the dining-room late at\\r\\nnight alone with a strange young man. She blessed a disposition that\\r\\nwas so convenient, and felt tenderly towards her mother and her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\neccentricities. But Ralph observed that although Mrs. Hilbery held the\\r\\nbook so close to her eyes she was not reading a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear mother, why arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you in bed?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine exclaimed, changing\\r\\nastonishingly in the space of a minute to her usual condition of\\r\\nauthoritative good sense. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy are you wandering about?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure I should like your poetry better than I like Lord ByronÃ¢\\x80\\x99s,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n said Mrs. Hilbery, addressing Ralph Denham.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Denham doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t write poetry; he has written articles for father,\\r\\nfor the Review,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine said, as if prompting her memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh dear! How dull!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed, with a sudden laugh that\\r\\nrather puzzled her daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph found that she had turned upon him a gaze that was at once very\\r\\nvague and very penetrating.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure you read poetry at night. I always judge by the expression\\r\\nof the eyes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery continued. (Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe windows of the soul,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nadded parenthetically.) Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know much about the law,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she went\\r\\non, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthough many of my relations were lawyers. Some of them looked\\r\\nvery handsome, too, in their wigs. But I think I do know a little\\r\\nabout poetry,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnd all the things that arenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t written\\r\\ndown, but--but--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She waved her hand, as if to indicate the wealth of\\r\\nunwritten poetry all about them. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe night and the stars, the dawn\\r\\ncoming up, the barges swimming past, the sun setting.... Ah dear,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nsighed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwell, the sunset is very lovely too. I sometimes think that\\r\\npoetry isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t so much what we write as what we feel, Mr. Denham.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this speech of her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Katharine had turned away, and\\r\\nRalph felt that Mrs. Hilbery was talking to him apart, with a desire\\r\\nto ascertain something about him which she veiled purposely by the\\r\\nvagueness of her words. He felt curiously encouraged and heartened by\\r\\nthe beam in her eye rather than by her actual words. From the distance\\r\\nof her age and sex she seemed to be waving to him, hailing him as a ship\\r\\nsinking beneath the horizon might wave its flag of greeting to another\\r\\nsetting out upon the same voyage. He bent his head, saying nothing, but\\r\\nwith a curious certainty that she had read an answer to her inquiry that\\r\\nsatisfied her. At any rate, she rambled off into a description of the\\r\\nLaw Courts which turned to a denunciation of English justice, which,\\r\\naccording to her, imprisoned poor men who couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t pay their debts.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTell me, shall we ever do without it all?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked, but at this point\\r\\nKatharine gently insisted that her mother should go to bed. Looking back\\r\\nfrom half-way up the staircase, Katharine seemed to see DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eyes\\r\\nwatching her steadily and intently with an expression that she had\\r\\nguessed in them when he stood looking at the windows across the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXI\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tray which brought KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s cup of tea the next morning brought,\\r\\nalso, a note from her mother, announcing that it was her intention to\\r\\ncatch an early train to Stratford-on-Avon that very day.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPlease find out the best way of getting there,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the note ran, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand wire\\r\\nto dear Sir John Burdett to expect me, with my love. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been dreaming\\r\\nall night of you and Shakespeare, dearest Katharine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was no momentary impulse. Mrs. Hilbery had been dreaming of\\r\\nShakespeare any time these six months, toying with the idea of an\\r\\nexcursion to what she considered the heart of the civilized world. To\\r\\nstand six feet above ShakespeareÃ¢\\x80\\x99s bones, to see the very stones worn by\\r\\nhis feet, to reflect that the oldest manÃ¢\\x80\\x99s oldest mother had very likely\\r\\nseen ShakespeareÃ¢\\x80\\x99s daughter--such thoughts roused an emotion in her,\\r\\nwhich she expressed at unsuitable moments, and with a passion that would\\r\\nnot have been unseemly in a pilgrim to a sacred shrine. The only strange\\r\\nthing was that she wished to go by herself. But, naturally enough,\\r\\nshe was well provided with friends who lived in the neighborhood of\\r\\nShakespeareÃ¢\\x80\\x99s tomb, and were delighted to welcome her; and she left\\r\\nlater to catch her train in the best of spirits. There was a man selling\\r\\nviolets in the street. It was a fine day. She would remember to send Mr.\\r\\nHilbery the first daffodil she saw. And, as she ran back into the hall\\r\\nto tell Katharine, she felt, she had always felt, that ShakespeareÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncommand to leave his bones undisturbed applied only to odious\\r\\ncuriosity-mongers--not to dear Sir John and herself. Leaving her\\r\\ndaughter to cogitate the theory of Anne HathawayÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sonnets, and the\\r\\nburied manuscripts here referred to, with the implied menace to the\\r\\nsafety of the heart of civilization itself, she briskly shut the door\\r\\nof her taxi-cab, and was whirled off upon the first stage of her\\r\\npilgrimage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was oddly different without her. Katharine found the maids\\r\\nalready in possession of her room, which they meant to clean thoroughly\\r\\nduring her absence. To Katharine it seemed as if they had brushed away\\r\\nsixty years or so with the first flick of their damp dusters. It seemed\\r\\nto her that the work she had tried to do in that room was being swept\\r\\ninto a very insignificant heap of dust. The china shepherdesses were\\r\\nalready shining from a bath of hot water. The writing-table might have\\r\\nbelonged to a professional man of methodical habits.\\r\\n\\r\\nGathering together a few papers upon which she was at work, Katharine\\r\\nproceeded to her own room with the intention of looking through them,\\r\\nperhaps, in the course of the morning. But she was met on the stairs\\r\\nby Cassandra, who followed her up, but with such intervals between each\\r\\nstep that Katharine began to feel her purpose dwindling before they had\\r\\nreached the door. Cassandra leant over the banisters, and looked down\\r\\nupon the Persian rug that lay on the floor of the hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDoesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t everything look odd this morning?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she inquired. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAre you\\r\\nreally going to spend the morning with those dull old letters, because\\r\\nif so--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dull old letters, which would have turned the heads of the most\\r\\nsober of collectors, were laid upon a table, and, after a momentÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npause, Cassandra, looking grave all of a sudden, asked Katharine where\\r\\nshe should find the Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHistory of EnglandÃ¢\\x80\\x9d by Lord Macaulay. It was\\r\\ndownstairs in Mr. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s study. The cousins descended together in\\r\\nsearch of it. They diverged into the drawing-room for the good reason\\r\\nthat the door was open. The portrait of Richard Alardyce attracted their\\r\\nattention.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wonder what he was like?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d It was a question that Katharine had often\\r\\nasked herself lately.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, a fraud like the rest of them--at least Henry says so,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra\\r\\nreplied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThough I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t believe everything Henry says,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added a\\r\\nlittle defensively.\\r\\n\\r\\nDown they went into Mr. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s study, where they began to look among\\r\\nhis books. So desultory was this examination that some fifteen minutes\\r\\nfailed to discover the work they were in search of.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMust you read MacaulayÃ¢\\x80\\x99s History, Cassandra?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine asked, with a\\r\\nstretch of her arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI must,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra replied briefly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m going to leave you to look for it by yourself.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, no, Katharine. Please stay and help me. You see--you see--I told\\r\\nWilliam IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d read a little every day. And I want to tell him that IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve\\r\\nbegun when he comes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhen does William come?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine asked, turning to the shelves again.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTo tea, if that suits you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf it suits me to be out, I suppose you mean.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re horrid.... Why shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you--?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you be happy too?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am quite happy,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI mean as I am. Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said impulsively, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdo letÃ¢\\x80\\x99s be married\\r\\non the same day.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTo the same man?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, no, no. But why shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you marry--some one else?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s your Macaulay,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, turning round with the book in\\r\\nher hand. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should say youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d better begin to read at once if you mean\\r\\nto be educated by tea-time.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDamn Lord Macaulay!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d cried Cassandra, slapping the book upon the table.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWould you rather not talk?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWeÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve talked enough already,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied evasively.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI know I shanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be able to settle to Macaulay,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Cassandra, looking\\r\\nruefully at the dull red cover of the prescribed volume, which, however,\\r\\npossessed a talismanic property, since William admired it. He had\\r\\nadvised a little serious reading for the morning hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave YOU read Macaulay?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. William never tried to educate me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d As she spoke she saw the light\\r\\nfade from CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s face, as if she had implied some other, more\\r\\nmysterious, relationship. She was stung with compunction. She marveled\\r\\nat her own rashness in having influenced the life of another, as she had\\r\\ninfluenced CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s life.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe werenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t serious,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m fearfully serious,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Cassandra, with a little shudder,\\r\\nand her look showed that she spoke the truth. She turned and glanced at\\r\\nKatharine as she had never glanced at her before. There was fear in her\\r\\nglance, which darted on her and then dropped guiltily. Oh, Katharine\\r\\nhad everything--beauty, mind, character. She could never compete with\\r\\nKatharine; she could never be safe so long as Katharine brooded over\\r\\nher, dominating her, disposing of her. She called her cold, unseeing,\\r\\nunscrupulous, but the only sign she gave outwardly was a curious\\r\\none--she reached out her hand and grasped the volume of history. At that\\r\\nmoment the bell of the telephone rang and Katharine went to answer it.\\r\\nCassandra, released from observation, dropped her book and clenched her\\r\\nhands. She suffered more fiery torture in those few minutes than she had\\r\\nsuffered in the whole of her life; she learnt more of her capacities for\\r\\nfeeling. But when Katharine reappeared she was calm, and had gained a\\r\\nlook of dignity that was new to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWas that him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt was Ralph Denham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI meant Ralph Denham.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy did you mean Ralph Denham? What has William told you about\\r\\nRalph Denham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The accusation that Katharine was calm, callous, and\\r\\nindifferent was not possible in face of her present air of animation.\\r\\nShe gave Cassandra no time to frame an answer. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNow, when are you and\\r\\nWilliam going to be married?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra made no reply for some moments. It was, indeed, a very\\r\\ndifficult question to answer. In conversation the night before, William\\r\\nhad indicated to Cassandra that, in his belief, Katharine was becoming\\r\\nengaged to Ralph Denham in the dining-room. Cassandra, in the rosy light\\r\\nof her own circumstances, had been disposed to think that the matter\\r\\nmust be settled already. But a letter which she had received that\\r\\nmorning from William, while ardent in its expression of affection, had\\r\\nconveyed to her obliquely that he would prefer the announcement of their\\r\\nengagement to coincide with that of KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s. This document Cassandra\\r\\nnow produced, and read aloud, with considerable excisions and much\\r\\nhesitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9c... a thousand pities--ahem--I fear we shall cause a great deal of\\r\\nnatural annoyance. If, on the other hand, what I have reason to think\\r\\nwill happen, should happen--within reasonable time, and the present\\r\\nposition is not in any way offensive to you, delay would, in my opinion,\\r\\nserve all our interests better than a premature explanation, which is\\r\\nbound to cause more surprise than is desirable--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery like William,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine exclaimed, having gathered the drift of\\r\\nthese remarks with a speed that, by itself, disconcerted Cassandra.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI quite understand his feelings,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI quite agree\\r\\nwith them. I think it would be much better, if you intend to marry Mr.\\r\\nDenham, that we should wait as William says.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut, then, if I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t marry him for months--or, perhaps, not at all?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra was silent. The prospect appalled her. Katharine had been\\r\\ntelephoning to Ralph Denham; she looked queer, too; she must be, or\\r\\nabout to become, engaged to him. But if Cassandra could have overheard\\r\\nthe conversation upon the telephone, she would not have felt so certain\\r\\nthat it tended in that direction. It was to this effect:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m Ralph Denham speaking. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m in my right senses now.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow long did you wait outside the house?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI went home and wrote you a letter. I tore it up.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI shall tear up everything too.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI shall come.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. Come to-day.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI must explain to you--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. We must explain--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA long pause followed. Ralph began a sentence, which he canceled with\\r\\nthe word, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNothing.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Suddenly, together, at the same moment, they said\\r\\ngood-bye. And yet, if the telephone had been miraculously connected with\\r\\nsome higher atmosphere pungent with the scent of thyme and the savor\\r\\nof salt, Katharine could hardly have breathed in a keener sense of\\r\\nexhilaration. She ran downstairs on the crest of it. She was amazed to\\r\\nfind herself already committed by William and Cassandra to marry the\\r\\nowner of the halting voice she had just heard on the telephone.\\r\\nThe tendency of her spirit seemed to be in an altogether different\\r\\ndirection; and of a different nature. She had only to look at Cassandra\\r\\nto see what the love that results in an engagement and marriage means.\\r\\nShe considered for a moment, and then said: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf you donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to tell\\r\\npeople yourselves, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll do it for you. I know William has feelings about\\r\\nthese matters that make it very difficult for him to do anything.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s fearfully sensitive about other peopleÃ¢\\x80\\x99s feelings,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nCassandra. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe idea that he could upset Aunt Maggie or Uncle Trevor\\r\\nwould make him ill for weeks.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis interpretation of what she was used to call WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nconventionality was new to Katharine. And yet she felt it now to be the\\r\\ntrue one.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd then he worships beauty. He wants life to be beautiful in\\r\\nevery part of it. Have you ever noticed how exquisitely he finishes\\r\\neverything? Look at the address on that envelope. Every letter is\\r\\nperfect.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether this applied also to the sentiments expressed in the letter,\\r\\nKatharine was not so sure; but when WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s solicitude was spent upon\\r\\nCassandra it not only failed to irritate her, as it had done when she\\r\\nwas the object of it, but appeared, as Cassandra said, the fruit of his\\r\\nlove of beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9che loves beauty.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI hope we shall have a great many children,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Cassandra. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe loves\\r\\nchildren.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis remark made Katharine realize the depths of their intimacy better\\r\\nthan any other words could have done; she was jealous for one moment;\\r\\nbut the next she was humiliated. She had known William for years, and\\r\\nshe had never once guessed that he loved children. She looked at the\\r\\nqueer glow of exaltation in CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eyes, through which she was\\r\\nbeholding the true spirit of a human being, and wished that she would\\r\\ngo on talking about William for ever. Cassandra was not unwilling to\\r\\ngratify her. She talked on. The morning slipped away. Katharine scarcely\\r\\nchanged her position on the edge of her fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s writing-table, and\\r\\nCassandra never opened the Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHistory of England.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet it must be confessed that there were vast lapses in the\\r\\nattention which Katharine bestowed upon her cousin. The atmosphere\\r\\nwas wonderfully congenial for thoughts of her own. She lost herself\\r\\nsometimes in such deep reverie that Cassandra, pausing, could look at\\r\\nher for moments unperceived. What could Katharine be thinking about,\\r\\nunless it were Ralph Denham? She was satisfied, by certain random\\r\\nreplies, that Katharine had wandered a little from the subject of\\r\\nWilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s perfections. But Katharine made no sign. She always ended\\r\\nthese pauses by saying something so natural that Cassandra was deluded\\r\\ninto giving fresh examples of her absorbing theme. Then they lunched,\\r\\nand the only sign that Katharine gave of abstraction was to forget\\r\\nto help the pudding. She looked so like her mother, as she sat there\\r\\noblivious of the tapioca, that Cassandra was startled into exclaiming:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHow like Aunt Maggie you look!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNonsense,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, with more irritation than the remark seemed\\r\\nto call for.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn truth, now that her mother was away, Katharine did feel less sensible\\r\\nthan usual, but as she argued it to herself, there was much less need\\r\\nfor sense. Secretly, she was a little shaken by the evidence which the\\r\\nmorning had supplied of her immense capacity for--what could one call\\r\\nit?--rambling over an infinite variety of thoughts that were too foolish\\r\\nto be named. She was, for example, walking down a road in Northumberland\\r\\nin the August sunset; at the inn she left her companion, who was Ralph\\r\\nDenham, and was transported, not so much by her own feet as by some\\r\\ninvisible means, to the top of a high hill. Here the scents, the sounds\\r\\namong the dry heather-roots, the grass-blades pressed upon the palm of\\r\\nher hand, were all so perceptible that she could experience each one\\r\\nseparately. After this her mind made excursions into the dark of the\\r\\nair, or settled upon the surface of the sea, which could be discovered\\r\\nover there, or with equal unreason it returned to its couch of bracken\\r\\nbeneath the stars of midnight, and visited the snow valleys of the moon.\\r\\nThese fancies would have been in no way strange, since the walls of\\r\\nevery mind are decorated with some such tracery, but she found herself\\r\\nsuddenly pursuing such thoughts with an extreme ardor, which became\\r\\na desire to change her actual condition for something matching the\\r\\nconditions of her dream. Then she started; then she awoke to the fact\\r\\nthat Cassandra was looking at her in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra would have liked to feel certain that, when Katharine made no\\r\\nreply at all or one wide of the mark, she was making up her mind to get\\r\\nmarried at once, but it was difficult, if this were so, to account for\\r\\nsome remarks that Katharine let fall about the future. She recurred\\r\\nseveral times to the summer, as if she meant to spend that season in\\r\\nsolitary wandering. She seemed to have a plan in her mind which required\\r\\nBradshaws and the names of inns.\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra was driven finally, by her own unrest, to put on her clothes\\r\\nand wander out along the streets of Chelsea, on the pretence that\\r\\nshe must buy something. But, in her ignorance of the way, she became\\r\\npanic-stricken at the thought of being late, and no sooner had she found\\r\\nthe shop she wanted, than she fled back again in order to be at home\\r\\nwhen William came. He came, indeed, five minutes after she had sat down\\r\\nby the tea-table, and she had the happiness of receiving him alone. His\\r\\ngreeting put her doubts of his affection at rest, but the first question\\r\\nhe asked was:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHas Katharine spoken to you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. But she says sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not engaged. She doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t seem to think sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\never going to be engaged.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam frowned, and looked annoyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThey telephoned this morning, and she behaves very oddly. She forgets\\r\\nto help the pudding,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra added by way of cheering him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear child, after what I saw and heard last night, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not a\\r\\nquestion of guessing or suspecting. Either sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s engaged to him--or--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe left his sentence unfinished, for at this point Katharine herself\\r\\nappeared. With his recollections of the scene the night before, he was\\r\\ntoo self-conscious even to look at her, and it was not until she told\\r\\nhim of her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s visit to Stratford-on-Avon that he raised his eyes.\\r\\nIt was clear that he was greatly relieved. He looked round him now, as\\r\\nif he felt at his ease, and Cassandra exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you think everything looks quite different?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve moved the sofa?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. NothingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s been touched,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cEverythingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s exactly the\\r\\nsame.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d But as she said this, with a decision which seemed to make it\\r\\nimply that more than the sofa was unchanged, she held out a cup\\r\\ninto which she had forgotten to pour any tea. Being told of her\\r\\nforgetfulness, she frowned with annoyance, and said that Cassandra was\\r\\ndemoralizing her. The glance she cast upon them, and the resolute way in\\r\\nwhich she plunged them into speech, made William and Cassandra feel\\r\\nlike children who had been caught prying. They followed her obediently,\\r\\nmaking conversation. Any one coming in might have judged them\\r\\nacquaintances met, perhaps, for the third time. If that were so, one\\r\\nmust have concluded that the hostess suddenly bethought her of an\\r\\nengagement pressing for fulfilment. First Katharine looked at her watch,\\r\\nand then she asked William to tell her the right time. When told that it\\r\\nwas ten minutes to five she rose at once, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid I must go.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe left the room, holding her unfinished bread and butter in her hand.\\r\\nWilliam glanced at Cassandra.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, she IS queer!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam looked perturbed. He knew more of Katharine than Cassandra\\r\\ndid, but even he could not tell--. In a second Katharine was back again\\r\\ndressed in outdoor things, still holding her bread and butter in her\\r\\nbare hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m late, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t wait for me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI shall have dined,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and so\\r\\nsaying, she left them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut she canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William exclaimed, as the door shut, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cnot without any\\r\\ngloves and bread and butter in her hand!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d They ran to the window, and\\r\\nsaw her walking rapidly along the street towards the City. Then she\\r\\nvanished.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe must have gone to meet Mr. Denham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGoodness knows!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d William interjected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe incident impressed them both as having something queer and ominous\\r\\nabout it out of all proportion to its surface strangeness.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the sort of way Aunt Maggie behaves,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Cassandra, as if in\\r\\nexplanation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam shook his head, and paced up and down the room looking extremely\\r\\nperturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is what IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been foretelling,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he burst out. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOnce set the\\r\\nordinary conventions aside--Thank Heaven Mrs. Hilbery is away. But\\r\\nthereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Mr. Hilbery. How are we to explain it to him? I shall have to\\r\\nleave you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut Uncle Trevor wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be back for hours, William!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra implored.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou never can tell. He may be on his way already. Or suppose Mrs.\\r\\nMilvain--your Aunt Celia--or Mrs. Cosham, or any other of your aunts\\r\\nor uncles should be shown in and find us alone together. You know what\\r\\ntheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re saying about us already.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra was equally stricken by the sight of WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s agitation, and\\r\\nappalled by the prospect of his desertion.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe might hide,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed wildly, glancing at the curtain which\\r\\nseparated the room with the relics.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI refuse entirely to get under the table,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said William sarcastically.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe saw that he was losing his temper with the difficulties of the\\r\\nsituation. Her instinct told her that an appeal to his affection, at\\r\\nthis moment, would be extremely ill-judged. She controlled herself, sat\\r\\ndown, poured out a fresh cup of tea, and sipped it quietly. This natural\\r\\naction, arguing complete self-mastery, and showing her in one of those\\r\\nfeminine attitudes which William found adorable, did more than any\\r\\nargument to compose his agitation. It appealed to his chivalry. He\\r\\naccepted a cup. Next she asked for a slice of cake. By the time the cake\\r\\nwas eaten and the tea drunk the personal question had lapsed, and they\\r\\nwere discussing poetry. Insensibly they turned from the question of\\r\\ndramatic poetry in general, to the particular example which reposed\\r\\nin WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s pocket, and when the maid came in to clear away the\\r\\ntea-things, William had asked permission to read a short passage aloud,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cunless it bored her?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra bent her head in silence, but she showed a little of what she\\r\\nfelt in her eyes, and thus fortified, William felt confident that it\\r\\nwould take more than Mrs. Milvain herself to rout him from his position.\\r\\nHe read aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Katharine walked rapidly along the street. If called upon to\\r\\nexplain her impulsive action in leaving the tea-table, she could have\\r\\ntraced it to no better cause than that William had glanced at Cassandra;\\r\\nCassandra at William. Yet, because they had glanced, her position was\\r\\nimpossible. If one forgot to pour out a cup of tea they rushed to the\\r\\nconclusion that she was engaged to Ralph Denham. She knew that in half\\r\\nan hour or so the door would open, and Ralph Denham would appear.\\r\\nShe could not sit there and contemplate seeing him with WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s and\\r\\nCassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eyes upon them, judging their exact degree of intimacy, so\\r\\nthat they might fix the wedding-day. She promptly decided that she\\r\\nwould meet Ralph out of doors; she still had time to reach LincolnÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Inn\\r\\nFields before he left his office. She hailed a cab, and bade it take her\\r\\nto a shop for selling maps which she remembered in Great Queen Street,\\r\\nsince she hardly liked to be set down at his door. Arrived at the shop,\\r\\nshe bought a large scale map of Norfolk, and thus provided, hurried into\\r\\nLincolnÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Inn Fields, and assured herself of the position of Messrs.\\r\\nHoper and GrateleyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s office. The great gas chandeliers were alight in\\r\\nthe office windows. She conceived that he sat at an enormous table laden\\r\\nwith papers beneath one of them in the front room with the three tall\\r\\nwindows. Having settled his position there, she began walking to and fro\\r\\nupon the pavement. Nobody of his build appeared. She scrutinized each\\r\\nmale figure as it approached and passed her. Each male figure had,\\r\\nnevertheless, a look of him, due, perhaps, to the professional dress,\\r\\nthe quick step, the keen glance which they cast upon her as they\\r\\nhastened home after the dayÃ¢\\x80\\x99s work. The square itself, with its immense\\r\\nhouses all so fully occupied and stern of aspect, its atmosphere of\\r\\nindustry and power, as if even the sparrows and the children were\\r\\nearning their daily bread, as if the sky itself, with its gray and\\r\\nscarlet clouds, reflected the serious intention of the city beneath it,\\r\\nspoke of him. Here was the fit place for their meeting, she thought;\\r\\nhere was the fit place for her to walk thinking of him. She could\\r\\nnot help comparing it with the domestic streets of Chelsea. With this\\r\\ncomparison in her mind, she extended her range a little, and turned into\\r\\nthe main road. The great torrent of vans and carts was sweeping\\r\\ndown Kingsway; pedestrians were streaming in two currents along the\\r\\npavements. She stood fascinated at the corner. The deep roar filled her\\r\\nears; the changing tumult had the inexpressible fascination of varied\\r\\nlife pouring ceaselessly with a purpose which, as she looked, seemed to\\r\\nher, somehow, the normal purpose for which life was framed; its complete\\r\\nindifference to the individuals, whom it swallowed up and rolled\\r\\nonwards, filled her with at least a temporary exaltation. The blend of\\r\\ndaylight and of lamplight made her an invisible spectator, just as it\\r\\ngave the people who passed her a semi-transparent quality, and left the\\r\\nfaces pale ivory ovals in which the eyes alone were dark. They tended\\r\\nthe enormous rush of the current--the great flow, the deep stream, the\\r\\nunquenchable tide. She stood unobserved and absorbed, glorying openly\\r\\nin the rapture that had run subterraneously all day. Suddenly she\\r\\nwas clutched, unwilling, from the outside, by the recollection of her\\r\\npurpose in coming there. She had come to find Ralph Denham. She hastily\\r\\nturned back into LincolnÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Inn Fields, and looked for her landmark--the\\r\\nlight in the three tall windows. She sought in vain. The faces of the\\r\\nhouses had now merged in the general darkness, and she had difficulty in\\r\\ndetermining which she sought. RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s three windows gave back on their\\r\\nghostly glass panels only a reflection of the gray and greenish sky. She\\r\\nrang the bell, peremptorily, under the painted name of the firm. After\\r\\nsome delay she was answered by a caretaker, whose pail and brush of\\r\\nthemselves told her that the working day was over and the workers\\r\\ngone. Nobody, save perhaps Mr. Grateley himself, was left, she assured\\r\\nKatharine; every one else had been gone these ten minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe news woke Katharine completely. Anxiety gained upon her. She\\r\\nhastened back into Kingsway, looking at people who had miraculously\\r\\nregained their solidity. She ran as far as the Tube station, overhauling\\r\\nclerk after clerk, solicitor after solicitor. Not one of them even\\r\\nfaintly resembled Ralph Denham. More and more plainly did she see him;\\r\\nand more and more did he seem to her unlike any one else. At the door of\\r\\nthe station she paused, and tried to collect her thoughts. He had gone\\r\\nto her house. By taking a cab she could be there probably in advance of\\r\\nhim. But she pictured herself opening the drawing-room door, and William\\r\\nand Cassandra looking up, and RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s entrance a moment later, and the\\r\\nglances--the insinuations. No; she could not face it. She would write\\r\\nhim a letter and take it at once to his house. She bought paper and\\r\\npencil at the bookstall, and entered an A.B.C. shop, where, by ordering\\r\\na cup of coffee, she secured an empty table, and began at vice to write:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI came to meet you and I have missed you. I could not face William and\\r\\nCassandra. They want us--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d here she paused. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThey insist that we are\\r\\nengaged,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she substituted, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand we couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t talk at all, or explain\\r\\nanything. I want--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Her wants were so vast, now that she was in\\r\\ncommunication with Ralph, that the pencil was utterly inadequate to\\r\\nconduct them on to the paper; it seemed as if the whole torrent of\\r\\nKingsway had to run down her pencil. She gazed intently at a notice\\r\\nhanging on the gold-encrusted wall opposite, Ã¢\\x80\\x9c... to say all kinds of\\r\\nthings,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, writing each word with the painstaking of a child.\\r\\nBut, when she raised her eyes again to meditate the next sentence, she\\r\\nwas aware of a waitress, whose expression intimated that it was closing\\r\\ntime, and, looking round, Katharine saw herself almost the last person\\r\\nleft in the shop. She took up her letter, paid her bill, and found\\r\\nherself once more in the street. She would now take a cab to Highgate.\\r\\nBut at that moment it flashed upon her that she could not remember the\\r\\naddress. This check seemed to let fall a barrier across a very powerful\\r\\ncurrent of desire. She ransacked her memory in desperation, hunting\\r\\nfor the name, first by remembering the look of the house, and then by\\r\\ntrying, in memory, to retrace the words she had written once, at least,\\r\\nupon an envelope. The more she pressed the farther the words receded.\\r\\nWas the house an Orchard Something, on the street a Hill? She gave\\r\\nit up. Never, since she was a child, had she felt anything like this\\r\\nblankness and desolation. There rushed in upon her, as if she were\\r\\nwaking from some dream, all the consequences of her inexplicable\\r\\nindolence. She figured RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s face as he turned from her door without\\r\\na word of explanation, receiving his dismissal as a blow from herself,\\r\\na callous intimation that she did not wish to see him. She followed his\\r\\ndeparture from her door; but it was far more easy to see him marching\\r\\nfar and fast in any direction for any length of time than to conceive\\r\\nthat he would turn back to Highgate. Perhaps he would try once more to\\r\\nsee her in Cheyne Walk? It was proof of the clearness with which she saw\\r\\nhim, that she started forward as this possibility occurred to her, and\\r\\nalmost raised her hand to beckon to a cab. No; he was too proud to come\\r\\nagain; he rejected the desire and walked on and on, on and on--If\\r\\nonly she could read the names of those visionary streets down which he\\r\\npassed! But her imagination betrayed her at this point, or mocked her\\r\\nwith a sense of their strangeness, darkness, and distance. Indeed,\\r\\ninstead of helping herself to any decision, she only filled her mind\\r\\nwith the vast extent of London and the impossibility of finding any\\r\\nsingle figure that wandered off this way and that way, turned to the\\r\\nright and to the left, chose that dingy little back street where\\r\\nthe children were playing in the road, and so--She roused herself\\r\\nimpatiently. She walked rapidly along Holborn. Soon she turned and\\r\\nwalked as rapidly in the other direction. This indecision was not merely\\r\\nodious, but had something that alarmed her about it, as she had been\\r\\nalarmed slightly once or twice already that day; she felt unable to cope\\r\\nwith the strength of her own desires. To a person controlled by habit,\\r\\nthere was humiliation as well as alarm in this sudden release of what\\r\\nappeared to be a very powerful as well as an unreasonable force. An\\r\\naching in the muscles of her right hand now showed her that she was\\r\\ncrushing her gloves and the map of Norfolk in a grip sufficient to crack\\r\\na more solid object. She relaxed her grasp; she looked anxiously at the\\r\\nfaces of the passers-by to see whether their eyes rested on her for\\r\\na moment longer than was natural, or with any curiosity. But having\\r\\nsmoothed out her gloves, and done what she could to look as usual, she\\r\\nforgot spectators, and was once more given up to her desperate desire to\\r\\nfind Ralph Denham. It was a desire now--wild, irrational, unexplained,\\r\\nresembling something felt in childhood. Once more she blamed herself\\r\\nbitterly for her carelessness. But finding herself opposite the Tube\\r\\nstation, she pulled herself up and took counsel swiftly, as of old. It\\r\\nflashed upon her that she would go at once to Mary Datchet, and ask\\r\\nher to give her RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s address. The decision was a relief, not only in\\r\\ngiving her a goal, but in providing her with a rational excuse for her\\r\\nown actions. It gave her a goal certainly, but the fact of having a goal\\r\\nled her to dwell exclusively upon her obsession; so that when she rang\\r\\nthe bell of MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s flat, she did not for a moment consider how this\\r\\ndemand would strike Mary. To her extreme annoyance Mary was not at home;\\r\\na charwoman opened the door. All Katharine could do was to accept the\\r\\ninvitation to wait. She waited for, perhaps, fifteen minutes, and\\r\\nspent them in pacing from one end of the room to the other without\\r\\nintermission. When she heard MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s key in the door she paused in front\\r\\nof the fireplace, and Mary found her standing upright, looking at once\\r\\nexpectant and determined, like a person who has come on an errand of\\r\\nsuch importance that it must be broached without preface.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary exclaimed in surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, yes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine said, brushing these remarks aside, as if they\\r\\nwere in the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you had tea?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh yes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, thinking that she had had tea hundreds of years ago,\\r\\nsomewhere or other.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary paused, took off her gloves, and, finding matches, proceeded to\\r\\nlight the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine checked her with an impatient movement, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t light the fire for me.... I want to know Ralph DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s address.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was holding a pencil and preparing to write on the envelope. She\\r\\nwaited with an imperious expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe Apple Orchard, Mount Ararat Road, Highgate,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary said, speaking\\r\\nslowly and rather strangely.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, I remember now!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine exclaimed, with irritation at her own\\r\\nstupidity. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose it wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t take twenty minutes to drive there?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n She gathered up her purse and gloves and seemed about to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut you wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t find him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, pausing with a match in her hand.\\r\\nKatharine, who had already turned towards the door, stopped and looked\\r\\nat her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy? Where is he?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t have left his office.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut he has left the office,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe only question is will he\\r\\nhave reached home yet? He went to see me at Chelsea; I tried to meet him\\r\\nand missed him. He will have found no message to explain. So I must find\\r\\nhim--as soon as possible.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary took in the situation at her leisure.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut why not telephone?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine immediately dropped all that she was holding; her strained\\r\\nexpression relaxed, and exclaiming, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOf course! Why didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t I think\\r\\nof that!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she seized the telephone receiver and gave her number. Mary\\r\\nlooked at her steadily, and then left the room. At length Katharine\\r\\nheard, through all the superimposed weight of London, the mysterious\\r\\nsound of feet in her own house mounting to the little room, where she\\r\\ncould almost see the pictures and the books; she listened with extreme\\r\\nintentness to the preparatory vibrations, and then established her\\r\\nidentity.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHas Mr. Denham called?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, miss.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid he ask for me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. We said you were out, miss.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid he leave any message?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. He went away. About twenty minutes ago, miss.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine hung up the receiver. She walked the length of the room in\\r\\nsuch acute disappointment that she did not at first perceive MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nabsence. Then she called in a harsh and peremptory tone:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMary.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was taking off her outdoor things in the bedroom. She heard\\r\\nKatharine call her. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI shanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be a moment.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d But the\\r\\nmoment prolonged itself, as if for some reason Mary found satisfaction\\r\\nin making herself not only tidy, but seemly and ornamented. A stage in\\r\\nher life had been accomplished in the last months which left its traces\\r\\nfor ever upon her bearing. Youth, and the bloom of youth, had receded,\\r\\nleaving the purpose of her face to show itself in the hollower cheeks,\\r\\nthe firmer lips, the eyes no longer spontaneously observing at random,\\r\\nbut narrowed upon an end which was not near at hand. This woman was now\\r\\na serviceable human being, mistress of her own destiny, and thus, by\\r\\nsome combination of ideas, fit to be adorned with the dignity of silver\\r\\nchains and glowing brooches. She came in at her leisure and asked:\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, did you get an answer?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe has left Chelsea already,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cStill, he wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be home yet,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine was once more irresistibly drawn to gaze upon an imaginary map\\r\\nof London, to follow the twists and turns of unnamed streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll ring up his home and ask whether heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s back.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary crossed to the\\r\\ntelephone and, after a series of brief remarks, announced:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo. His sister says he hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t come back yet.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She applied her ear to the telephone once more. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTheyÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve had a\\r\\nmessage. He wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be back to dinner.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen what is he going to do?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nVery pale, and with her large eyes fixed not so much upon Mary as upon\\r\\nvistas of unresponding blankness, Katharine addressed herself also not\\r\\nso much to Mary as to the unrelenting spirit which now appeared to mock\\r\\nher from every quarter of her survey.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter waiting a little time Mary remarked indifferently:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI really donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Slackly lying back in her armchair, she watched\\r\\nthe little flames beginning to creep among the coals indifferently, as\\r\\nif they, too, were very distant and indifferent.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine looked at her indignantly and rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPossibly he may come here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary continued, without altering the\\r\\nabstract tone of her voice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIt would be worth your while to wait if\\r\\nyou want to see him to-night.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She bent forward and touched the wood, so\\r\\nthat the flames slipped in between the interstices of the coal.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine reflected. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll wait half an hour,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary rose, went to the table, spread out her papers under the\\r\\ngreen-shaded lamp and, with an action that was becoming a habit,\\r\\ntwisted a lock of hair round and round in her fingers. Once she looked\\r\\nunperceived at her visitor, who never moved, who sat so still, with eyes\\r\\nso intent, that you could almost fancy that she was watching something,\\r\\nsome face that never looked up at her. Mary found herself unable to\\r\\ngo on writing. She turned her eyes away, but only to be aware of the\\r\\npresence of what Katharine looked at. There were ghosts in the room, and\\r\\none, strangely and sadly, was the ghost of herself. The minutes went by.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat would be the time now?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine at last. The half-hour was\\r\\nnot quite spent.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m going to get dinner ready,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, rising from her table.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll go,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you stay? Where are you going?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine looked round the room, conveying her uncertainty in her\\r\\nglance.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I might find him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she mused.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut why should it matter? YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll see him another day.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary spoke, and intended to speak, cruelly enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI was wrong to come here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir eyes met with antagonism, and neither flinched.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou had a perfect right to come here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nA loud knocking at the door interrupted them. Mary went to open it, and\\r\\nreturning with some note or parcel, Katharine looked away so that Mary\\r\\nmight not read her disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf course you had a right to come,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary repeated, laying the note upon\\r\\nthe table.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cExcept that when oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s desperate one has a sort\\r\\nof right. I am desperate. How do I know whatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s happening to him now? He\\r\\nmay do anything. He may wander about the streets all night. Anything may\\r\\nhappen to him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe spoke with a self-abandonment that Mary had never seen in her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou know you exaggerate; youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re talking nonsense,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said roughly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMary, I must talk--I must tell you--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou neednÃ¢\\x80\\x99t tell me anything,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary interrupted her. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t I see for\\r\\nmyself?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, no,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not that--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer look, passing beyond Mary, beyond the verge of the room and out\\r\\nbeyond any words that came her way, wildly and passionately, convinced\\r\\nMary that she, at any rate, could not follow such a glance to its end.\\r\\nShe was baffled; she tried to think herself back again into the height\\r\\nof her love for Ralph. Pressing her fingers upon her eyelids, she\\r\\nmurmured:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou forget that I loved him too. I thought I knew him. I DID know him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet, what had she known? She could not remember it any more. She\\r\\npressed her eyeballs until they struck stars and suns into her darkness.\\r\\nShe convinced herself that she was stirring among ashes. She desisted.\\r\\nShe was astonished at her discovery. She did not love Ralph any more.\\r\\nShe looked back dazed into the room, and her eyes rested upon the table\\r\\nwith its lamp-lit papers. The steady radiance seemed for a second to\\r\\nhave its counterpart within her; she shut her eyes; she opened them and\\r\\nlooked at the lamp again; another love burnt in the place of the old\\r\\none, or so, in a momentary glance of amazement, she guessed before the\\r\\nrevelation was over and the old surroundings asserted themselves. She\\r\\nleant in silence against the mantelpiece.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThere are different ways of loving,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she murmured, half to herself, at\\r\\nlength.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine made no reply and seemed unaware of her words. She seemed\\r\\nabsorbed in her own thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cPerhaps heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s waiting in the street again to-night,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll go now. I might find him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s far more likely that heÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll come here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mary, and Katharine,\\r\\nafter considering for a moment, said:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll wait another half-hour.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sank down into her chair again, and took up the same position which\\r\\nMary had compared to the position of one watching an unseeing face. She\\r\\nwatched, indeed, not a face, but a procession, not of people, but of\\r\\nlife itself: the good and bad; the meaning; the past, the present, and\\r\\nthe future. All this seemed apparent to her, and she was not ashamed\\r\\nof her extravagance so much as exalted to one of the pinnacles of\\r\\nexistence, where it behoved the world to do her homage. No one but\\r\\nshe herself knew what it meant to miss Ralph Denham on that particular\\r\\nnight; into this inadequate event crowded feelings that the great crises\\r\\nof life might have failed to call forth. She had missed him, and knew\\r\\nthe bitterness of all failure; she desired him, and knew the torment\\r\\nof all passion. It did not matter what trivial accidents led to this\\r\\nculmination. Nor did she care how extravagant she appeared, nor how\\r\\nopenly she showed her feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the dinner was ready Mary told her to come, and she came\\r\\nsubmissively, as if she let Mary direct her movements for her. They\\r\\nate and drank together almost in silence, and when Mary told her to\\r\\neat more, she ate more; when she was told to drink wine, she drank it.\\r\\nNevertheless, beneath this superficial obedience, Mary knew that she was\\r\\nfollowing her own thoughts unhindered. She was not inattentive so much\\r\\nas remote; she looked at once so unseeing and so intent upon some vision\\r\\nof her own that Mary gradually felt more than protective--she became\\r\\nactually alarmed at the prospect of some collision between Katharine\\r\\nand the forces of the outside world. Directly they had done, Katharine\\r\\nannounced her intention of going.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut where are you going to?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary asked, desiring vaguely to hinder\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m going home--no, to Highgate perhaps.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMary saw that it would be useless to try to stop her. All she could do\\r\\nwas to insist upon coming too, but she met with no opposition; Katharine\\r\\nseemed indifferent to her presence. In a few minutes they were walking\\r\\nalong the Strand. They walked so rapidly that Mary was deluded into\\r\\nthe belief that Katharine knew where she was going. She herself was not\\r\\nattentive. She was glad of the movement along lamp-lit streets in the\\r\\nopen air. She was fingering, painfully and with fear, yet with strange\\r\\nhope, too, the discovery which she had stumbled upon unexpectedly that\\r\\nnight. She was free once more at the cost of a gift, the best, perhaps,\\r\\nthat she could offer, but she was, thank Heaven, in love no longer.\\r\\nShe was tempted to spend the first instalment of her freedom in some\\r\\ndissipation; in the pit of the Coliseum, for example, since they were\\r\\nnow passing the door. Why not go in and celebrate her independence of\\r\\nthe tyranny of love? Or, perhaps, the top of an omnibus bound for some\\r\\nremote place such as Camberwell, or Sidcup, or the Welsh Harp would suit\\r\\nher better. She noticed these names painted on little boards for the\\r\\nfirst time for weeks. Or should she return to her room, and spend\\r\\nthe night working out the details of a very enlightened and ingenious\\r\\nscheme? Of all possibilities this appealed to her most, and brought to\\r\\nmind the fire, the lamplight, the steady glow which had seemed lit in\\r\\nthe place where a more passionate flame had once burnt.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Katharine stopped, and Mary woke to the fact that instead of having\\r\\na goal she had evidently none. She paused at the edge of the crossing,\\r\\nand looked this way and that, and finally made as if in the direction of\\r\\nHaverstock Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLook here--where are you going?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary cried, catching her by the hand.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe must take that cab and go home.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She hailed a cab and insisted that\\r\\nKatharine should get in, while she directed the driver to take them to\\r\\nCheyne Walk.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine submitted. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cVery well,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe may as well go there as\\r\\nanywhere else.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA gloom seemed to have fallen on her. She lay back in her corner, silent\\r\\nand apparently exhausted. Mary, in spite of her own preoccupation, was\\r\\nstruck by her pallor and her attitude of dejection.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sure we shall find him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said more gently than she had yet\\r\\nspoken.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt may be too late,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied. Without understanding her, Mary\\r\\nbegan to pity her for what she was suffering.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNonsense,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, taking her hand and rubbing it. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIf we donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t find\\r\\nhim there we shall find him somewhere else.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut suppose heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s walking about the streets--for hours and hours?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe leant forward and looked out of the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe may refuse ever to speak to me again,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said in a low voice,\\r\\nalmost to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exaggeration was so immense that Mary did not attempt to cope with\\r\\nit, save by keeping hold of KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s wrist. She half expected that\\r\\nKatharine might open the door suddenly and jump out. Perhaps Katharine\\r\\nperceived the purpose with which her hand was held.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be frightened,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, with a little laugh. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not going to\\r\\njump out of the cab. It wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t do much good after all.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this, Mary ostentatiously withdrew her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI ought to have apologized,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine continued, with an effort, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cfor\\r\\nbringing you into all this business; I havenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t told you half, either.\\r\\nIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m no longer engaged to William Rodney. He is to marry Cassandra Otway.\\r\\nItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all arranged--all perfectly right.... And after heÃ¢\\x80\\x99d waited in\\r\\nthe streets for hours and hours, William made me bring him in. He was\\r\\nstanding under the lamp-post watching our windows. He was perfectly\\r\\nwhite when he came into the room. William left us alone, and we sat and\\r\\ntalked. It seems ages and ages ago, now. Was it last night? Have I\\r\\nbeen out long? WhatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the time?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She sprang forward to catch sight of a\\r\\nclock, as if the exact time had some important bearing on her case.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOnly half-past eight!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThen he may be there still.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She\\r\\nleant out of the window and told the cabman to drive faster.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut if heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not there, what shall I do? Where could I find him? The\\r\\nstreets are so crowded.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe shall find him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mary repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had no doubt but that somehow or other they would find him. But\\r\\nsuppose they did find him? She began to think of Ralph with a sort of\\r\\nstrangeness, in her effort to understand how he could be capable of\\r\\nsatisfying this extraordinary desire. Once more she thought herself back\\r\\nto her old view of him and could, with an effort, recall the haze\\r\\nwhich surrounded his figure, and the sense of confused, heightened\\r\\nexhilaration which lay all about his neighborhood, so that for months at\\r\\na time she had never exactly heard his voice or seen his face--or so it\\r\\nnow seemed to her. The pain of her loss shot through her. Nothing would\\r\\never make up--not success, or happiness, or oblivion. But this pang was\\r\\nimmediately followed by the assurance that now, at any rate, she knew\\r\\nthe truth; and Katharine, she thought, stealing a look at her, did not\\r\\nknow the truth; yes, Katharine was immensely to be pitied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cab, which had been caught in the traffic, was now liberated and\\r\\nsped on down Sloane Street. Mary was conscious of the tension with which\\r\\nKatharine marked its progress, as if her mind were fixed upon a point in\\r\\nfront of them, and marked, second by second, their approach to it. She\\r\\nsaid nothing, and in silence Mary began to fix her mind, in sympathy\\r\\nat first, and later in forgetfulness of her companion, upon a point\\r\\nin front of them. She imagined a point distant as a low star upon the\\r\\nhorizon of the dark. There for her too, for them both, was the goal for\\r\\nwhich they were striving, and the end for the ardors of their spirits\\r\\nwas the same: but where it was, or what it was, or why she felt\\r\\nconvinced that they were united in search of it, as they drove swiftly\\r\\ndown the streets of London side by side, she could not have said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt last,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine breathed, as the cab drew up at the door. She\\r\\njumped out and scanned the pavement on either side. Mary, meanwhile,\\r\\nrang the bell. The door opened as Katharine assured herself that no one\\r\\nof the people within view had any likeness to Ralph. On seeing her, the\\r\\nmaid said at once:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMr. Denham called again, miss. He has been waiting for you for some\\r\\ntime.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine vanished from MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sight. The door shut between them, and\\r\\nMary walked slowly and thoughtfully up the street alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine turned at once to the dining-room. But with her fingers upon\\r\\nthe handle, she held back. Perhaps she realized that this was a moment\\r\\nwhich would never come again. Perhaps, for a second, it seemed to her\\r\\nthat no reality could equal the imagination she had formed. Perhaps she\\r\\nwas restrained by some vague fear or anticipation, which made her dread\\r\\nany exchange or interruption. But if these doubts and fears or this\\r\\nsupreme bliss restrained her, it was only for a moment. In another\\r\\nsecond she had turned the handle and, biting her lip to control herself,\\r\\nshe opened the door upon Ralph Denham. An extraordinary clearness of\\r\\nsight seemed to possess her on beholding him. So little, so single,\\r\\nso separate from all else he appeared, who had been the cause of these\\r\\nextreme agitations and aspirations. She could have laughed in his face.\\r\\nBut, gaining upon this clearness of sight against her will, and to her\\r\\ndislike, was a flood of confusion, of relief, of certainty, of humility,\\r\\nof desire no longer to strive and to discriminate, yielding to which,\\r\\nshe let herself sink within his arms and confessed her love.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXII\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody asked Katharine any questions next day. If cross-examined she\\r\\nmight have said that nobody spoke to her. She worked a little, wrote a\\r\\nlittle, ordered the dinner, and sat, for longer than she knew, with\\r\\nher head on her hand piercing whatever lay before her, whether it was\\r\\na letter or a dictionary, as if it were a film upon the deep prospects\\r\\nthat revealed themselves to her kindling and brooding eyes. She rose\\r\\nonce, and going to the bookcase, took out her fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Greek dictionary\\r\\nand spread the sacred pages of symbols and figures before her. She\\r\\nsmoothed the sheets with a mixture of affectionate amusement and hope.\\r\\nWould other eyes look on them with her one day? The thought, long\\r\\nintolerable, was now just bearable.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was quite unaware of the anxiety with which her movements were\\r\\nwatched and her expression scanned. Cassandra was careful not to be\\r\\ncaught looking at her, and their conversation was so prosaic that were\\r\\nit not for certain jolts and jerks between the sentences, as if the mind\\r\\nwere kept with difficulty to the rails, Mrs. Milvain herself could have\\r\\ndetected nothing of a suspicious nature in what she overheard.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam, when he came in late that afternoon and found Cassandra alone,\\r\\nhad a very serious piece of news to impart. He had just passed Katharine\\r\\nin the street and she had failed to recognize him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t matter with me, of course, but suppose it happened with\\r\\nsomebody else? What would they think? They would suspect something\\r\\nmerely from her expression. She looked--she lookedÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--he hesitated--Ã¢\\x80\\x9clike\\r\\nsome one walking in her sleep.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Cassandra the significant thing was that Katharine had gone out\\r\\nwithout telling her, and she interpreted this to mean that she had gone\\r\\nout to meet Ralph Denham. But to her surprise William drew no comfort\\r\\nfrom this probability.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOnce throw conventions aside,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he began, Ã¢\\x80\\x9conce do the things that\\r\\npeople donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t do--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d and the fact that you are going to meet a young man\\r\\nis no longer proof of anything, except, indeed, that people will talk.\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra saw, not without a pang of jealousy, that he was extremely\\r\\nsolicitous that people should not talk about Katharine, as if his\\r\\ninterest in her were still proprietary rather than friendly. As they\\r\\nwere both ignorant of RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s visit the night before they had not\\r\\nthat reason to comfort themselves with the thought that matters were\\r\\nhastening to a crisis. These absences of KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s, moreover, left\\r\\nthem exposed to interruptions which almost destroyed their pleasure in\\r\\nbeing alone together. The rainy evening made it impossible to go out;\\r\\nand, indeed, according to WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s code, it was considerably more\\r\\ndamning to be seen out of doors than surprised within. They were so much\\r\\nat the mercy of bells and doors that they could hardly talk of Macaulay\\r\\nwith any conviction, and William preferred to defer the second act of\\r\\nhis tragedy until another day.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder these circumstances Cassandra showed herself at her best. She\\r\\nsympathized with WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s anxieties and did her utmost to share them;\\r\\nbut still, to be alone together, to be running risks together, to be\\r\\npartners in the wonderful conspiracy, was to her so enthralling that\\r\\nshe was always forgetting discretion, breaking out into exclamations and\\r\\nadmirations which finally made William believe that, although deplorable\\r\\nand upsetting, the situation was not without its sweetness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the door did open, he started, but braved the forthcoming\\r\\nrevelation. It was not Mrs. Milvain, however, but Katharine herself who\\r\\nentered, closely followed by Ralph Denham. With a set expression which\\r\\nshowed what an effort she was making, Katharine encountered their eyes,\\r\\nand saying, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWeÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not going to interrupt you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she led Denham behind\\r\\nthe curtain which hung in front of the room with the relics. This refuge\\r\\nwas none of her willing, but confronted with wet pavements and only some\\r\\nbelated museum or Tube station for shelter, she was forced, for RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsake, to face the discomforts of her own house. Under the street lamps\\r\\nshe had thought him looking both tired and strained.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus separated, the two couples remained occupied for some time with\\r\\ntheir own affairs. Only the lowest murmurs penetrated from one section\\r\\nof the room to the other. At length the maid came in to bring a message\\r\\nthat Mr. Hilbery would not be home for dinner. It was true that there\\r\\nwas no need that Katharine should be informed, but William began to\\r\\ninquire CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s opinion in such a way as to show that, with or\\r\\nwithout reason, he wished very much to speak to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom motives of her own Cassandra dissuaded him.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you think itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a little unsociable?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he hazarded. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy not do\\r\\nsomething amusing?--go to the play, for instance? Why not ask Katharine\\r\\nand Ralph, eh?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d The coupling of their names in this manner caused\\r\\nCassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s heart to leap with pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you think they must be--?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she began, but William hastily took\\r\\nher up.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, I know nothing about that. I only thought we might amuse ourselves,\\r\\nas your uncleÃ¢\\x80\\x99s out.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe proceeded on his embassy with a mixture of excitement and\\r\\nembarrassment which caused him to turn aside with his hand on the\\r\\ncurtain, and to examine intently for several moments the portrait of\\r\\na lady, optimistically said by Mrs. Hilbery to be an early work of Sir\\r\\nJoshua Reynolds. Then, with some unnecessary fumbling, he drew aside the\\r\\ncurtain, and with his eyes fixed upon the ground, repeated his message\\r\\nand suggested that they should all spend the evening at the play.\\r\\nKatharine accepted the suggestion with such cordiality that it was\\r\\nstrange to find her of no clear mind as to the precise spectacle she\\r\\nwished to see. She left the choice entirely to Ralph and William, who,\\r\\ntaking counsel fraternally over an evening paper, found themselves\\r\\nin agreement as to the merits of a music-hall. This being arranged,\\r\\neverything else followed easily and enthusiastically. Cassandra had\\r\\nnever been to a music-hall. Katharine instructed her in the peculiar\\r\\ndelights of an entertainment where Polar bears follow directly upon\\r\\nladies in full evening dress, and the stage is alternately a garden of\\r\\nmystery, a millinerÃ¢\\x80\\x99s band-box, and a fried-fish shop in the Mile End\\r\\nRoad. Whatever the exact nature of the program that night, it fulfilled\\r\\nthe highest purposes of dramatic art, so far, at least, as four of the\\r\\naudience were concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt the actors and the authors would have been surprised to learn\\r\\nin what shape their efforts reached those particular eyes and ears; but\\r\\nthey could not have denied that the effect as a whole was tremendous.\\r\\nThe hall resounded with brass and strings, alternately of enormous pomp\\r\\nand majesty, and then of sweetest lamentation. The reds and creams\\r\\nof the background, the lyres and harps and urns and skulls, the\\r\\nprotuberances of plaster, the fringes of scarlet plush, the sinking\\r\\nand blazing of innumerable electric lights, could scarcely have been\\r\\nsurpassed for decorative effect by any craftsman of the ancient or\\r\\nmodern world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there was the audience itself, bare-shouldered, tufted and\\r\\ngarlanded in the stalls, decorous but festal in the balconies, and\\r\\nfrankly fit for daylight and street life in the galleries. But, however\\r\\nthey differed when looked at separately, they shared the same huge,\\r\\nlovable nature in the bulk, which murmured and swayed and quivered all\\r\\nthe time the dancing and juggling and love-making went on in front of\\r\\nit, slowly laughed and reluctantly left off laughing, and applauded\\r\\nwith a helter-skelter generosity which sometimes became unanimous and\\r\\noverwhelming. Once William saw Katharine leaning forward and clapping\\r\\nher hands with an abandonment that startled him. Her laugh rang out with\\r\\nthe laughter of the audience.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a second he was puzzled, as if this laughter disclosed something\\r\\nthat he had never suspected in her. But then CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s face caught his\\r\\neye, gazing with astonishment at the buffoon, not laughing, too deeply\\r\\nintent and surprised to laugh at what she saw, and for some moments he\\r\\nwatched her as if she were a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe performance came to an end, the illusion dying out first here and\\r\\nthen there, as some rose to put on their coats, others stood upright to\\r\\nsalute Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGod Save the King,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d the musicians folded their music and encased\\r\\ntheir instruments, and the lights sank one by one until the house was\\r\\nempty, silent, and full of great shadows. Looking back over her shoulder\\r\\nas she followed Ralph through the swing doors, Cassandra marveled to see\\r\\nhow the stage was already entirely without romance. But, she wondered,\\r\\ndid they really cover all the seats in brown holland every night?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe success of this entertainment was such that before they separated\\r\\nanother expedition had been planned for the next day. The next day was\\r\\nSaturday; therefore both William and Ralph were free to devote the whole\\r\\nafternoon to an expedition to Greenwich, which Cassandra had never seen,\\r\\nand Katharine confused with Dulwich. On this occasion Ralph was their\\r\\nguide. He brought them without accident to Greenwich.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat exigencies of state or fantasies of imagination first gave birth to\\r\\nthe cluster of pleasant places by which London is surrounded is matter\\r\\nof indifference now that they have adapted themselves so admirably to\\r\\nthe needs of people between the ages of twenty and thirty with Saturday\\r\\nafternoons to spend. Indeed, if ghosts have any interest in the\\r\\naffections of those who succeed them they must reap their richest\\r\\nharvests when the fine weather comes again and the lovers, the\\r\\nsightseers, and the holiday-makers pour themselves out of trains and\\r\\nomnibuses into their old pleasure-grounds. It is true that they go, for\\r\\nthe most part, unthanked by name, although upon this occasion William\\r\\nwas ready to give such discriminating praise as the dead architects and\\r\\npainters received seldom in the course of the year. They were walking by\\r\\nthe river bank, and Katharine and Ralph, lagging a little behind, caught\\r\\nfragments of his lecture. Katharine smiled at the sound of his voice;\\r\\nshe listened as if she found it a little unfamiliar, intimately though\\r\\nshe knew it; she tested it. The note of assurance and happiness was\\r\\nnew. William was very happy. She learnt every hour what sources of\\r\\nhis happiness she had neglected. She had never asked him to teach\\r\\nher anything; she had never consented to read Macaulay; she had never\\r\\nexpressed her belief that his play was second only to the works of\\r\\nShakespeare. She followed dreamily in their wake, smiling and delighting\\r\\nin the sound which conveyed, she knew, the rapturous and yet not servile\\r\\nassent of Cassandra.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she murmured, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow can Cassandra--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but changed her sentence to the\\r\\nopposite of what she meant to say and ended, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chow could she herself have\\r\\nbeen so blind?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d But it was unnecessary to follow out such riddles when\\r\\nthe presence of Ralph supplied her with more interesting problems, which\\r\\nsomehow became involved with the little boat crossing the river, the\\r\\nmajestic and careworn City, and the steamers homecoming with their\\r\\ntreasury, or starting in search of it, so that infinite leisure would\\r\\nbe necessary for the proper disentanglement of one from the other. He\\r\\nstopped, moreover, and began inquiring of an old boatman as to the tides\\r\\nand the ships. In thus talking he seemed different, and even looked\\r\\ndifferent, she thought, against the river, with the steeples and towers\\r\\nfor background. His strangeness, his romance, his power to leave her\\r\\nside and take part in the affairs of men, the possibility that they\\r\\nshould together hire a boat and cross the river, the speed and wildness\\r\\nof this enterprise filled her mind and inspired her with such rapture,\\r\\nhalf of love and half of adventure, that William and Cassandra were\\r\\nstartled from their talk, and Cassandra exclaimed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe looks as if she\\r\\nwere offering up a sacrifice! Very beautiful,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added quickly, though\\r\\nshe repressed, in deference to William, her own wonder that the sight of\\r\\nRalph Denham talking to a boatman on the banks of the Thames could move\\r\\nany one to such an attitude of adoration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat afternoon, what with tea and the curiosities of the Thames tunnel\\r\\nand the unfamiliarity of the streets, passed so quickly that the only\\r\\nmethod of prolonging it was to plan another expedition for the following\\r\\nday. Hampton Court was decided upon, in preference to Hampstead, for\\r\\nthough Cassandra had dreamt as a child of the brigands of Hampstead, she\\r\\nhad now transferred her affections completely and for ever to William\\r\\nIII. Accordingly, they arrived at Hampton Court about lunch-time on a\\r\\nfine Sunday morning. Such unity marked their expressions of admiration\\r\\nfor the red-brick building that they might have come there for no other\\r\\npurpose than to assure each other that this palace was the stateliest\\r\\npalace in the world. They walked up and down the Terrace, four abreast,\\r\\nand fancied themselves the owners of the place, and calculated the\\r\\namount of good to the world produced indubitably by such a tenancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe only hope for us,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cis that William shall die, and\\r\\nCassandra shall be given rooms as the widow of a distinguished poet.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOr--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra began, but checked herself from the liberty of\\r\\nenvisaging Katharine as the widow of a distinguished lawyer. Upon this,\\r\\nthe third day of junketing, it was tiresome to have to restrain oneself\\r\\neven from such innocent excursions of fancy. She dared not question\\r\\nWilliam; he was inscrutable; he never seemed even to follow the other\\r\\ncouple with curiosity when they separated, as they frequently did, to\\r\\nname a plant, or examine a fresco. Cassandra was constantly studying\\r\\ntheir backs. She noticed how sometimes the impulse to move came from\\r\\nKatharine, and sometimes from Ralph; how, sometimes, they walked slow,\\r\\nas if in profound intercourse, and sometimes fast, as if in passionate.\\r\\nWhen they came together again nothing could be more unconcerned than\\r\\ntheir manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe have been wondering whether they ever catch a fish...Ã¢\\x80\\x9d or, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe must\\r\\nleave time to visit the Maze.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Then, to puzzle her further, William and\\r\\nRalph filled in all interstices of meal-times or railway journeys with\\r\\nperfectly good-tempered arguments; or they discussed politics, or they\\r\\ntold stories, or they did sums together upon the backs of old envelopes\\r\\nto prove something. She suspected that Katharine was absent-minded, but\\r\\nit was impossible to tell. There were moments when she felt so young and\\r\\ninexperienced that she almost wished herself back with the silkworms at\\r\\nStogdon House, and not embarked upon this bewildering intrigue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese moments, however, were only the necessary shadow or chill which\\r\\nproved the substance of her bliss, and did not damage the radiance which\\r\\nseemed to rest equally upon the whole party. The fresh air of spring,\\r\\nthe sky washed of clouds and already shedding warmth from its blue,\\r\\nseemed the reply vouchsafed by nature to the mood of her chosen spirits.\\r\\nThese chosen spirits were to be found also among the deer, dumbly\\r\\nbasking, and among the fish, set still in mid-stream, for they were mute\\r\\nsharers in a benignant state not needing any exposition by the tongue.\\r\\nNo words that Cassandra could come by expressed the stillness, the\\r\\nbrightness, the air of expectancy which lay upon the orderly beauty\\r\\nof the grass walks and gravel paths down which they went walking four\\r\\nabreast that Sunday afternoon. Silently the shadows of the trees lay\\r\\nacross the broad sunshine; silence wrapt her heart in its folds. The\\r\\nquivering stillness of the butterfly on the half-opened flower, the\\r\\nsilent grazing of the deer in the sun, were the sights her eye rested\\r\\nupon and received as the images of her own nature laid open to happiness\\r\\nand trembling in its ecstasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the afternoon wore on, and it became time to leave the gardens.\\r\\nAs they drove from Waterloo to Chelsea, Katharine began to have some\\r\\ncompunction about her father, which, together with the opening of\\r\\noffices and the need of working in them on Monday, made it difficult to\\r\\nplan another festival for the following day. Mr. Hilbery had taken their\\r\\nabsence, so far, with paternal benevolence, but they could not trespass\\r\\nupon it indefinitely. Indeed, had they known it, he was already\\r\\nsuffering from their absence, and longing for their return.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had no dislike of solitude, and Sunday, in particular, was pleasantly\\r\\nadapted for letter-writing, paying calls, or a visit to his club. He was\\r\\nleaving the house on some such suitable expedition towards tea-time\\r\\nwhen he found himself stopped on his own doorstep by his sister, Mrs.\\r\\nMilvain. She should, on hearing that no one was at home, have withdrawn\\r\\nsubmissively, but instead she accepted his half-hearted invitation to\\r\\ncome in, and he found himself in the melancholy position of being forced\\r\\nto order tea for her and sit in the drawing-room while she drank it. She\\r\\nspeedily made it plain that she was only thus exacting because she had\\r\\ncome on a matter of business. He was by no means exhilarated at the\\r\\nnews.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine is out this afternoon,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he remarked. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy not come round\\r\\nlater and discuss it with her--with us both, eh?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear Trevor, I have particular reasons for wishing to talk to you\\r\\nalone.... Where is Katharine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s out with her young man, naturally. Cassandra plays the part of\\r\\nchaperone very usefully. A charming young woman that--a great favorite\\r\\nof mine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He turned his stone between his fingers, and conceived\\r\\ndifferent methods of leading Celia away from her obsession, which, he\\r\\nsupposed, must have reference to the domestic affairs of Cyril as usual.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWith Cassandra,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Milvain repeated significantly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWith Cassandra.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, with Cassandra,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hilbery agreed urbanely, pleased at the\\r\\ndiversion. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think they said they were going to Hampton Court, and I\\r\\nrather believe they were taking a protege of mine, Ralph Denham, a very\\r\\nclever fellow, too, to amuse Cassandra. I thought the arrangement very\\r\\nsuitable.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He was prepared to dwell at some length upon this safe topic,\\r\\nand trusted that Katharine would come in before he had done with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHampton Court always seems to me an ideal spot for engaged couples.\\r\\nThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the Maze, thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a nice place for having tea--I forget what\\r\\nthey call it--and then, if the young man knows his business he contrives\\r\\nto take his lady upon the river. Full of possibilities--full. Cake,\\r\\nCelia?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hilbery continued. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI respect my dinner too much, but that\\r\\ncanÃ¢\\x80\\x99t possibly apply to you. YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve never observed that feast, so far as\\r\\nI can remember.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer brotherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s affability did not deceive Mrs. Milvain; it slightly\\r\\nsaddened her; she well knew the cause of it. Blind and infatuated as\\r\\nusual!\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWho is this Mr. Denham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cRalph Denham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Hilbery, in relief that her mind had taken this\\r\\nturn. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cA very interesting young man. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve a great belief in him. HeÃ¢\\x80\\x99s an\\r\\nauthority upon our mediaeval institutions, and if he werenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t forced to\\r\\nearn his living he would write a book that very much wants writing--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe is not well off, then?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Milvain interposed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t a penny, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m afraid, and a family more or less dependent on\\r\\nhim.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA mother and sisters?--His father is dead?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, his father died some years ago,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Hilbery, who was\\r\\nprepared to draw upon his imagination, if necessary, to keep Mrs.\\r\\nMilvain supplied with facts about the private history of Ralph Denham\\r\\nsince, for some inscrutable reason, the subject took her fancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHis father has been dead some time, and this young man had to take his\\r\\nplace--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA legal family?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Milvain inquired. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI fancy IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve seen the name\\r\\nsomewhere.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hilbery shook his head. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI should be inclined to doubt whether they\\r\\nwere altogether in that walk of life,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he observed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI fancy that Denham\\r\\nonce told me that his father was a corn merchant. Perhaps he said a\\r\\nstockbroker. He came to grief, anyhow, as stockbrokers have a way of\\r\\ndoing. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve a great respect for Denham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added. The remark sounded\\r\\nto his ears unfortunately conclusive, and he was afraid that there\\r\\nwas nothing more to be said about Denham. He examined the tips of his\\r\\nfingers carefully. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s grown into a very charming young woman,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n he started afresh. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCharming to look at, and charming to talk to, though\\r\\nher historical knowledge is not altogether profound. Another cup of\\r\\ntea?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Milvain had given her cup a little push, which seemed to indicate\\r\\nsome momentary displeasure. But she did not want any more tea.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt is Cassandra that I have come about,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she began. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am very sorry\\r\\nto say that Cassandra is not at all what you think her, Trevor. She has\\r\\nimposed upon your and MaggieÃ¢\\x80\\x99s goodness. She has behaved in a way that\\r\\nwould have seemed incredible--in this house of all houses--were it not\\r\\nfor other circumstances that are still more incredible.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hilbery looked taken aback, and was silent for a second.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt all sounds very black,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he remarked urbanely, continuing his\\r\\nexamination of his finger-nails. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut I own I am completely in the\\r\\ndark.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Milvain became rigid, and emitted her message in little short\\r\\nsentences of extreme intensity.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWho has Cassandra gone out with? William Rodney. Who has Katharine gone\\r\\nout with? Ralph Denham. Why are they for ever meeting each other round\\r\\nstreet corners, and going to music-halls, and taking cabs late at\\r\\nnight? Why will Katharine not tell me the truth when I question her?\\r\\nI understand the reason now. Katharine has entangled herself with this\\r\\nunknown lawyer; she has seen fit to condone CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s conduct.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was another slight pause.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, well, Katharine will no doubt have some explanation to give me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Mr. Hilbery replied imperturbably. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s a little too complicated for\\r\\nme to take in all at once, I confess--and, if you wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think me rude,\\r\\nCelia, I think IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll be getting along towards Knightsbridge.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Milvain rose at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe has condoned CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s conduct and entangled herself with Ralph\\r\\nDenham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she repeated. She stood very erect with the dauntless air of\\r\\none testifying to the truth regardless of consequences. She knew from\\r\\npast discussions that the only way to counter her brotherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s indolence\\r\\nand indifference was to shoot her statements at him in a compressed form\\r\\nonce finally upon leaving the room. Having spoken thus, she restrained\\r\\nherself from adding another word, and left the house with the dignity of\\r\\none inspired by a great ideal.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had certainly framed her remarks in such a way as to prevent her\\r\\nbrother from paying his call in the region of Knightsbridge. He had no\\r\\nfears for Katharine, but there was a suspicion at the back of his mind\\r\\nthat Cassandra might have been, innocently and ignorantly, led into some\\r\\nfoolish situation in one of their unshepherded dissipations. His wife\\r\\nwas an erratic judge of the conventions; he himself was lazy; and with\\r\\nKatharine absorbed, very naturally--Here he recalled, as well as he\\r\\ncould, the exact nature of the charge. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe has condoned CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nconduct and entangled herself with Ralph Denham.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d From which it appeared\\r\\nthat Katharine was NOT absorbed, or which of them was it that had\\r\\nentangled herself with Ralph Denham? From this maze of absurdity Mr.\\r\\nHilbery saw no way out until Katharine herself came to his help, so that\\r\\nhe applied himself, very philosophically on the whole, to a book.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner had he heard the young people come in and go upstairs than he\\r\\nsent a maid to tell Miss Katharine that he wished to speak to her in the\\r\\nstudy. She was slipping furs loosely onto the floor in the drawing-room\\r\\nin front of the fire. They were all gathered round, reluctant to part.\\r\\nThe message from her father surprised Katharine, and the others caught\\r\\nfrom her look, as she turned to go, a vague sense of apprehension.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hilbery was reassured by the sight of her. He congratulated himself,\\r\\nhe prided himself, upon possessing a daughter who had a sense of\\r\\nresponsibility and an understanding of life profound beyond her years.\\r\\nMoreover, she was looking to-day unusual; he had come to take her beauty\\r\\nfor granted; now he remembered it and was surprised by it. He thought\\r\\ninstinctively that he had interrupted some happy hour of hers with\\r\\nRodney, and apologized.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m sorry to bother you, my dear. I heard you come in, and thought IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nbetter make myself disagreeable at once--as it seems, unfortunately,\\r\\nthat fathers are expected to make themselves disagreeable. Now, your\\r\\nAunt Celia has been to see me; your Aunt Celia has taken it into her\\r\\nhead apparently that you and Cassandra have been--let us say a\\r\\nlittle foolish. This going about together--these pleasant little\\r\\nparties--thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s been some kind of misunderstanding. I told her I saw no\\r\\nharm in it, but I should just like to hear from yourself. Has Cassandra\\r\\nbeen left a little too much in the company of Mr. Denham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine did not reply at once, and Mr. Hilbery tapped the coal\\r\\nencouragingly with the poker. Then she said, without embarrassment or\\r\\napology:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see why I should answer Aunt CeliaÃ¢\\x80\\x99s questions. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve told her\\r\\nalready that I wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hilbery was relieved and secretly amused at the thought of the\\r\\ninterview, although he could not license such irreverence outwardly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cVery good. Then you authorize me to tell her that sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s been mistaken,\\r\\nand there was nothing but a little fun in it? YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve no doubt,\\r\\nKatharine, in your own mind? Cassandra is in our charge, and I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nintend that people should gossip about her. I suggest that you should be\\r\\na little more careful in future. Invite me to your next entertainment.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not respond, as he had hoped, with any affectionate or humorous\\r\\nreply. She meditated, pondering something or other, and he reflected\\r\\nthat even his Katharine did not differ from other women in the capacity\\r\\nto let things be. Or had she something to say?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHave you a guilty conscience?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he inquired lightly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cTell me,\\r\\nKatharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said more seriously, struck by something in the\\r\\nexpression of her eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been meaning to tell you for some time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not going\\r\\nto marry William.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not going--!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed, dropping the poker in his immense\\r\\nsurprise. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy? When? Explain yourself, Katharine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, some time ago--a week, perhaps more.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine spoke hurriedly and\\r\\nindifferently, as if the matter could no longer concern any one.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut may I ask--why have I not been told of this--what do you mean by\\r\\nit?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t wish to be married--thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s wish as well as yours?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, yes. We agree perfectly.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hilbery had seldom felt more completely at a loss. He thought that\\r\\nKatharine was treating the matter with curious unconcern; she scarcely\\r\\nseemed aware of the gravity of what she was saying; he did not\\r\\nunderstand the position at all. But his desire to smooth everything over\\r\\ncomfortably came to his relief. No doubt there was some quarrel, some\\r\\nwhimsey on the part of William, who, though a good fellow, was a little\\r\\nexacting sometimes--something that a woman could put right. But though\\r\\nhe inclined to take the easiest view of his responsibilities, he cared\\r\\ntoo much for this daughter to let things be.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI confess I find great difficulty in following you. I should like to\\r\\nhear WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s side of the story,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said irritably. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think he ought\\r\\nto have spoken to me in the first instance.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t let him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI know it must seem to you very\\r\\nstrange,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut I assure you, if youÃ¢\\x80\\x99d wait a little--until\\r\\nmother comes back.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis appeal for delay was much to Mr. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s liking. But his\\r\\nconscience would not suffer it. People were talking. He could not endure\\r\\nthat his daughterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s conduct should be in any way considered irregular.\\r\\nHe wondered whether, in the circumstances, it would be better to wire to\\r\\nhis wife, to send for one of his sisters, to forbid William the\\r\\nhouse, to pack Cassandra off home--for he was vaguely conscious of\\r\\nresponsibilities in her direction, too. His forehead was becoming more\\r\\nand more wrinkled by the multiplicity of his anxieties, which he was\\r\\nsorely tempted to ask Katharine to solve for him, when the door opened\\r\\nand William Rodney appeared. This necessitated a complete change, not\\r\\nonly of manner, but of position also.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s William,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine exclaimed, in a tone of relief. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve told\\r\\nfather weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not engaged,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said to him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve explained that I\\r\\nprevented you from telling him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s manner was marked by the utmost formality. He bowed very\\r\\nslightly in the direction of Mr. Hilbery, and stood erect, holding one\\r\\nlapel of his coat, and gazing into the center of the fire. He waited for\\r\\nMr. Hilbery to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hilbery also assumed an appearance of formidable dignity. He had\\r\\nrisen to his feet, and now bent the top part of his body slightly\\r\\nforward.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI should like your account of this affair, Rodney--if Katharine no\\r\\nlonger prevents you from speaking.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam waited two seconds at least.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOur engagement is at an end,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, with the utmost stiffness.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHas this been arrived at by your joint desire?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a perceptible pause William bent his head, and Katharine said, as\\r\\nif by an afterthought:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, yes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hilbery swayed to and fro, and moved his lips as if to utter remarks\\r\\nwhich remained unspoken.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI can only suggest that you should postpone any decision until the\\r\\neffect of this misunderstanding has had time to wear off. You have now\\r\\nknown each other--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he began.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s been no misunderstanding,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine interposed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNothing at\\r\\nall.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She moved a few paces across the room, as if she intended to\\r\\nleave them. Her preoccupied naturalness was in strange contrast to her\\r\\nfatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s pomposity and to WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s military rigidity. He had not once\\r\\nraised his eyes. KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s glance, on the other hand, ranged past the\\r\\ntwo gentlemen, along the books, over the tables, towards the door.\\r\\nShe was paying the least possible attention, it seemed, to what was\\r\\nhappening. Her father looked at her with a sudden clouding and troubling\\r\\nof his expression. Somehow his faith in her stability and sense was\\r\\nqueerly shaken. He no longer felt that he could ultimately entrust her\\r\\nwith the whole conduct of her own affairs after a superficial show of\\r\\ndirecting them. He felt, for the first time in many years, responsible\\r\\nfor her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLook here, we must get to the bottom of this,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, dropping his\\r\\nformal manner and addressing Rodney as if Katharine were not present.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve had some difference of opinion, eh? Take my word for it, most\\r\\npeople go through this sort of thing when theyÃ¢\\x80\\x99re engaged. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve seen\\r\\nmore trouble come from long engagements than from any other form\\r\\nof human folly. Take my advice and put the whole matter out of your\\r\\nminds--both of you. I prescribe a complete abstinence from emotion.\\r\\nVisit some cheerful seaside resort, Rodney.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was struck by WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s appearance, which seemed to him to indicate\\r\\nprofound feeling resolutely held in check. No doubt, he reflected,\\r\\nKatharine had been very trying, unconsciously trying, and had driven\\r\\nhim to take up a position which was none of his willing. Mr. Hilbery\\r\\ncertainly did not overrate WilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sufferings. No minutes in his life\\r\\nhad hitherto extorted from him such intensity of anguish. He was\\r\\nnow facing the consequences of his insanity. He must confess himself\\r\\nentirely and fundamentally other than Mr. Hilbery thought him.\\r\\nEverything was against him. Even the Sunday evening and the fire and the\\r\\ntranquil library scene were against him. Mr. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s appeal to him as\\r\\na man of the world was terribly against him. He was no longer a man of\\r\\nany world that Mr. Hilbery cared to recognize. But some power compelled\\r\\nhim, as it had compelled him to come downstairs, to make his stand here\\r\\nand now, alone and unhelped by any one, without prospect of reward. He\\r\\nfumbled with various phrases; and then jerked out:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI love Cassandra.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s face turned a curious dull purple. He looked at his\\r\\ndaughter. He nodded his head, as if to convey his silent command to her\\r\\nto leave the room; but either she did not notice it or preferred not to\\r\\nobey.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou have the impudence--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hilbery began, in a dull, low voice\\r\\nthat he himself had never heard before, when there was a scuffling and\\r\\nexclaiming in the hall, and Cassandra, who appeared to be insisting\\r\\nagainst some dissuasion on the part of another, burst into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUncle Trevor,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI insist upon telling you the truth!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n She flung herself between Rodney and her uncle, as if she sought to\\r\\nintercept their blows. As her uncle stood perfectly still, looking very\\r\\nlarge and imposing, and as nobody spoke, she shrank back a little, and\\r\\nlooked first at Katharine and then at Rodney. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou must know the truth,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she said, a little lamely.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou have the impudence to tell me this in KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s presence?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr.\\r\\nHilbery continued, speaking with complete disregard of CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ninterruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI am aware, quite aware--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d RodneyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s words, which were broken in sense,\\r\\nspoken after a pause, and with his eyes upon the ground, nevertheless\\r\\nexpressed an astonishing amount of resolution. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI am quite aware what\\r\\nyou must think of me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he brought out, looking Mr. Hilbery directly in\\r\\nthe eyes for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI could express my views on the subject more fully if we were alone,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Mr. Hilbery returned.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut you forget me,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine. She moved a little towards Rodney,\\r\\nand her movement seemed to testify mutely to her respect for him, and\\r\\nher alliance with him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI think William has behaved perfectly rightly,\\r\\nand, after all, it is I who am concerned--I and Cassandra.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra, too, gave an indescribably slight movement which seemed to\\r\\ndraw the three of them into alliance together. KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s tone and\\r\\nglance made Mr. Hilbery once more feel completely at a loss, and in\\r\\naddition, painfully and angrily obsolete; but in spite of an awful inner\\r\\nhollowness he was outwardly composed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cCassandra and Rodney have a perfect right to settle their own affairs\\r\\naccording to their own wishes; but I see no reason why they should do\\r\\nso either in my room or in my house.... I wish to be quite clear on this\\r\\npoint, however; you are no longer engaged to Rodney.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused, and his pause seemed to signify that he was extremely\\r\\nthankful for his daughterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s deliverance.\\r\\n\\r\\nCassandra turned to Katharine, who drew her breath as if to speak and\\r\\nchecked herself; Rodney, too, seemed to await some movement on her\\r\\npart; her father glanced at her as if he half anticipated some further\\r\\nrevelation. She remained perfectly silent. In the silence they heard\\r\\ndistinctly steps descending the staircase, and Katharine went straight\\r\\nto the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWait,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hilbery commanded. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI wish to speak to you--alone,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nadded.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe paused, holding the door ajar.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll come back,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, and as she spoke she opened the door and\\r\\nwent out. They could hear her immediately speak to some one outside,\\r\\nthough the words were inaudible.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hilbery was left confronting the guilty couple, who remained\\r\\nstanding as if they did not accept their dismissal, and the\\r\\ndisappearance of Katharine had brought some change into the situation.\\r\\nSo, in his secret heart, Mr. Hilbery felt that it had, for he could not\\r\\nexplain his daughterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s behavior to his own satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUncle Trevor,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra exclaimed impulsively, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cdonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be angry,\\r\\nplease. I couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t help it; I do beg you to forgive me.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer uncle still refused to acknowledge her identity, and still talked\\r\\nover her head as if she did not exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose you have communicated with the Otways,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said to Rodney\\r\\ngrimly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cUncle Trevor, we wanted to tell you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra replied for him. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe\\r\\nwaited--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she looked appealingly at Rodney, who shook his head ever so\\r\\nslightly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes? What were you waiting for?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d her uncle asked sharply, looking at\\r\\nher at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words died on her lips. It was apparent that she was straining her\\r\\nears as if to catch some sound outside the room that would come to her\\r\\nhelp. He received no answer. He listened, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThis is a most unpleasant business for all parties,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he concluded,\\r\\nsinking into his chair again, hunching his shoulders and regarding the\\r\\nflames. He seemed to speak to himself, and Rodney and Cassandra looked\\r\\nat him in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you sit down?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said suddenly. He spoke gruffly, but the\\r\\nforce of his anger was evidently spent, or some preoccupation had turned\\r\\nhis mood to other regions. While Cassandra accepted his invitation,\\r\\nRodney remained standing.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI think Cassandra can explain matters better in my absence,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said,\\r\\nand left the room, Mr. Hilbery giving his assent by a slight nod of the\\r\\nhead.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, in the dining-room next door, Denham and Katharine were\\r\\nonce more seated at the mahogany table. They seemed to be continuing a\\r\\nconversation broken off in the middle, as if each remembered the precise\\r\\npoint at which they had been interrupted, and was eager to go on as\\r\\nquickly as possible. Katharine, having interposed a short account of the\\r\\ninterview with her father, Denham made no comment, but said:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnyhow, thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s no reason why we shouldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see each other.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOr stay together. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s only marriage thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s out of the question,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n Katharine replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut if I find myself coming to want you more and more?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf our lapses come more and more often?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sighed impatiently, and said nothing for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut at least,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he renewed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cweÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve established the fact that my lapses\\r\\nare still in some odd way connected with you; yours have nothing to do\\r\\nwith me. Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, his assumption of reason broken up by\\r\\nhis agitation, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI assure you that we are in love--what other people\\r\\ncall love. Remember that night. We had no doubts whatever then. We were\\r\\nabsolutely happy for half an hour. You had no lapse until the day after;\\r\\nI had no lapse until yesterday morning. WeÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been happy at intervals\\r\\nall day until I--went off my head, and you, quite naturally, were\\r\\nbored.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed, as if the subject chafed her, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t make you\\r\\nunderstand. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not boredom--IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m never bored. Reality--reality,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nejaculated, tapping her finger upon the table as if to emphasize and\\r\\nperhaps explain her isolated utterance of this word. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI cease to be real\\r\\nto you. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the faces in a storm again--the vision in a hurricane. We\\r\\ncome together for a moment and we part. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s my fault, too. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m as bad\\r\\nas you are--worse, perhaps.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were trying to explain, not for the first time, as their weary\\r\\ngestures and frequent interruptions showed, what in their common\\r\\nlanguage they had christened their Ã¢\\x80\\x9clapsesÃ¢\\x80\\x9d; a constant source of\\r\\ndistress to them, in the past few days, and the immediate reason why\\r\\nRalph was on his way to leave the house when Katharine, listening\\r\\nanxiously, heard him and prevented him. What was the cause of these\\r\\nlapses? Either because Katharine looked more beautiful, or more strange,\\r\\nbecause she wore something different, or said something unexpected,\\r\\nRalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sense of her romance welled up and overcame him either into\\r\\nsilence or into inarticulate expressions, which Katharine, with\\r\\nunintentional but invariable perversity, interrupted or contradicted\\r\\nwith some severity or assertion of prosaic fact. Then the vision\\r\\ndisappeared, and Ralph expressed vehemently in his turn the conviction\\r\\nthat he only loved her shadow and cared nothing for her reality. If the\\r\\nlapse was on her side it took the form of gradual detachment until she\\r\\nbecame completely absorbed in her own thoughts, which carried her\\r\\naway with such intensity that she sharply resented any recall to her\\r\\ncompanionÃ¢\\x80\\x99s side. It was useless to assert that these trances were\\r\\nalways originated by Ralph himself, however little in their later stages\\r\\nthey had to do with him. The fact remained that she had no need of him\\r\\nand was very loath to be reminded of him. How, then, could they be in\\r\\nlove? The fragmentary nature of their relationship was but too apparent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus they sat depressed to silence at the dining-room table, oblivious\\r\\nof everything, while Rodney paced the drawing-room overhead in such\\r\\nagitation and exaltation of mind as he had never conceived possible,\\r\\nand Cassandra remained alone with her uncle. Ralph, at length, rose and\\r\\nwalked gloomily to the window. He pressed close to the pane. Outside\\r\\nwere truth and freedom and the immensity only to be apprehended by\\r\\nthe mind in loneliness, and never communicated to another. What worse\\r\\nsacrilege was there than to attempt to violate what he perceived by\\r\\nseeking to impart it? Some movement behind him made him reflect that\\r\\nKatharine had the power, if she chose, to be in person what he dreamed\\r\\nof her spirit. He turned sharply to implore her help, when again he was\\r\\nstruck cold by her look of distance, her expression of intentness upon\\r\\nsome far object. As if conscious of his look upon her she rose and came\\r\\nto him, standing close by his side, and looking with him out into the\\r\\ndusky atmosphere. Their physical closeness was to him a bitter enough\\r\\ncomment upon the distance between their minds. Yet distant as she\\r\\nwas, her presence by his side transformed the world. He saw himself\\r\\nperforming wonderful deeds of courage; saving the drowning, rescuing the\\r\\nforlorn. Impatient with this form of egotism, he could not shake off\\r\\nthe conviction that somehow life was wonderful, romantic, a master\\r\\nworth serving so long as she stood there. He had no wish that she should\\r\\nspeak; he did not look at her or touch her; she was apparently deep in\\r\\nher own thoughts and oblivious of his presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door opened without their hearing the sound. Mr. Hilbery looked\\r\\nround the room, and for a moment failed to discover the two figures in\\r\\nthe window. He started with displeasure when he saw them, and observed\\r\\nthem keenly before he appeared able to make up his mind to say anything.\\r\\nHe made a movement finally that warned them of his presence; they turned\\r\\ninstantly. Without speaking, he beckoned to Katharine to come to him,\\r\\nand, keeping his eyes from the region of the room where Denham stood,\\r\\nhe shepherded her in front of him back to the study. When Katharine was\\r\\ninside the room he shut the study door carefully behind him as if to\\r\\nsecure himself from something that he disliked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, taking up his stand in front of the fire,\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cyou will, perhaps, have the kindness to explain--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She remained silent.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat inferences do you expect me to draw?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said sharply.... Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\ntell me that you are not engaged to Rodney; I see you on what appear to\\r\\nbe extremely intimate terms with another--with Ralph Denham. What am I\\r\\nto conclude? Are you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he added, as she still said nothing, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cengaged to\\r\\nRalph Denham?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis sense of relief was great; he had been certain that her answer would\\r\\nhave confirmed his suspicions, but that anxiety being set at rest, he\\r\\nwas the more conscious of annoyance with her for her behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen all I can say is that youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve very strange ideas of the proper\\r\\nway to behave.... People have drawn certain conclusions, nor am I\\r\\nsurprised.... The more I think of it the more inexplicable I find it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n he went on, his anger rising as he spoke. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy am I left in ignorance of\\r\\nwhat is going on in my own house? Why am I left to hear of these events\\r\\nfor the first time from my sister? Most disagreeable--most upsetting.\\r\\nHow IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m to explain to your Uncle Francis--but I wash my hands of it.\\r\\nCassandra goes tomorrow. I forbid Rodney the house. As for the other\\r\\nyoung man, the sooner he makes himself scarce the better. After placing\\r\\nthe most implicit trust in you, Katharine--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He broke off, disquieted\\r\\nby the ominous silence with which his words were received, and looked at\\r\\nhis daughter with the curious doubt as to her state of mind which he had\\r\\nfelt before, for the first time, this evening. He perceived once more\\r\\nthat she was not attending to what he said, but was listening, and for a\\r\\nmoment he, too, listened for sounds outside the room. His certainty that\\r\\nthere was some understanding between Denham and Katharine returned, but\\r\\nwith a most unpleasant suspicion that there was something illicit about\\r\\nit, as the whole position between the young people seemed to him gravely\\r\\nillicit.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll speak to Denham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, on the impulse of his suspicion, moving\\r\\nas if to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI shall come with you,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine said instantly, starting forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou will stay here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said her father.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat are you going to say to him?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI suppose I may say what I like in my own house?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he returned.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThen I go, too,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt these words, which seemed to imply a determination to go--to go for\\r\\never, Mr. Hilbery returned to his position in front of the fire, and\\r\\nbegan swaying slightly from side to side without for the moment making\\r\\nany remark.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI understood you to say that you were not engaged to him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said at\\r\\nlength, fixing his eyes upon his daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe are not engaged,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIt should be a matter of indifference to you, then, whether he comes\\r\\nhere or not--I will not have you listening to other things when I am\\r\\nspeaking to you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he broke off angrily, perceiving a slight movement on\\r\\nher part to one side. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAnswer me frankly, what is your relationship with\\r\\nthis young man?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNothing that I can explain to a third person,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said obstinately.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI will have no more of these equivocations,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI refuse to explain,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she returned, and as she said it the front door\\r\\nbanged to. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThere!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHe is gone!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She flashed such a look\\r\\nof fiery indignation at her father that he lost his self-control for a\\r\\nmoment.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFor GodÃ¢\\x80\\x99s sake, Katharine, control yourself!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked for a moment like a wild animal caged in a civilized\\r\\ndwelling-place. She glanced over the walls covered with books, as if for\\r\\na second she had forgotten the position of the door. Then she made as if\\r\\nto go, but her father laid his hand upon her shoulder. He compelled her\\r\\nto sit down.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThese emotions have been very upsetting, naturally,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. His\\r\\nmanner had regained all its suavity, and he spoke with a soothing\\r\\nassumption of paternal authority. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been placed in a very\\r\\ndifficult position, as I understand from Cassandra. Now let us come to\\r\\nterms; we will leave these agitating questions in peace for the present.\\r\\nMeanwhile, let us try to behave like civilized beings. Let us read Sir\\r\\nWalter Scott. What dÃ¢\\x80\\x99you say to Ã¢\\x80\\x98The Antiquary,Ã¢\\x80\\x99 eh? Or Ã¢\\x80\\x98The Bride of\\r\\nLammermoorÃ¢\\x80\\x99?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made his own choice, and before his daughter could protest or make\\r\\nher escape, she found herself being turned by the agency of Sir Walter\\r\\nScott into a civilized human being.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet Mr. Hilbery had grave doubts, as he read, whether the process\\r\\nwas more than skin-deep. Civilization had been very profoundly and\\r\\nunpleasantly overthrown that evening; the extent of the ruin was still\\r\\nundetermined; he had lost his temper, a physical disaster not to be\\r\\nmatched for the space of ten years or so; and his own condition urgently\\r\\nrequired soothing and renovating at the hands of the classics. His house\\r\\nwas in a state of revolution; he had a vision of unpleasant encounters\\r\\non the staircase; his meals would be poisoned for days to come; was\\r\\nliterature itself a specific against such disagreeables? A note of\\r\\nhollowness was in his voice as he read.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIII\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering that Mr. Hilbery lived in a house which was accurately\\r\\nnumbered in order with its fellows, and that he filled up forms, paid\\r\\nrent, and had seven more years of tenancy to run, he had an excuse for\\r\\nlaying down laws for the conduct of those who lived in his house, and\\r\\nthis excuse, though profoundly inadequate, he found useful during the\\r\\ninterregnum of civilization with which he now found himself faced. In\\r\\nobedience to those laws, Rodney disappeared; Cassandra was dispatched to\\r\\ncatch the eleven-thirty on Monday morning; Denham was seen no more; so\\r\\nthat only Katharine, the lawful occupant of the upper rooms, remained,\\r\\nand Mr. Hilbery thought himself competent to see that she did nothing\\r\\nfurther to compromise herself. As he bade her good morning next day\\r\\nhe was aware that he knew nothing of what she was thinking, but, as\\r\\nhe reflected with some bitterness, even this was an advance upon the\\r\\nignorance of the previous mornings. He went to his study, wrote, tore\\r\\nup, and wrote again a letter to his wife, asking her to come back on\\r\\naccount of domestic difficulties which he specified at first, but in a\\r\\nlater draft more discreetly left unspecified. Even if she started the\\r\\nvery moment that she got it, he reflected, she would not be home till\\r\\nTuesday night, and he counted lugubriously the number of hours that he\\r\\nwould have to spend in a position of detestable authority alone with his\\r\\ndaughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was she doing now, he wondered, as he addressed the envelope to his\\r\\nwife. He could not control the telephone. He could not play the spy.\\r\\nShe might be making any arrangements she chose. Yet the thought did not\\r\\ndisturb him so much as the strange, unpleasant, illicit atmosphere of\\r\\nthe whole scene with the young people the night before. His sense of\\r\\ndiscomfort was almost physical.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad he known it, Katharine was far enough withdrawn, both physically\\r\\nand spiritually, from the telephone. She sat in her room with the\\r\\ndictionaries spreading their wide leaves on the table before her, and\\r\\nall the pages which they had concealed for so many years arranged in a\\r\\npile. She worked with the steady concentration that is produced by\\r\\nthe successful effort to think down some unwelcome thought by means of\\r\\nanother thought. Having absorbed the unwelcome thought, her mind went\\r\\non with additional vigor, derived from the victory; on a sheet of paper\\r\\nlines of figures and symbols frequently and firmly written down marked\\r\\nthe different stages of its progress. And yet it was broad daylight;\\r\\nthere were sounds of knocking and sweeping, which proved that living\\r\\npeople were at work on the other side of the door, and the door, which\\r\\ncould be thrown open in a second, was her only protection against the\\r\\nworld. But she had somehow risen to be mistress in her own kingdom,\\r\\nassuming her sovereignty unconsciously.\\r\\n\\r\\nSteps approached her unheard. It is true that they were steps that\\r\\nlingered, divagated, and mounted with the deliberation natural to one\\r\\npast sixty whose arms, moreover, are full of leaves and blossoms; but\\r\\nthey came on steadily, and soon a tap of laurel boughs against the door\\r\\narrested KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s pencil as it touched the page. She did not move,\\r\\nhowever, and sat blank-eyed as if waiting for the interruption to cease.\\r\\nInstead, the door opened. At first, she attached no meaning to the\\r\\nmoving mass of green which seemed to enter the room independently of any\\r\\nhuman agency. Then she recognized parts of her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s face and person\\r\\nbehind the yellow flowers and soft velvet of the palm-buds.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cFrom ShakespeareÃ¢\\x80\\x99s tomb!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery, dropping the entire\\r\\nmass upon the floor, with a gesture that seemed to indicate an act of\\r\\ndedication. Then she flung her arms wide and embraced her daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThank God, Katharine!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThank God!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve come back?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, very vaguely, standing up to receive\\r\\nthe embrace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough she recognized her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s presence, she was very far from\\r\\ntaking part in the scene, and yet felt it to be amazingly appropriate\\r\\nthat her mother should be there, thanking God emphatically for\\r\\nunknown blessings, and strewing the floor with flowers and leaves from\\r\\nShakespeareÃ¢\\x80\\x99s tomb.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNothing else matters in the world!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery continued. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNames\\r\\narenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t everything; itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what we feel thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s everything. I didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want\\r\\nsilly, kind, interfering letters. I didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want your father to tell me.\\r\\nI knew it from the first. I prayed that it might be so.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou knew it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine repeated her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s words softly and vaguely,\\r\\nlooking past her. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow did you know it?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She began, like a child, to\\r\\nfinger a tassel hanging from her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s cloak.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThe first evening you told me, Katharine. Oh, and thousands of\\r\\ntimes--dinner-parties--talking about books--the way he came into the\\r\\nroom--your voice when you spoke of him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine seemed to consider each of these proofs separately. Then she\\r\\nsaid gravely:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not going to marry William. And then thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Cassandra--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, thereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Cassandra,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Hilbery. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI own I was a little\\r\\ngrudging at first, but, after all, she plays the piano so beautifully.\\r\\nDo tell me, Katharine,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked impulsively, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhere did you go that\\r\\nevening she played Mozart, and you thought I was asleep?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine recollected with difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTo Mary DatchetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she remembered.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Hilbery, with a slight note of disappointment in her\\r\\nvoice. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI had my little romance--my little speculation.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She looked at\\r\\nher daughter. Katharine faltered beneath that innocent and penetrating\\r\\ngaze; she flushed, turned away, and then looked up with very bright\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not in love with Ralph Denham,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t marry unless youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re in love!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Hilbery very quickly.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, glancing momentarily at her daughter, Ã¢\\x80\\x9carenÃ¢\\x80\\x99t there\\r\\ndifferent ways, Katharine--different--?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe want to meet as often as we like, but to be free,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine\\r\\ncontinued.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTo meet here, to meet in his house, to meet in the street.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs.\\r\\nHilbery ran over these phrases as if she were trying chords that did\\r\\nnot quite satisfy her ear. It was plain that she had her sources of\\r\\ninformation, and, indeed, her bag was stuffed with what she called Ã¢\\x80\\x9ckind\\r\\nlettersÃ¢\\x80\\x9d from the pen of her sister-in-law.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. Or to stay away in the country,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine concluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery paused, looked unhappy, and sought inspiration from the\\r\\nwindow.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat a comfort he was in that shop--how he took me and found the ruins\\r\\nat once--how SAFE I felt with him--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSafe? Oh, no, heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s fearfully rash--heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s always taking risks. He wants\\r\\nto throw up his profession and live in a little cottage and write books,\\r\\nthough he hasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t a penny of his own, and there are any number of sisters\\r\\nand brothers dependent on him.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh, he has a mother?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes. Rather a fine-looking old lady, with white hair.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine began\\r\\nto describe her visit, and soon Mrs. Hilbery elicited the facts that not\\r\\nonly was the house of excruciating ugliness, which Ralph bore without\\r\\ncomplaint, but that it was evident that every one depended on him,\\r\\nand he had a room at the top of the house, with a wonderful view over\\r\\nLondon, and a rook.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA wretched old bird in a corner, with half its feathers out,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said,\\r\\nwith a tenderness in her voice that seemed to commiserate the sufferings\\r\\nof humanity while resting assured in the capacity of Ralph Denham to\\r\\nalleviate them, so that Mrs. Hilbery could not help exclaiming:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut, Katharine, you ARE in love!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d at which Katharine flushed, looked\\r\\nstartled, as if she had said something that she ought not to have said,\\r\\nand shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nHastily Mrs. Hilbery asked for further details of this extraordinary\\r\\nhouse, and interposed a few speculations about the meeting between Keats\\r\\nand Coleridge in a lane, which tided over the discomfort of the moment,\\r\\nand drew Katharine on to further descriptions and indiscretions. In\\r\\ntruth, she found an extraordinary pleasure in being thus free to talk to\\r\\nsome one who was equally wise and equally benignant, the mother of her\\r\\nearliest childhood, whose silence seemed to answer questions that were\\r\\nnever asked. Mrs. Hilbery listened without making any remark for a\\r\\nconsiderable time. She seemed to draw her conclusions rather by looking\\r\\nat her daughter than by listening to her, and, if cross-examined, she\\r\\nwould probably have given a highly inaccurate version of Ralph DenhamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nlife-history except that he was penniless, fatherless, and lived at\\r\\nHighgate--all of which was much in his favor. But by means of these\\r\\nfurtive glances she had assured herself that Katharine was in a state\\r\\nwhich gave her, alternately, the most exquisite pleasure and the most\\r\\nprofound alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe could not help ejaculating at last:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all done in five minutes at a Registry Office nowadays, if you\\r\\nthink the Church service a little florid--which it is, though there are\\r\\nnoble things in it.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut we donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want to be married,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine replied emphatically, and\\r\\nadded, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy, after all, isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t it perfectly possible to live together\\r\\nwithout being married?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain Mrs. Hilbery looked discomposed, and, in her trouble, took up the\\r\\nsheets which were lying upon the table, and began turning them over this\\r\\nway and that, and muttering to herself as she glanced:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cA plus B minus C equals Ã¢\\x80\\x98x y zÃ¢\\x80\\x99. ItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s so dreadfully ugly, Katharine.\\r\\nThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s what I feel--so dreadfully ugly.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine took the sheets from her motherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s hand and began shuffling\\r\\nthem absent-mindedly together, for her fixed gaze seemed to show that\\r\\nher thoughts were intent upon some other matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know about ugliness,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said at length.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut he doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t ask it of you?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cNot that grave\\r\\nyoung man with the steady brown eyes?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cHe doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t ask anything--we neither of us ask anything.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIf I could help you, Katharine, by the memory of what I felt--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, tell me what you felt.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery, her eyes growing blank, peered down the enormously long\\r\\ncorridor of days at the far end of which the little figures of herself\\r\\nand her husband appeared fantastically attired, clasping hands upon a\\r\\nmoonlit beach, with roses swinging in the dusk.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe were in a little boat going out to a ship at night,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she began. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cThe\\r\\nsun had set and the moon was rising over our heads. There were lovely\\r\\nsilver lights upon the waves and three green lights upon the steamer in\\r\\nthe middle of the bay. Your fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s head looked so grand against the\\r\\nmast. It was life, it was death. The great sea was round us. It was the\\r\\nvoyage for ever and ever.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ancient fairy-tale fell roundly and harmoniously upon KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nears. Yes, there was the enormous space of the sea; there were the three\\r\\ngreen lights upon the steamer; the cloaked figures climbed up on deck.\\r\\nAnd so, voyaging over the green and purple waters, past the cliffs and\\r\\nthe sandy lagoons and through pools crowded with the masts of ships\\r\\nand the steeples of churches--here they were. The river seemed to have\\r\\nbrought them and deposited them here at this precise point. She looked\\r\\nadmiringly at her mother, that ancient voyager.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWho knows,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery, continuing her reveries, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhere we\\r\\nare bound for, or why, or who has sent us, or what we shall find--who\\r\\nknows anything, except that love is our faith--love--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she crooned, and\\r\\nthe soft sound beating through the dim words was heard by her daughter\\r\\nas the breaking of waves solemnly in order upon the vast shore that she\\r\\ngazed upon. She would have been content for her mother to repeat that\\r\\nword almost indefinitely--a soothing word when uttered by another, a\\r\\nriveting together of the shattered fragments of the world. But Mrs.\\r\\nHilbery, instead of repeating the word love, said pleadingly:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd you wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t think those ugly thoughts again, will you, Katharine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d at\\r\\nwhich words the ship which Katharine had been considering seemed to put\\r\\ninto harbor and have done with its seafaring. Yet she was in great need,\\r\\nif not exactly of sympathy, of some form of advice, or, at least, of the\\r\\nopportunity of setting forth her problems before a third person so as to\\r\\nrenew them in her own eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut then,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, ignoring the difficult problem of ugliness, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cyou\\r\\nknew you were in love; but weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re different. It seems,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued,\\r\\nfrowning a little as she tried to fix the difficult feeling, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cas if\\r\\nsomething came to an end suddenly--gave out--faded--an illusion--as\\r\\nif when we think weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re in love we make it up--we imagine what doesnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nexist. ThatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s why itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s impossible that we should ever marry. Always to\\r\\nbe finding the other an illusion, and going off and forgetting about\\r\\nthem, never to be certain that you cared, or that he wasnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t caring for\\r\\nsome one not you at all, the horror of changing from one state to the\\r\\nother, being happy one moment and miserable the next--thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the reason\\r\\nwhy we canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t possibly marry. At the same time,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she continued, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwe canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nlive without each other, because--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery waited patiently for\\r\\nthe sentence to be completed, but Katharine fell silent and fingered her\\r\\nsheet of figures.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWe have to have faith in our vision,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery resumed, glancing\\r\\nat the figures, which distressed her vaguely, and had some connection in\\r\\nher mind with the household accounts, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cotherwise, as you say--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She\\r\\ncast a lightning glance into the depths of disillusionment which were,\\r\\nperhaps, not altogether unknown to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBelieve me, Katharine, itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the same for every one--for me, too--for\\r\\nyour father,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said earnestly, and sighed. They looked together into\\r\\nthe abyss and, as the elder of the two, she recovered herself first and\\r\\nasked:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut where is Ralph? Why isnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t he here to see me?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s expression changed instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBecause heÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not allowed to come here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied bitterly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery brushed this aside.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWould there be time to send for him before luncheon?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine looked at her as if, indeed, she were some magician. Once\\r\\nmore she felt that instead of being a grown woman, used to advise and\\r\\ncommand, she was only a foot or two raised above the long grass and the\\r\\nlittle flowers and entirely dependent upon the figure of indefinite size\\r\\nwhose head went up into the sky, whose hand was in hers, for guidance.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m not happy without him,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said simply.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery nodded her head in a manner which indicated complete\\r\\nunderstanding, and the immediate conception of certain plans for the\\r\\nfuture. She swept up her flowers, breathed in their sweetness, and,\\r\\nhumming a little song about a millerÃ¢\\x80\\x99s daughter, left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe case upon which Ralph Denham was engaged that afternoon was not\\r\\napparently receiving his full attention, and yet the affairs of the late\\r\\nJohn Leake of Dublin were sufficiently confused to need all the care\\r\\nthat a solicitor could bestow upon them, if the widow Leake and the five\\r\\nLeake children of tender age were to receive any pittance at all. But\\r\\nthe appeal to RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s humanity had little chance of being heard to-day;\\r\\nhe was no longer a model of concentration. The partition so carefully\\r\\nerected between the different sections of his life had been broken down,\\r\\nwith the result that though his eyes were fixed upon the last Will and\\r\\nTestament, he saw through the page a certain drawing-room in Cheyne\\r\\nWalk.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tried every device that had proved effective in the past for keeping\\r\\nup the partitions of the mind, until he could decently go home; but a\\r\\nlittle to his alarm he found himself assailed so persistently, as if\\r\\nfrom outside, by Katharine, that he launched forth desperately into an\\r\\nimaginary interview with her. She obliterated a bookcase full of law\\r\\nreports, and the corners and lines of the room underwent a curious\\r\\nsoftening of outline like that which sometimes makes a room unfamiliar\\r\\nat the moment of waking from sleep. By degrees, a pulse or stress began\\r\\nto beat at regular intervals in his mind, heaping his thoughts into\\r\\nwaves to which words fitted themselves, and without much consciousness\\r\\nof what he was doing, he began to write on a sheet of draft paper what\\r\\nhad the appearance of a poem lacking several words in each line. Not\\r\\nmany lines had been set down, however, before he threw away his pen as\\r\\nviolently as if that were responsible for his misdeeds, and tore the\\r\\npaper into many separate pieces. This was a sign that Katharine\\r\\nhad asserted herself and put to him a remark that could not be met\\r\\npoetically. Her remark was entirely destructive of poetry, since it was\\r\\nto the effect that poetry had nothing whatever to do with her; all\\r\\nher friends spent their lives in making up phrases, she said; all his\\r\\nfeeling was an illusion, and next moment, as if to taunt him with his\\r\\nimpotence, she had sunk into one of those dreamy states which took no\\r\\naccount whatever of his existence. Ralph was roused by his passionate\\r\\nattempts to attract her attention to the fact that he was standing\\r\\nin the middle of his little private room in LincolnÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Inn Fields at a\\r\\nconsiderable distance from Chelsea. The physical distance increased his\\r\\ndesperation. He began pacing in circles until the process sickened him,\\r\\nand then took a sheet of paper for the composition of a letter which, he\\r\\nvowed before he began it, should be sent that same evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a difficult matter to put into words; poetry would have done it\\r\\nbetter justice, but he must abstain from poetry. In an infinite number\\r\\nof half-obliterated scratches he tried to convey to her the possibility\\r\\nthat although human beings are woefully ill-adapted for communication,\\r\\nstill, such communion is the best we know; moreover, they make it\\r\\npossible for each to have access to another world independent of\\r\\npersonal affairs, a world of law, of philosophy, or more strangely a\\r\\nworld such as he had had a glimpse of the other evening when together\\r\\nthey seemed to be sharing something, creating something, an ideal--a\\r\\nvision flung out in advance of our actual circumstances. If this golden\\r\\nrim were quenched, if life were no longer circled by an illusion (but\\r\\nwas it an illusion after all?), then it would be too dismal an affair\\r\\nto carry to an end; so he wrote with a sudden spurt of conviction which\\r\\nmade clear way for a space and left at least one sentence standing\\r\\nwhole. Making every allowance for other desires, on the whole this\\r\\nconclusion appeared to him to justify their relationship. But the\\r\\nconclusion was mystical; it plunged him into thought. The difficulty\\r\\nwith which even this amount was written, the inadequacy of the words,\\r\\nand the need of writing under them and over them others which, after\\r\\nall, did no better, led him to leave off before he was at all satisfied\\r\\nwith his production, and unable to resist the conviction that such\\r\\nrambling would never be fit for KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eye. He felt himself more\\r\\ncut off from her than ever. In idleness, and because he could do nothing\\r\\nfurther with words, he began to draw little figures in the blank spaces,\\r\\nheads meant to resemble her head, blots fringed with flames meant to\\r\\nrepresent--perhaps the entire universe. From this occupation he was\\r\\nroused by the message that a lady wished to speak to him. He had\\r\\nscarcely time to run his hands through his hair in order to look as much\\r\\nlike a solicitor as possible, and to cram his papers into his pocket,\\r\\nalready overcome with shame that another eye should behold them, when he\\r\\nrealized that his preparations were needless. The lady was Mrs. Hilbery.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI hope youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re not disposing of somebodyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s fortune in a hurry,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nremarked, gazing at the documents on his table, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cor cutting off an\\r\\nentail at one blow, because I want to ask you to do me a favor. And\\r\\nAnderson wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t keep his horse waiting. (Anderson is a perfect tyrant,\\r\\nbut he drove my dear father to the Abbey the day they buried him.) I\\r\\nmade bold to come to you, Mr. Denham, not exactly in search of legal\\r\\nassistance (though I donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t know who IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d rather come to, if I were in\\r\\ntrouble), but in order to ask your help in settling some tiresome\\r\\nlittle domestic affairs that have arisen in my absence. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been to\\r\\nStratford-on-Avon (I must tell you all about that one of these days),\\r\\nand there I got a letter from my sister-in-law, a dear kind goose who\\r\\nlikes interfering with other peopleÃ¢\\x80\\x99s children because sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s got none of\\r\\nher own. (WeÃ¢\\x80\\x99re dreadfully afraid that sheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s going to lose the sight of\\r\\none of her eyes, and I always feel that our physical ailments are so apt\\r\\nto turn into mental ailments. I think Matthew Arnold says something of\\r\\nthe same kind about Lord Byron.) But thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s neither here nor there.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effect of these parentheses, whether they were introduced for that\\r\\npurpose or represented a natural instinct on Mrs. HilberyÃ¢\\x80\\x99s part to\\r\\nembellish the bareness of her discourse, gave Ralph time to perceive\\r\\nthat she possessed all the facts of their situation and was come,\\r\\nsomehow, in the capacity of ambassador.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t come here to talk about Lord Byron,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery continued,\\r\\nwith a little laugh, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cthough I know that both you and Katharine, unlike\\r\\nother young people of your generation, still find him worth reading.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n She paused. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99m so glad youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve made Katharine read poetry, Mr. Denham!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she exclaimed, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cand feel poetry, and look poetry! She canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t talk it yet,\\r\\nbut she will--oh, she will!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph, whose hand was grasped and whose tongue almost refused to\\r\\narticulate, somehow contrived to say that there were moments when he\\r\\nfelt hopeless, utterly hopeless, though he gave no reason for this\\r\\nstatement on his part.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut you care for her?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGood God!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed, with a vehemence which admitted of no\\r\\nquestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the Church of England service you both object to?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery\\r\\ninquired innocently.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t care a damn what service it is,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou would marry her in Westminster Abbey if the worst came to the\\r\\nworst?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI would marry her in St. PaulÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Cathedral,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph replied. His doubts\\r\\nupon this point, which were always roused by KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s presence, had\\r\\nvanished completely, and his strongest wish in the world was to be with\\r\\nher immediately, since every second he was away from her he imagined her\\r\\nslipping farther and farther from him into one of those states of mind\\r\\nin which he was unrepresented. He wished to dominate her, to possess\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThank God!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery. She thanked Him for a variety of\\r\\nblessings: for the conviction with which the young man spoke; and not\\r\\nleast for the prospect that on her daughterÃ¢\\x80\\x99s wedding-day the noble\\r\\ncadences, the stately periods, the ancient eloquence of the marriage\\r\\nservice would resound over the heads of a distinguished congregation\\r\\ngathered together near the very spot where her father lay quiescent\\r\\nwith the other poets of England. The tears filled her eyes; but she\\r\\nremembered simultaneously that her carriage was waiting, and with dim\\r\\neyes she walked to the door. Denham followed her downstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a strange drive. For Denham it was without exception the most\\r\\nunpleasant he had ever taken. His only wish was to go as straightly\\r\\nand quickly as possible to Cheyne Walk; but it soon appeared that\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery either ignored or thought fit to baffle this desire by\\r\\ninterposing various errands of her own. She stopped the carriage at\\r\\npost-offices, and coffee-shops, and shops of inscrutable dignity where\\r\\nthe aged attendants had to be greeted as old friends; and, catching\\r\\nsight of the dome of St. PaulÃ¢\\x80\\x99s above the irregular spires of Ludgate\\r\\nHill, she pulled the cord impulsively, and gave directions that Anderson\\r\\nshould drive them there. But Anderson had reasons of his own for\\r\\ndiscouraging afternoon worship, and kept his horseÃ¢\\x80\\x99s nose obstinately\\r\\ntowards the west. After some minutes, Mrs. Hilbery realized the\\r\\nsituation, and accepted it good-humoredly, apologizing to Ralph for his\\r\\ndisappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNever mind,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cweÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll go to St. PaulÃ¢\\x80\\x99s another day, and it may\\r\\nturn out, though I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t promise that it WILL, that heÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll take us past\\r\\nWestminster Abbey, which would be even better.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph was scarcely aware of what she went on to say. Her mind and body\\r\\nboth seemed to have floated into another region of quick-sailing\\r\\nclouds rapidly passing across each other and enveloping everything in\\r\\na vaporous indistinctness. Meanwhile he remained conscious of his own\\r\\nconcentrated desire, his impotence to bring about anything he wished,\\r\\nand his increasing agony of impatience.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Mrs. Hilbery pulled the cord with such decision that even\\r\\nAnderson had to listen to the order which she leant out of the window\\r\\nto give him. The carriage pulled up abruptly in the middle of Whitehall\\r\\nbefore a large building dedicated to one of our Government offices. In\\r\\na second Mrs. Hilbery was mounting the steps, and Ralph was left in too\\r\\nacute an irritation by this further delay even to speculate what errand\\r\\ntook her now to the Board of Education. He was about to jump from the\\r\\ncarriage and take a cab, when Mrs. Hilbery reappeared talking genially\\r\\nto a figure who remained hidden behind her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s plenty of room for us all,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she was saying. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cPlenty of room. We\\r\\ncould find space for FOUR of you, William,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added, opening the door,\\r\\nand Ralph found that Rodney had now joined their company. The two men\\r\\nglanced at each other. If distress, shame, discomfort in its most acute\\r\\nform were ever visible upon a human face, Ralph could read them all\\r\\nexpressed beyond the eloquence of words upon the face of his unfortunate\\r\\ncompanion. But Mrs. Hilbery was either completely unseeing or determined\\r\\nto appear so. She went on talking; she talked, it seemed to both\\r\\nthe young men, to some one outside, up in the air. She talked about\\r\\nShakespeare, she apostrophized the human race, she proclaimed the\\r\\nvirtues of divine poetry, she began to recite verses which broke down\\r\\nin the middle. The great advantage of her discourse was that it was\\r\\nself-supporting. It nourished itself until Cheyne Walk was reached upon\\r\\nhalf a dozen grunts and murmurs.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNow,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, alighting briskly at her door, Ã¢\\x80\\x9chere we are!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was something airy and ironical in her voice and expression as she\\r\\nturned upon the doorstep and looked at them, which filled both Rodney\\r\\nand Denham with the same misgivings at having trusted their fortunes to\\r\\nsuch an ambassador; and Rodney actually hesitated upon the threshold and\\r\\nmurmured to Denham:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou go in, Denham. I...Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He was turning tail, but the door opening and\\r\\nthe familiar look of the house asserting its charm, he bolted in on the\\r\\nwake of the others, and the door shut upon his escape. Mrs. Hilbery led\\r\\nthe way upstairs. She took them to the drawing-room. The fire burnt\\r\\nas usual, the little tables were laid with china and silver. There was\\r\\nnobody there.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAh,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cKatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s not here. She must be upstairs in her room.\\r\\nYou have something to say to her, I know, Mr. Denham. You can find your\\r\\nway?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she vaguely indicated the ceiling with a gesture of her hand. She\\r\\nhad become suddenly serious and composed, mistress in her own house.\\r\\nThe gesture with which she dismissed him had a dignity that Ralph never\\r\\nforgot. She seemed to make him free with a wave of her hand to all that\\r\\nshe possessed. He left the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe HilberysÃ¢\\x80\\x99 house was tall, possessing many stories and passages with\\r\\nclosed doors, all, once he had passed the drawing-room floor, unknown to\\r\\nRalph. He mounted as high as he could and knocked at the first door he\\r\\ncame to.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMay I come in?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nA voice from within answered Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYes.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was conscious of a large window, full of light, of a bare table, and\\r\\nof a long looking-glass. Katharine had risen, and was standing with some\\r\\nwhite papers in her hand, which slowly fluttered to the ground as\\r\\nshe saw her visitor. The explanation was a short one. The sounds were\\r\\ninarticulate; no one could have understood the meaning save themselves.\\r\\nAs if the forces of the world were all at work to tear them asunder they\\r\\nsat, clasping hands, near enough to be taken even by the malicious eye\\r\\nof Time himself for a united couple, an indivisible unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t move, donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t go,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she begged of him, when he stooped to gather the\\r\\npapers she had let fall. But he took them in his hands and, giving her\\r\\nby a sudden impulse his own unfinished dissertation, with its mystical\\r\\nconclusion, they read each otherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s compositions in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine read his sheets to an end; Ralph followed her figures as far\\r\\nas his mathematics would let him. They came to the end of their tasks at\\r\\nabout the same moment, and sat for a time in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThose were the papers you left on the seat at Kew,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph at\\r\\nlength. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou folded them so quickly that I couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t see what they were.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe blushed very deeply; but as she did not move or attempt to hide her\\r\\nface she had the appearance of some one disarmed of all defences, or\\r\\nRalph likened her to a wild bird just settling with wings trembling to\\r\\nfold themselves within reach of his hand. The moment of exposure had\\r\\nbeen exquisitely painful--the light shed startlingly vivid. She had\\r\\nnow to get used to the fact that some one shared her loneliness. The\\r\\nbewilderment was half shame and half the prelude to profound rejoicing.\\r\\nNor was she unconscious that on the surface the whole thing must appear\\r\\nof the utmost absurdity. She looked to see whether Ralph smiled, but\\r\\nfound his gaze fixed on her with such gravity that she turned to the\\r\\nbelief that she had committed no sacrilege but enriched herself, perhaps\\r\\nimmeasurably, perhaps eternally. She hardly dared steep herself in the\\r\\ninfinite bliss. But his glance seemed to ask for some assurance upon\\r\\nanother point of vital interest to him. It beseeched her mutely to tell\\r\\nhim whether what she had read upon his confused sheet had any meaning or\\r\\ntruth to her. She bent her head once more to the papers she held.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI like your little dot with the flames round it,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said\\r\\nmeditatively.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph nearly tore the page from her hand in shame and despair when he\\r\\nsaw her actually contemplating the idiotic symbol of his most confused\\r\\nand emotional moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was convinced that it could mean nothing to another, although somehow\\r\\nto him it conveyed not only Katharine herself but all those states of\\r\\nmind which had clustered round her since he first saw her pouring\\r\\nout tea on a Sunday afternoon. It represented by its circumference of\\r\\nsmudges surrounding a central blot all that encircling glow which for\\r\\nhim surrounded, inexplicably, so many of the objects of life, softening\\r\\ntheir sharp outline, so that he could see certain streets, books, and\\r\\nsituations wearing a halo almost perceptible to the physical eye. Did\\r\\nshe smile? Did she put the paper down wearily, condemning it not only\\r\\nfor its inadequacy but for its falsity? Was she going to protest once\\r\\nmore that he only loved the vision of her? But it did not occur to her\\r\\nthat this diagram had anything to do with her. She said simply, and in\\r\\nthe same tone of reflection:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, the world looks something like that to me too.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe received her assurance with profound joy. Quietly and steadily there\\r\\nrose up behind the whole aspect of life that soft edge of fire which\\r\\ngave its red tint to the atmosphere and crowded the scene with shadows\\r\\nso deep and dark that one could fancy pushing farther into their\\r\\ndensity and still farther, exploring indefinitely. Whether there was any\\r\\ncorrespondence between the two prospects now opening before them\\r\\nthey shared the same sense of the impending future, vast, mysterious,\\r\\ninfinitely stored with undeveloped shapes which each would unwrap for\\r\\nthe other to behold; but for the present the prospect of the future was\\r\\nenough to fill them with silent adoration. At any rate, their further\\r\\nattempts to communicate articulately were interrupted by a knock on\\r\\nthe door, and the entrance of a maid who, with a due sense of mystery,\\r\\nannounced that a lady wished to see Miss Hilbery, but refused to allow\\r\\nher name to be given.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Katharine rose, with a profound sigh, to resume her duties, Ralph\\r\\nwent with her, and neither of them formulated any guess, on their way\\r\\ndownstairs, as to who this anonymous lady might prove to be. Perhaps the\\r\\nfantastic notion that she was a little black hunchback provided with a\\r\\nsteel knife, which she would plunge into KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s heart, appeared\\r\\nto Ralph more probable than another, and he pushed first into the\\r\\ndining-room to avert the blow. Then he exclaimed Ã¢\\x80\\x9cCassandra!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d with such\\r\\nheartiness at the sight of Cassandra Otway standing by the dining-room\\r\\ntable that she put her finger to her lips and begged him to be quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNobody must know IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m here,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she explained in a sepulchral whisper. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nmissed my train. I have been wandering about London all day. I can bear\\r\\nit no longer. Katharine, what am I to do?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine pushed forward a chair; Ralph hastily found wine and poured it\\r\\nout for her. If not actually fainting, she was very near it.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWilliamÃ¢\\x80\\x99s upstairs,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph, as soon as she appeared to be\\r\\nrecovered. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll go and ask him to come down to you.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d His own happiness\\r\\nhad given him a confidence that every one else was bound to be happy\\r\\ntoo. But Cassandra had her uncleÃ¢\\x80\\x99s commands and anger too vividly in her\\r\\nmind to dare any such defiance. She became agitated and said that she\\r\\nmust leave the house at once. She was not in a condition to go, had they\\r\\nknown where to send her. KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s common sense, which had been in\\r\\nabeyance for the past week or two, still failed her, and she could\\r\\nonly ask, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut whereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s your luggage?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d in the vague belief that to take\\r\\nlodgings depended entirely upon a sufficiency of luggage. CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nreply, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve lost my luggage,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d in no way helped her to a conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve lost your luggage,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she repeated. Her eyes rested upon Ralph,\\r\\nwith an expression which seemed better fitted to accompany a profound\\r\\nthanksgiving for his existence or some vow of eternal devotion than a\\r\\nquestion about luggage. Cassandra perceived the look, and saw that it\\r\\nwas returned; her eyes filled with tears. She faltered in what she was\\r\\nsaying. She began bravely again to discuss the question of lodging when\\r\\nKatharine, who seemed to have communicated silently with Ralph, and\\r\\nobtained his permission, took her ruby ring from her finger and\\r\\ngiving it to Cassandra, said: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI believe it will fit you without any\\r\\nalteration.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words would not have been enough to convince Cassandra of what she\\r\\nvery much wished to believe had not Ralph taken the bare hand in his and\\r\\ndemanded:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t you tell us youÃ¢\\x80\\x99re glad?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra was so glad that the\\r\\ntears ran down her cheeks. The certainty of KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s engagement not\\r\\nonly relieved her of a thousand vague fears and self-reproaches, but\\r\\nentirely quenched that spirit of criticism which had lately impaired\\r\\nher belief in Katharine. Her old faith came back to her. She seemed to\\r\\nbehold her with that curious intensity which she had lost; as a being\\r\\nwho walks just beyond our sphere, so that life in their presence is a\\r\\nheightened process, illuminating not only ourselves but a considerable\\r\\nstretch of the surrounding world. Next moment she contrasted her own lot\\r\\nwith theirs and gave back the ring.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t take that unless William gives it me himself,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cKeep\\r\\nit for me, Katharine.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI assure you everythingÃ¢\\x80\\x99s perfectly all right,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cLet me\\r\\ntell William--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was about, in spite of CassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s protest, to reach the door, when\\r\\nMrs. Hilbery, either warned by the parlor-maid or conscious with her\\r\\nusual prescience of the need for her intervention, opened the door and\\r\\nsmilingly surveyed them.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cMy dear Cassandra!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow delightful to see you back\\r\\nagain! What a coincidence!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she observed, in a general way. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWilliam is\\r\\nupstairs. The kettle boils over. WhereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s Katharine, I say? I go to look,\\r\\nand I find Cassandra!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d She seemed to have proved something to her own\\r\\nsatisfaction, although nobody felt certain what thing precisely it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI find Cassandra,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cShe missed her train,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katharine interposed, seeing that Cassandra was\\r\\nunable to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cLife,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d began Mrs. Hilbery, drawing inspiration from the portraits on\\r\\nthe wall apparently, Ã¢\\x80\\x9cconsists in missing trains and in finding--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d But\\r\\nshe pulled herself up and remarked that the kettle must have boiled\\r\\ncompletely over everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s agitated mind it appeared that this kettle was an\\r\\nenormous kettle, capable of deluging the house in its incessant showers\\r\\nof steam, the enraged representative of all those household duties which\\r\\nshe had neglected. She ran hastily up to the drawing-room, and the rest\\r\\nfollowed her, for Mrs. Hilbery put her arm round Cassandra and drew her\\r\\nupstairs. They found Rodney observing the kettle with uneasiness but\\r\\nwith such absence of mind that KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s catastrophe was in a fair\\r\\nway to be fulfilled. In putting the matter straight no greetings\\r\\nwere exchanged, but Rodney and Cassandra chose seats as far apart as\\r\\npossible, and sat down with an air of people making a very temporary\\r\\nlodgment. Either Mrs. Hilbery was impervious to their discomfort,\\r\\nor chose to ignore it, or thought it high time that the subject was\\r\\nchanged, for she did nothing but talk about ShakespeareÃ¢\\x80\\x99s tomb.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cSo much earth and so much water and that sublime spirit brooding over\\r\\nit all,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she mused, and went on to sing her strange, half-earthly song\\r\\nof dawns and sunsets, of great poets, and the unchanged spirit of noble\\r\\nloving which they had taught, so that nothing changes, and one age is\\r\\nlinked with another, and no one dies, and we all meet in spirit, until\\r\\nshe appeared oblivious of any one in the room. But suddenly her remarks\\r\\nseemed to contract the enormously wide circle in which they were soaring\\r\\nand to alight, airily and temporarily, upon matters of more immediate\\r\\nmoment.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cKatharine and Ralph,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said, as if to try the sound. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWilliam and\\r\\nCassandra.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI feel myself in an entirely false position,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said William desperately,\\r\\nthrusting himself into this breach in her reflections. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve no right to\\r\\nbe sitting here. Mr. Hilbery told me yesterday to leave the house. IÃ¢\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nno intention of coming back again. I shall now--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI feel the same too,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Cassandra interrupted. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cAfter what Uncle Trevor\\r\\nsaid to me last night--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI have put you into a most odious position,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Rodney went on, rising\\r\\nfrom his seat, in which movement he was imitated simultaneously by\\r\\nCassandra. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cUntil I have your fatherÃ¢\\x80\\x99s consent I have no right to\\r\\nspeak to you--let alone in this house, where my conductÃ¢\\x80\\x9d--he looked\\r\\nat Katharine, stammered, and fell silent--Ã¢\\x80\\x9cwhere my conduct has been\\r\\nreprehensible and inexcusable in the extreme,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he forced himself\\r\\nto continue. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI have explained everything to your mother. She is so\\r\\ngenerous as to try and make me believe that I have done no harm--you\\r\\nhave convinced her that my behavior, selfish and weak as it was--selfish\\r\\nand weak--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated, like a speaker who has lost his notes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo emotions seemed to be struggling in Katharine; one the desire to\\r\\nlaugh at the ridiculous spectacle of William making her a formal\\r\\nspeech across the tea-table, the other a desire to weep at the sight of\\r\\nsomething childlike and honest in him which touched her inexpressibly.\\r\\nTo every oneÃ¢\\x80\\x99s surprise she rose, stretched out her hand, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve nothing to reproach yourself with--youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been always--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d but\\r\\nhere her voice died away, and the tears forced themselves into her eyes,\\r\\nand ran down her cheeks, while William, equally moved, seized her hand\\r\\nand pressed it to his lips. No one perceived that the drawing-room door\\r\\nhad opened itself sufficiently to admit at least half the person of\\r\\nMr. Hilbery, or saw him gaze at the scene round the tea-table with an\\r\\nexpression of the utmost disgust and expostulation. He withdrew unseen.\\r\\nHe paused outside on the landing trying to recover his self-control and\\r\\nto decide what course he might with most dignity pursue. It was\\r\\nobvious to him that his wife had entirely confused the meaning of his\\r\\ninstructions. She had plunged them all into the most odious confusion.\\r\\nHe waited a moment, and then, with much preliminary rattling of the\\r\\nhandle, opened the door a second time. They had all regained their\\r\\nplaces; some incident of an absurd nature had now set them laughing\\r\\nand looking under the table, so that his entrance passed momentarily\\r\\nunperceived. Katharine, with flushed cheeks, raised her head and said:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWell, thatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s my last attempt at the dramatic.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s astonishing what a distance they roll,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph, stooping to\\r\\nturn up the corner of the hearthrug.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t trouble--donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t bother. We shall find it--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Hilbery began,\\r\\nand then saw her husband and exclaimed: Ã¢\\x80\\x9cOh, Trevor, weÃ¢\\x80\\x99re looking for\\r\\nCassandraÃ¢\\x80\\x99s engagement-ring!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Hilbery looked instinctively at the carpet. Remarkably enough, the\\r\\nring had rolled to the very point where he stood. He saw the rubies\\r\\ntouching the tip of his boot. Such is the force of habit that he could\\r\\nnot refrain from stooping, with an absurd little thrill of pleasure at\\r\\nbeing the one to find what others were looking for, and, picking the\\r\\nring up, he presented it, with a bow that was courtly in the extreme, to\\r\\nCassandra. Whether the making of a bow released automatically feelings\\r\\nof complaisance and urbanity, Mr. Hilbery found his resentment\\r\\ncompletely washed away during the second in which he bent and\\r\\nstraightened himself. Cassandra dared to offer her cheek and received\\r\\nhis embrace. He nodded with some degree of stiffness to Rodney and\\r\\nDenham, who had both risen upon seeing him, and now altogether sat\\r\\ndown. Mrs. Hilbery seemed to have been waiting for the entrance of her\\r\\nhusband, and for this precise moment in order to put to him a question\\r\\nwhich, from the ardor with which she announced it, had evidently been\\r\\npressing for utterance for some time past.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, Trevor, please tell me, what was the date of the first performance\\r\\nof Ã¢\\x80\\x98HamletÃ¢\\x80\\x99?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to answer her Mr. Hilbery had to have recourse to the exact\\r\\nscholarship of William Rodney, and before he had given his excellent\\r\\nauthorities for believing as he believed, Rodney felt himself admitted\\r\\nonce more to the society of the civilized and sanctioned by the\\r\\nauthority of no less a person than Shakespeare himself. The power of\\r\\nliterature, which had temporarily deserted Mr. Hilbery, now came back to\\r\\nhim, pouring over the raw ugliness of human affairs its soothing\\r\\nbalm, and providing a form into which such passions as he had felt so\\r\\npainfully the night before could be molded so that they fell roundly\\r\\nfrom the tongue in shapely phrases, hurting nobody. He was sufficiently\\r\\nsure of his command of language at length to look at Katharine and again\\r\\nat Denham. All this talk about Shakespeare had acted as a soporific, or\\r\\nrather as an incantation upon Katharine. She leaned back in her chair at\\r\\nthe head of the tea-table, perfectly silent, looking vaguely past\\r\\nthem all, receiving the most generalized ideas of human heads against\\r\\npictures, against yellow-tinted walls, against curtains of deep crimson\\r\\nvelvet. Denham, to whom he turned next, shared her immobility under his\\r\\ngaze. But beneath his restraint and calm it was possible to detect a\\r\\nresolution, a will, set now with unalterable tenacity, which made such\\r\\nturns of speech as Mr. Hilbery had at command appear oddly irrelevant.\\r\\nAt any rate, he said nothing. He respected the young man; he was a very\\r\\nable young man; he was likely to get his own way. He could, he thought,\\r\\nlooking at his still and very dignified head, understand KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npreference, and, as he thought this, he was surprised by a pang of acute\\r\\njealousy. She might have married Rodney without causing him a twinge.\\r\\nThis man she loved. Or what was the state of affairs between them? An\\r\\nextraordinary confusion of emotion was beginning to get the better of\\r\\nhim, when Mrs. Hilbery, who had been conscious of a sudden pause in the\\r\\nconversation, and had looked wistfully at her daughter once or twice,\\r\\nremarked:\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t stay if you want to go, Katharine. ThereÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the little room over\\r\\nthere. Perhaps you and Ralph--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWeÃ¢\\x80\\x99re engaged,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, waking with a start, and looking\\r\\nstraight at her father. He was taken aback by the directness of the\\r\\nstatement; he exclaimed as if an unexpected blow had struck him. Had he\\r\\nloved her to see her swept away by this torrent, to have her taken from\\r\\nhim by this uncontrollable force, to stand by helpless, ignored? Oh, how\\r\\nhe loved her! How he loved her! He nodded very curtly to Denham.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI gathered something of the kind last night,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI hope youÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ndeserve her.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d But he never looked at his daughter, and strode out of the\\r\\nroom, leaving in the minds of the women a sense, half of awe, half of\\r\\namusement, at the extravagant, inconsiderate, uncivilized male, outraged\\r\\nsomehow and gone bellowing to his lair with a roar which still sometimes\\r\\nreverberates in the most polished of drawing-rooms. Then Katharine,\\r\\nlooking at the shut door, looked down again, to hide her tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIV\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lamps were lit; their luster reflected itself in the polished wood;\\r\\ngood wine was passed round the dinner-table; before the meal was far\\r\\nadvanced civilization had triumphed, and Mr. Hilbery presided over\\r\\na feast which came to wear more and more surely an aspect, cheerful,\\r\\ndignified, promising well for the future. To judge from the expression\\r\\nin KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eyes it promised something--but he checked the approach\\r\\nsentimentality. He poured out wine; he bade Denham help himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went upstairs and he saw Katharine and Denham abstract\\r\\nthemselves directly Cassandra had asked whether she might not play him\\r\\nsomething--some Mozart? some Beethoven? She sat down to the piano; the\\r\\ndoor closed softly behind them. His eyes rested on the closed door for\\r\\nsome seconds unwaveringly, but, by degrees, the look of expectation died\\r\\nout of them, and, with a sigh, he listened to the music.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatharine and Ralph were agreed with scarcely a word of discussion as\\r\\nto what they wished to do, and in a moment she joined him in the hall\\r\\ndressed for walking. The night was still and moonlit, fit for walking,\\r\\nthough any night would have seemed so to them, desiring more than\\r\\nanything movement, freedom from scrutiny, silence, and the open air.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAt last!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she breathed, as the front door shut. She told him how she\\r\\nhad waited, fidgeted, thought he was never coming, listened for the\\r\\nsound of doors, half expected to see him again under the lamp-post,\\r\\nlooking at the house. They turned and looked at the serene front with\\r\\nits gold-rimmed windows, to him the shrine of so much adoration. In\\r\\nspite of her laugh and the little pressure of mockery on his arm, he\\r\\nwould not resign his belief, but with her hand resting there, her voice\\r\\nquickened and mysteriously moving in his ears, he had not time--they had\\r\\nnot the same inclination--other objects drew his attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow they came to find themselves walking down a street with many lamps,\\r\\ncorners radiant with light, and a steady succession of motor-omnibuses\\r\\nplying both ways along it, they could neither of them tell; nor account\\r\\nfor the impulse which led them suddenly to select one of these wayfarers\\r\\nand mount to the very front seat. After curving through streets of\\r\\ncomparative darkness, so narrow that shadows on the blinds were pressed\\r\\nwithin a few feet of their faces, they came to one of those great knots\\r\\nof activity where the lights, having drawn close together, thin out\\r\\nagain and take their separate ways. They were borne on until they saw\\r\\nthe spires of the city churches pale and flat against the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAre you cold?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked, as they stopped by Temple Bar.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYes, I am rather,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied, becoming conscious that the splendid\\r\\nrace of lights drawn past her eyes by the superb curving and swerving of\\r\\nthe monster on which she sat was at an end. They had followed some such\\r\\ncourse in their thoughts too; they had been borne on, victors in the\\r\\nforefront of some triumphal car, spectators of a pageant enacted\\r\\nfor them, masters of life. But standing on the pavement alone, this\\r\\nexaltation left them; they were glad to be alone together. Ralph stood\\r\\nstill for a moment to light his pipe beneath a lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at his face isolated in the little circle of light.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOh, that cottage,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWe must take it and go there.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAnd leave all this?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cAs you like,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied. She thought, looking at the sky above\\r\\nChancery Lane, how the roof was the same everywhere; how she was now\\r\\nsecure of all that this lofty blue and its steadfast lights meant to\\r\\nher; reality, was it, figures, love, truth?\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve something on my mind,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph abruptly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI mean IÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve been\\r\\nthinking of Mary Datchet. WeÃ¢\\x80\\x99re very near her rooms now. Would you mind\\r\\nif we went there?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had turned before she answered him. She had no wish to see any one\\r\\nto-night; it seemed to her that the immense riddle was answered; the\\r\\nproblem had been solved; she held in her hands for one brief moment the\\r\\nglobe which we spend our lives in trying to shape, round, whole,\\r\\nand entire from the confusion of chaos. To see Mary was to risk the\\r\\ndestruction of this globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDid you treat her badly?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked rather mechanically, walking on.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI could defend myself,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said, almost defiantly. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cBut whatÃ¢\\x80\\x99s the use,\\r\\nif one feels a thing? I wonÃ¢\\x80\\x99t be with her a minute,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cIÃ¢\\x80\\x99ll just\\r\\ntell her--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cOf course, you must tell her,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Katharine, and now felt anxious\\r\\nfor him to do what appeared to be necessary if he, too, were to hold his\\r\\nglobe for a moment round, whole, and entire.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI wish--I wish--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she sighed, for melancholy came over her and obscured\\r\\nat least a section of her clear vision. The globe swam before her as if\\r\\nobscured by tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI regret nothing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph firmly. She leant towards him almost as\\r\\nif she could thus see what he saw. She thought how obscure he still was\\r\\nto her, save only that more and more constantly he appeared to her a\\r\\nfire burning through its smoke, a source of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGo on,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she said. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cYou regret nothing--Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNothing--nothing,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat a fire!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought to herself. She thought of him blazing\\r\\nsplendidly in the night, yet so obscure that to hold his arm, as she\\r\\nheld it, was only to touch the opaque substance surrounding the flame\\r\\nthat roared upwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhy nothing?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked hurriedly, in order that he might say more and\\r\\nso make more splendid, more red, more darkly intertwined with smoke this\\r\\nflame rushing upwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat are you thinking of, Katharine?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked suspiciously, noticing\\r\\nher tone of dreaminess and the inapt words.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI was thinking of you--yes, I swear it. Always of you, but you take\\r\\nsuch strange shapes in my mind. YouÃ¢\\x80\\x99ve destroyed my loneliness. Am I to\\r\\ntell you how I see you? No, tell me--tell me from the beginning.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning with spasmodic words, he went on to speak more and more\\r\\nfluently, more and more passionately, feeling her leaning towards him,\\r\\nlistening with wonder like a child, with gratitude like a woman. She\\r\\ninterrupted him gravely now and then.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut it was foolish to stand outside and look at the windows. Suppose\\r\\nWilliam hadnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t seen you. Would you have gone to bed?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe capped her reproof with wonderment that a woman of her age could have\\r\\nstood in Kingsway looking at the traffic until she forgot.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cBut it was then I first knew I loved you!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cTell me from the beginning,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he begged her.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cNo, IÃ¢\\x80\\x99m a person who canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t tell things,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she pleaded. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cI shall say\\r\\nsomething ridiculous--something about flames--fires. No, I canÃ¢\\x80\\x99t tell\\r\\nyou.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he persuaded her into a broken statement, beautiful to him, charged\\r\\nwith extreme excitement as she spoke of the dark red fire, and the smoke\\r\\ntwined round it, making him feel that he had stepped over the threshold\\r\\ninto the faintly lit vastness of another mind, stirring with shapes,\\r\\nso large, so dim, unveiling themselves only in flashes, and moving away\\r\\nagain into the darkness, engulfed by it. They had walked by this time\\r\\nto the street in which Mary lived, and being engrossed by what they said\\r\\nand partly saw, passed her staircase without looking up. At this time\\r\\nof night there was no traffic and scarcely any foot-passengers, so that\\r\\nthey could pace slowly without interruption, arm-in-arm, raising their\\r\\nhands now and then to draw something upon the vast blue curtain of the\\r\\nsky.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey brought themselves by these means, acting on a mood of profound\\r\\nhappiness, to a state of clear-sightedness where the lifting of a finger\\r\\nhad effect, and one word spoke more than a sentence. They lapsed gently\\r\\ninto silence, traveling the dark paths of thought side by side towards\\r\\nsomething discerned in the distance which gradually possessed them both.\\r\\nThey were victors, masters of life, but at the same time absorbed in the\\r\\nflame, giving their life to increase its brightness, to testify to their\\r\\nfaith. Thus they had walked, perhaps, twice or three times up and down\\r\\nMary DatchetÃ¢\\x80\\x99s street before the recurrence of a light burning behind a\\r\\nthin, yellow blind caused them to stop without exactly knowing why they\\r\\ndid so. It burned itself into their minds.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cThat is the light in MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s room,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d said Ralph. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe must be at home.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n He pointed across the street. KatharineÃ¢\\x80\\x99s eyes rested there too.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cIs she alone, working at this time of night? What is she working at?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n she wondered. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cWhy should we interrupt her?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she asked passionately.\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cWhat have we got to give her? SheÃ¢\\x80\\x99s happy too,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she added. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cShe has\\r\\nher work.Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Her voice shook slightly, and the light swam like an ocean of\\r\\ngold behind her tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYou donÃ¢\\x80\\x99t want me to go to her?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Ralph asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cGo, if you like; tell her what you like,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe crossed the road immediately, and went up the steps into MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhouse. Katharine stood where he left her, looking at the window and\\r\\nexpecting soon to see a shadow move across it; but she saw nothing; the\\r\\nblinds conveyed nothing; the light was not moved. It signaled to her\\r\\nacross the dark street; it was a sign of triumph shining there for\\r\\never, not to be extinguished this side of the grave. She brandished her\\r\\nhappiness as if in salute; she dipped it as if in reverence. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cHow they\\r\\nburn!Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she thought, and all the darkness of London seemed set with\\r\\nfires, roaring upwards; but her eyes came back to MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s window and\\r\\nrested there satisfied. She had waited some time before a figure\\r\\ndetached itself from the doorway and came across the road, slowly and\\r\\nreluctantly, to where she stood.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cI didnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t go in--I couldnÃ¢\\x80\\x99t bring myself,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he broke off. He had stood\\r\\noutside MaryÃ¢\\x80\\x99s door unable to bring himself to knock; if she had come\\r\\nout she would have found him there, the tears running down his cheeks,\\r\\nunable to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stood for some moments, looking at the illuminated blinds, an\\r\\nexpression to them both of something impersonal and serene in the spirit\\r\\nof the woman within, working out her plans far into the night--her plans\\r\\nfor the good of a world that none of them were ever to know. Then their\\r\\nminds jumped on and other little figures came by in procession, headed,\\r\\nin RalphÃ¢\\x80\\x99s view, by the figure of Sally Seal.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cDo you remember Sally Seal?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he asked. Katharine bent her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cYour mother and Mary?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he went on. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cRodney and Cassandra? Old Joan up\\r\\nat Highgate?Ã¢\\x80\\x9d He stopped in his enumeration, not finding it possible to\\r\\nlink them together in any way that should explain the queer combination\\r\\nwhich he could perceive in them, as he thought of them. They appeared to\\r\\nhim to be more than individuals; to be made up of many different things\\r\\nin cohesion; he had a vision of an orderly world.\\r\\n\\r\\nÃ¢\\x80\\x9cItÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all so easy--itÃ¢\\x80\\x99s all so simple,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d Katherine quoted, remembering\\r\\nsome words of Sally SealÃ¢\\x80\\x99s, and wishing Ralph to understand that she\\r\\nfollowed the track of his thought. She felt him trying to piece together\\r\\nin a laborious and elementary fashion fragments of belief, unsoldered\\r\\nand separate, lacking the unity of phrases fashioned by the old\\r\\nbelievers. Together they groped in this difficult region, where the\\r\\nunfinished, the unfulfilled, the unwritten, the unreturned, came\\r\\ntogether in their ghostly way and wore the semblance of the complete and\\r\\nthe satisfactory. The future emerged more splendid than ever from this\\r\\nconstruction of the present. Books were to be written, and since books\\r\\nmust be written in rooms, and rooms must have hangings, and outside\\r\\nthe windows there must be land, and an horizon to that land, and trees\\r\\nperhaps, and a hill, they sketched a habitation for themselves upon the\\r\\noutline of great offices in the Strand and continued to make an account\\r\\nof the future upon the omnibus which took them towards Chelsea; and\\r\\nstill, for both of them, it swam miraculously in the golden light of a\\r\\nlarge steady lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the night was far advanced they had the whole of the seats on the\\r\\ntop of the omnibus to choose from, and the roads, save for an occasional\\r\\ncouple, wearing even at midnight, an air of sheltering their words from\\r\\nthe public, were deserted. No longer did the shadow of a man sing to\\r\\nthe shadow of a piano. A few lights in bedroom windows burnt but were\\r\\nextinguished one by one as the omnibus passed them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey dismounted and walked down to the river. She felt his arm stiffen\\r\\nbeneath her hand, and knew by this token that they had entered the\\r\\nenchanted region. She might speak to him, but with that strange tremor\\r\\nin his voice, those eyes blindly adoring, whom did he answer? What\\r\\nwoman did he see? And where was she walking, and who was her companion?\\r\\nMoments, fragments, a second of vision, and then the flying waters,\\r\\nthe winds dissipating and dissolving; then, too, the recollection from\\r\\nchaos, the return of security, the earth firm, superb and brilliant in\\r\\nthe sun. From the heart of his darkness he spoke his thanksgiving;\\r\\nfrom a region as far, as hidden, she answered him. On a June night the\\r\\nnightingales sing, they answer each other across the plain; they are\\r\\nheard under the window among the trees in the garden. Pausing, they\\r\\nlooked down into the river which bore its dark tide of waters, endlessly\\r\\nmoving, beneath them. They turned and found themselves opposite the\\r\\nhouse. Quietly they surveyed the friendly place, burning its lamps\\r\\neither in expectation of them or because Rodney was still there talking\\r\\nto Cassandra. Katharine pushed the door half open and stood upon the\\r\\nthreshold. The light lay in soft golden grains upon the deep obscurity\\r\\nof the hushed and sleeping household. For a moment they waited, and\\r\\nthen loosed their hands. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGood night,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d he breathed. Ã¢\\x80\\x9cGood night,Ã¢\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nmurmured back to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Night and Day, by Virginia Woolf\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NIGHT AND DAY ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 1245-0.txt or 1245-0.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/2/4/1245/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Judy Boss\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\r\\nwill be renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\r\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\r\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\r\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tmÃ¢\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service.  The FoundationÃ¢\\x80\\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your stateÃ¢\\x80\\x99s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FoundationÃ¢\\x80\\x99s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\r\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\r\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\\r\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\r\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'"
